A former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, has urged Nigerians to rededicate themselves to the virtues of love, patriotism and unity. The Vice-Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 general election made the call in his 2021 Eid-il Fitri message. The message was contained in a statement signed by his Media Director, Valentine Obienyem. It was titled, ‘Obi @ Sallah, urges spirit of oneness, peaceful co- existence…says Nigeria needs ardent prayers’. Obi charged Nigerians not to allow the prevailing hardship and mounting insecurity in the country to adversely affect their spirit of love, brotherliness and peaceful co-existence. “Rather, the people should use this year’s Eid-El Fitri festivities to engender the spirit of oneness and also re-dedicate themselves to the virtues of love, patriotism and unity for the desired national development,” he said. The ex-governor stated that Nigerians should allow the solemnness of the last one month of Ramadan to positively influence their thoughts and actions in relating with one another. “The Ramadan period presents a great opportunity for Nigerians to devote themselves to the values that unite and bind all citizens in love, while permanently putting behind them all divisive tendencies,” Obi stated while he wished all Nigerians happy Sallah celebrations and prayed for enduring peace in a secure and peaceful country.
