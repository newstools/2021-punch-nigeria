Chairperson, Nigeria Women’s Football League, Aisha Falode, says Barcelona star Asisat Oshoala is an African women’s football icon after helping the Blaugrana to their first ever Women’s Champions League on Sunday. Oshoala was a substitute as Barca trounced Chelsea women 4-0 in the final of the competition, thus becoming the first African woman to win the trophy. The four-time African Women’s Footballer of The Year, despite an injury close to the end of the season, made nine appearances and scored four goals. Falode told The PUNCH, “Asisat Oshoala has proven that she is an icon, a legend for women football. The first African to win the UEFA Women’s Champions League and she is a Nigerian. That shows that Nigeria is known for making history in women’s football. “We have Oshoala who is breaking records in all fronts, being the first woman to have won the AWCON alongside Perpetua Nkwocha a record four times. Now she has won the Champions League trophy with Barcelona. She keeps breaking records and setting the pace and making us proud as Nigerians and women. “It is also a reflection on the fact that women’s football in Nigeria still has a lot of potential and we have a lot of Asisat Oshoalas in our league, remember she started as a domestic player. She’s only building on what she learned from home abroad now.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
