The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas workers has threatened to go on nationwide strike if the Federal Government fails to caution Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, who has declared the leadership of the organised labour wanted. Should NUPENG proceed on a strike, it will affect the supply and distribution of petroleum products across the country. NUPENG said in a statement by its National President, Williams Akporeha, that it had received a report of a clandestine move of Governor El-Rufai to put the lives of the President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, and other union leaders at risk. The statement read in part, “NUPENG, therefore, warns that if any harm is inflicted on any of the members of the organised labour, the leadership of the union will not hesitate to call on all our members throughout the nation for a total shutdown of all our services in the upstream, mid-stream, downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry.” El-Rufai and the organised labour have been at war over the sacking of workers in the state. The governor is reported to have sacked over 60,000 workers since he became governor in 2015. On Tuesday he announced the sacking of lecturers and nurses for joining the strike organised by the NLC.
