It was a cascade of tears, whimpering sobs and free flow of emotions on Tuesday afternoon as the remains of Pastor Dare Adeboye was laid to rest. The 42-year-old cleric and third child of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, died last Wednesday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State. He was later buried after a Farewell Service at the Youth Centre, Redemption Camp, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. See photo:
