As a result of the rising spate of killings and kidnappings in the country, Lagos State First Lady, Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has urged parents and guardians to keep a close tab on the activities of their children and wards. The governor’s wife, who spoke on Saturday at a special Eid-El-Fitr celebration held at Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, also urged parents to be more security-conscious. This was contained in a statement signed by the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Office Of Lagos State First Lady, Olubukonla Nwonah. The statement was titled, ‘Insecurity: Keep Close Tab On Your Children, Sanwo-Olu’s Wife Tells Parents’. According the statement, the governor’s wife also advised women to preach love, unity, togetherness, everywhere they found themselves. “The same message goes to so many numerous women out there. In any gathering we find ourselves that we have been able to keep ourselves together in peace and harmony, rendering selfless service to one another, we should remember our country, Nigeria in our prayers more regularly than before because there is a lot that prayer can do; we should not give up; we should belief that we have someone up there that is more powerful. “More importantly too, as parents and guardians, we must keep a close tab on the activities of our children and wards. We all have to be vigilant and ‘say something when we see something.’ You are your first security. It starts with the individual and more than before, we must be thoroughly and extremely observant,” the statement further read. “Beyond Ramadan, it is important for us to imbibe and sustain the principles of the holy month which among others include peace, kindness, compassion and happy co-existence. The holy Prophet held these principles in high esteem and lived His whole life around them,” the statement added.
