Popular Nigerian singer, Dapo Oyebanjo, fondly known as D’banj, has revealed plans to unveil a new female signee to his record label, DB records. The self-acclaimed ‘Koko Master’ made the announcement on Thursday via his verified Instagram page, where he uploaded a poster showing the female signee but with a covered face. The poster read, “New artiste unveiling by DB records.” In the caption section, D’banj wrote, “Ladies and gentlemen, @dbrecordsofficial has a first lady. Guess who she is!” The singer launched his record label, DB records, in 2012, D’Banj, after leaving the defunct Mo-hits Records, which he co-owned with popular Nigerian beat maker, Don Jazzy. He signed his younger brother, KaySwitch, alongside two producers, Jaysleek and Deevee. He later signed brothers, MossKriss and Ralph Kriss, and the popular actress, Tonto Dikeh. The news of Tonto Dikeh’s signing to the record label was welcomed with mixed reactions as some people felt she was not recruited for her musical dexterity, but as a PR stunt for the record label. Furthermore, she released songs like ‘Hi’ and ‘Jeje’, which were also met with negative reviews and criticisms from Nigerians.
