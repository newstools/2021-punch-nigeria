The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has said it will assist in the accreditation of professional courses offered by the Nigerian Navy. The agency said it would also facilitate the attainment of International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for seafarers’ status for the Nigerian Navy’s training institutes. According to a statement by the agency on Wednesday, the Director General of NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh, stated these on Tuesday in Lagos, when the Flag Officer Commanding Naval Training Command, Rear Admiral Kamarudeen Lawal, visited NIMASA’s headquarters. Jamoh spoke in response to requests by Lawal, who said collaboration between the Nigerian Navy and NIMASA was not only required for success of the country’s maritime goals, but also inevitable. Jamoh said, “NIMASA is all for anything that will enhance safety and security in our waters and promote shipping. This is in line with our mandate. We will support and advance courses and causes geared towards maximising our maritime potential. “We would help the Nigerian Navy obtain the STCW status for its training bodies, and facilitate the accreditation of its programmes, on purpose to advance our common goal of maritime safety and security.” The FOC said the visit was in view of NIMASA’s critical role in the maintenance of standards and safety in the country’s maritime environment. According to him, the relationship between the Nigerian Navy and NIMASA had led to improved maritime safety and security in Nigerian waters. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
