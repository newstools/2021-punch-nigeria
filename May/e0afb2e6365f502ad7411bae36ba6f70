The Ogun State Governor, Mr Dapo Abiodun, has inaugurated 4.92 kilometres AIT/Raypower and Ikola-Osi Ota-Navy roads in Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of the state. The governor on Wednesday said his administration would continue to consult residents of the state on infrastructural projects they wanted the government to undertake. He said, “These roads will serve as a bypass to the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway and help to create access to commuters shuttling between Lagos and Ogun states.” While describing Ado-Odo/Ota LGA as the “industrial LGA” in Nigeria, Abiodun said the roads would create an enabling environment, enhance economic growth and improve individual prosperity along the corridor. He further stated that the construction of the roads was in tandem with the decision of his administration to construct all the connecting and access roads between Ogun and Lagos. Commending the people of the local government for their support, Abiodun stressed that the reconstruction of Agbara-Lusada-Atan industrial road would be completed in 14 months. The Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Ade Akinsanya, said the two roads were community-based projects. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
