The Lagos State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Mr Hakeem Fahm, has said the government plans to transform Lagos into an industrialised and modern state of international status. The commissioner said this on Tuesday during the ministerial press briefing of his ministry to mark the second year anniversary of the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in Alausa, Ikeja. Fahm stated that one of the mandates given to the ministry was to find innovative application of science and technology towards improving the quality of life of Lagosians. He explained that the Lagos Smart City project was one of ways the government would coordinate available resources to digitise the state. He said, “The Smart City implementation is key to our work. If you look around, you will see we have started running cables. By the time we finish, we will cover the length and breadth of the state. “It is important that we have technology in place to transmit data in order to be automated and close the digital divide in Lagos state. We are going to reach schools, government agencies, private sectors, as well as the markets, because we want to make sure that we leverage the power of technology to communicate and do business. “We want a state where people can enjoy their daily activities and have peace of mind. To that end, we have deployed cameras in the first phase of our smart city initiative. These cameras will monitor activities and movement of vehicles. We will also improve on transport and traffic management, town planning and response services for the people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
