A former Chief of Defence Staff, Lt Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro is dead. It was learnt that Dogonyaro who turned 80 in September 2020 died in Jos on Thursday morning after a brief illness. The former CDS was the officer who read the coup speech that ended the regime of Nigeria’s current President, General Muhammadu Buhari (Rtd), and brought General Ibrahim Babangida (Rtd) to power on August 27, 1985. A family source who confirmed his death said “Yes, It’s true. We just lost ‘Baba’ this morning. We cannot question God but thank him for his life.” A former Governor of Plateau State, Fidelis Tapgun described the death of the former Chief of Defence Staff as sad and a great loss to the people of the state and Nigeria in general. Tapgun who recalled his days in the military said, “I just heard of his death and it is very sad. His death is indeed a big loss not only to the people of Plateau State but to Nigerians and the military in particular because whatever history is going to be written, the military is going to take a large chapter and he is one of those whose name will be mentioned severally on every chapter because of the great roles he played for the sake of the country. “So, we thank God for his life and we pray that God will console everyone and rest his soul.”
