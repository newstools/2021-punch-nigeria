Two  suspected armed robbers have been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command in Atan-Ota, in the Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of the state. The suspects, Rasheed Ayinde, 20, and Matthew Oladipupo, 33, were arrested on Tuesday around 9.30pm while allegedly going for a robbery. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Oyeyemi said Ayinde and Oladipupo were arrested when the Divisional Police Officer at the Onipanu division, Bamidele Job, was on a routine patrol with his men and sighted the duo on a motorcycle. The PPRO said, “On sighting the policemen, the suspects made an attempt to make a U-turn, but were stopped by the team, who suspected their movement. “A search was there and then conducted on them and one locally-made pistol and one live cartridge, as well as assorted charms, were recovered from them. “On interrogation, they confessed to being on their way to carry out a robbery. “The duo claimed to be living in Abeokuta, but used to operate in the Onipanu and Atan-Ota areas.” Oyeyemi said the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation.
