Gunmen, on Monday, stormed a branch of the Deeper Life Christian Church in the Irese community, Akure South Local Government Area of Ondo State, and abducted the pastor in charge, identified as Otamayomi Ogedengbe. It was gathered that the gunmen invaded the church in a Corolla Toyota car around 9pm and whisked away the cleric to an unknown destination. A church member, who identified himself simply as Paul, said the men entered the premises of the church in a Toyota Corolla car. “The pastor was kidnapped inside the church. The kidnappers came in a black Corolla car. The pastor was the only one kidnapped alone,” he stated. A source stated that the pastor and his wife came to the church for a programme when the gunmen invaded the premises and abducted only the man. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident and said the command had begun a manhunt for the hoodlums. “We are on their trail and investigation has commenced into the matter,” the PPRO stated As of the time of filling this report, the hoodlums had not contacted the family of the victim about ransom.
