The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has commenced an investigation into the reported looting of some shops by suspected miscreants in the Kubwa area of the nation’s capital. The incident, which was captured on video, showed some youths at a demolition site, carting away property from some commercial shops in the area on Thursday. Commenting on the incident, the police spokesperson, Mariam Yusuf, said, “The attention of the FCT Police Command has been drawn to the viral video of looting on social media, suggesting that the ‘Hausas were looting southerners at Arab Road, Kubwa, Abuja.’” She explained that a preliminary investigation showed that the Development Control Department of the Federal Capital Territory Administration earlier conducted a demolition exercise at Arab Road, Kubwa but some yet-to-be-identified residents seized the opportunity to loot items from the demolition sites. The statement read, “Police operatives from Kubwa Division swiftly moved to the scene upon receiving the information to restore calm within the area and arrest the suspects. “Consequently, the Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, has ordered a discreet investigation into the incident and appeals to residents to remain calm and law-abiding.” The command implored residents to report all suspicious movements, emergency or distress through its published emergency numbers.
