Enyimba striker, Tosin Omoyele, is confident the People’s Elephant can overturn the 4-1 quarter-final first leg defeat to Pyramids when both teams clash in the second leg of the CAF Confederation Cup at the Enyimba stadium on Sunday. Goals from Ramadan Sobhi, Abdallah El-Said and a brace from Ibrahim Adel canceled out an early strike from Victor Mbaoma. Omoyele admitted Enyimba had a daunting task ahead of them, but insists they stand a chance of advancing to the semi-finals of the competition. “We were all sad that we lost the game in Egypt despite scoring first,” Omoyele told The PUNCH. “We have not given up because we know that we have the ability to overturn the result in Aba. “We have done this before and we can do it again,” Omoyele said. Fatai Osho’s side need to win by at least three unreplied goals to advance to the next stage. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
