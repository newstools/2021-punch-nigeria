The Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kaduna State has dismissed the petition brought before it by the All Progressive Congress and its candidate challenging the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party in the December 5th and 9th House of Assembly bye-election for Bakura Constituency in Zamfara State. The three-man panel of the tribunal led by Justice Raliat Adebiyi gave the unanimous judgement in Kaduna on Friday. The APC and its candidate Bello Dankande had filed a joint petition on December 20, 2020, specifically to disqualify Ibrahim Tukur of PDP, winner of the December 5th and 9th House of Assembly bye-election on the grounds that it was marred by massive irregularities. They had alleged arbitrary allocation of figures, result sheets not showing results of all political parties that participated in the election, intimidation of voters among others. The party and its candidate also claimed they only participated in the first election held on December 5th which was declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission as inconclusive. The APC and its candidate, however, lamented that the INEC went ahead to conduct a rerun on December 9 amid security lapses which prevented them(opposition) from participating. But while delivery judgement which lasted over 5 hours, the Tribunal dismissed all the ground in its entirety. The Tribunal held that petitioners failed to prove substantial non-compliance of the electoral act in most of the polling units, including allegations of thuggery and harassment of voters during the election. The Tribunal then awarded N200,000 against the petitioner in favour of the first, Ibrahim Tukur and another N200,000 in favour of the second respondent, PDP. Counsel to the PDP, Chief Mike Ozekhome(SAN) and that of the INEC, Sani Katu(SAN) described the judgement as the true reflection of what transpired during the poll.
