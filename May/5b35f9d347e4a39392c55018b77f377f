THE Delta State Government said on Tuesday that it was engaging the Federal Government in a dialogue on the €4.2m loot recovered from the former governor of the state, James Ibori. Speaking during what appeared to be his last briefing with newsmen in Asaba as the state Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, expressed optimism that the Federal Government would return the recovered funds to Delta. Aniagwu’s briefing with newsmen, which was his last as the Information commissioner, said those bringing the fund back knew its source. He said, “Delta State Government has been discussing with the Federal Government on the issue of returning the fund and we know that the Federal Government will do the needful by returning the state’s money. “We have gone far and we are looking forward to receiving the fund. We have continued to engage the FG, who has been a good father.” FG confirms receiving €4.2m Ibori loot from UK Earlier, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, confirmed that the Federal Government had received €4,214,017.66 of the loot associated with James Ibori. The minister’s Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr Jibrilu Gwandu, disclosed this in statement in Abuja on Tuesday. The statement was titled ‘Nigeria receives €4.2m Ibori loot – Malami’. According to Malami, the money has been credited to the designated Federal Government account with its naira equivalent as of May 10, 2021. “The development, according to Malami, was a demonstration of the recognition of the reputation Nigeria earns through records of management of recovered stolen funds in the execution of public-oriented projects,” the statement read.
