The wife of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, Hajara, has charged the management of various police schools in the country to encourage pupils and students to take part in competitions with other public schools. Hajara, who is the National President, Police Officer Wives Association, said this while addressing senior police officers, including the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, and members of the POWA, at the Lagos State Police Command Headquarters, in the Ikeja of the state. She said, “I am here to visit schools, because I have never seen the police children coming out in competition with other Federal Schools. Why? Are we not competent enough? Let us encourage them to come out. “Let us compete with other federal schools so we can get the awards. I will appreciate it if a police child is being sponsored through scholarship to read any course. “I am here to also speak with our women and about empowerment. It mustn’t be shops; the shops count but it mustn’t be shops. We have other ways to bring our women up. Anywhere you are and whatever you are doing, make sure you excel and you will see the reward.” Odumosu assured Hajara of the command’s commitment to the POWA and the new IGP. Copyright PUNCH.
