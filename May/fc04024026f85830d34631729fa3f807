THE Rivers State Police Command has launched a desperate search to recover eight rifles stolen by yet-to-be identified gunmen who attacked its formations and killed seven cops last Friday. A police security report obtained by our correspondent on Sunday revealed that eight rifles were stolen by the gunmen who attacked three police formations. Also, a senior police source who pleaded anonymity said leaving the weapons in the hands of high profile criminals was extremely dangerous, hence the command had spread its dragnet to ensure they were recovered. Recall that the gunmen came in two Hilux vans, including one carrying siren, and killed two policemen at a security checkpoint in Choba axis, near Port Harcourt before carting away their AK-47 rifles. Also at the Rumuji Divisional Police headquarters in Emuoha Local Government Area, the gunmen killed and beheaded two operatives and carted away their AK-47 rifles. A statement by the spokesman for the Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, said, “Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, has ordered a serious manhunt for the perpetrators with a view to bringing the culprits to justice.” Omoni in a chat with our correspondent on Sunday said, “Investigations were still on. As you know, the CP has ordered a manhunt and that is what we are working on. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
