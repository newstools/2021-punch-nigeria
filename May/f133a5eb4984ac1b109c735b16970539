The revenue base of Fintech operators in Nigeria will reach $543m by 2022, a joint report by EY Nigeria and Fintech Association of Nigeria has said. This growth would be driven by increase in smartphone penetration, and unbanked population, the report said. Even though in 2019, Nigeriaâ€™s first unicorn, Interswitch, was born, its Fintech industry is still classified as developing when compared to jurisdictions such as the UK, Singapore, Australia, Sweden, and India. In 2020, Fintechs raised an estimate $439m, an equivalent of 20 per cent of total amount raised by tech startups in Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the Nigerian economy, with dwindling revenue but it created opportunities for Fintechs to contribute to economic growth, with the number of online transactions spiking up. At the beginning of the pandemic, the volume of e-payment transactions was 366 million by Q1 2020, a 57 per cent increase from Q12019. About 56 million Nigerians are unbanked, and Fintech continues to lead the way in reaching them. This is showing in an increased investor focus on payments and digital banking. Copyright PUNCH.
