‘Elina’, a movie that dwells on the rising state of insecurity in the country was premiered on Sunday, May 16, at Silverbird Galleria, Victoria Island, Lagos, and was well attended by actors such as Jibola Dabo, Kalu Ikeagwu and Felix Omokhodion, who also starred in the movie. According to Edita Francis, the producer of the movie, it was inspired by the current happenings in Nigeria, especially the rising rate of kidnapping and child abuse. Francis told Saturday beats, “The movie is based on a true life story. These days, some parents are not usually careful with their children. They go out chasing money and ignore their primary responsibilities, which is to take care of their kids. The film focuses on those special areas, especially the psychological effects of those abuses on children.” Felix Omokhodion, who plays the role of a kidnapper in the movie told our correspondents that there are lots of lessons to learn from it. He said, “It is a beautiful story that everyone would love to watch. It is educating, entertaining and there are a lot of lessons to learn. It is a must watch for everyone. It also focuses on the psychological damages that kidnapped and abused kids go through”. On his part, veteran actor, Jibola Dabo, noted that he had a wonderful time acting in the movie. He said, “The story focuses on the laxity on the part of some parents. We all know the current security situation of the children and parents have to be very careful and sensitive about the safety of their children. One can never be too careful when dealing with kids. I really had a wonderful experience on the set.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
