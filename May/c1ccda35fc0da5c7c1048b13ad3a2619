Some family members of late Chief of Air Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, have described him as a patient person and core gentleman. The family members made the remarks when a correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria visited the late COAS family house on Abuja Road, Doka Area of Kaduna on Saturday. Alhaji Sani Musa, 85, an elder brother to Attahiru, said the deceased was always there for the family. “Right from his childhood, he was a hardworking, honest person. “Though l left for Bauchi when Ibrahim was in primary school, we kept in touch up to the time Allah took his life,” Musa said. Another family member, Ibrahim Musa, 83, said the late COAS loved his family and was always patient with them “no matter how you hurt him. “It’s hard for him to be angry, rather he will call your attention and tell you what he believed is right.” He said the family would miss him and prayed for Allah to forgive the deceased and grant him Aljannah Firdaus.
