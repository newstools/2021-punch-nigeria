THE wife of a pastor, Otamayomi Ogedengbe, who was kidnapped at his church located in Irese, Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, has called on the security agencies in the state to secure the release of her husband. Pastor Ogedengbe of the Deeper Life Christian Church was abducted inside the church on Monday evening by some gunmen who reportedly came to the church in a Corolla Toyota car. Speaking on Wednesday, the wife of the victim, Yinka called on Nigerians to help secure the release of her husband, saying the bandits had not contacted the family for ransom. Narrating how her husband was abducted, Yinka said the hoodlums entered the premises of the church, took their time to search for her husband before they forcefully took him away. She said some church members made attempt to pursue the hoodlums but the kidnappers were shooting indiscriminately to scare people away. She said, “Monday was our Bible study day. Immediately after the Bible study, we were rounding off when one of our brothers collected the car key to park it properly. He met some boys outside. “He said the boys pushed him down from the car and he thought they wanted to collect the car. They slapped him and when they looked at him properly and discovered he was not the person they were looking for, they brought him inside the church and started searching for who they were looking for. “They saw my husband and said he was the person. When we got outside, they started shooting and they pushed my husband into their car. We drove after them towards Irese road but they were shooting at us. It was dark; so, we stopped. Since then we have not heard anything from them (kidnappers). “May God help me to bring my husband back. He is the only son of his parents. Nigerians should help secure the release of my husband.” The state Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, said he had directed his men to rescue the pastor unhurt.
