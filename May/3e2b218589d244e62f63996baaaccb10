The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria has urged the government to avoid introducing taxes without considering the impact it would have on businesses. The President, CITN, Dame Olajumoke Simplice, made the call during the 44th induction ceremony of the institute in Lagos. She said, “At governmental level, it is important that tax policy initiatives and reviews in tax laws are well thought out and followed through. “We have consciously seen government’s efforts in the amendment of our tax laws through the Finance Act, 2019 followed by the Finance Act, 2020. “Government must avoid the propensity to introduce earmarked taxes with the intention of raising revenues while neglecting the impact that such action would have on businesses and economic activities. “As a matter of fact, the thinking of Section 2.2.6 of the Revised National Tax Policy 2017 is that our ‘taxes should be few in number, broad-based and high revenue-yielding’.” Simplice said the administration of the taxes should be simplified for ease of enforcement and compliance. The CITN president admonished the inductees to be at the vanguard of professionalism in their conduct at all times. “We will benefit from your active involvement in all institute’s activities as this is one of the ways you can contribute your quota to the growth and development of the institute,” she said. She said as with other professions, there was a code of conduct for members that should be strictly adhered t Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
