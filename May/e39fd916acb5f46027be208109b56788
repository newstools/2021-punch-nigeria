The flag of the Nigerian Army is currently flying at half mast at its headquarters in Abuja. This is in honour of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and others who died in the Beachcraft 350 aircraft that crashed at the Kaduna International Airport on Friday. As of the time our correspondent visited the headquarters of the Nigerian Army located within the Armed Forces Complex in Garki, Abuja about 10.30am on Saturday, only the Army flag was flying at half-mast. The national and the military flags were however flying full mast. Some senior officers dressed in military ceremonial outfit were seen being driven out of the premises probably to the venue of the burial programmes of Attahiru and others. Soldiers on sentry duty were seen watching movements around the premises with keen attention. As expected, the premises looked deserted since itâ€™s weekend. The premises of the Nigeria Defence College located on Herbert Macaulay Way also looked deserted as of the time our correspondent visited.
