Operatives of Benue State Police Command have foiled a kidnap attempt on the Bursar of the Federal University of Agriculture(now known as Joseph Sarwuan Tarka University) Makurdi, Mr. Emmanuel Timothy. The principal suspect, Terwase Agbem Paul, popularly known as TAP was arrested for allegedly masterminding the kidnap. Also arrested alongside Terwase was his accomplice, Mr. Mson Yaasa. Both claimed to be in their 30s. The duo was arrested last Saturday at about 1200hrs following a tip-off. It was reliably gathered that men of Operation Zenda led by Commander Operation Zenda, CSP Justine Gberindyer, raided their hideout at Ankpa Quarters in Makurdi where the suspects were arrested. The suspects were alleged to specialise in organising high-profile kidnappings of politicians and wealthy personalities within Abuja and Makurdi and other parts of the country. The Command spokesperson, DSP Catherine Anene, who confirmed the arrest said that the Command acted on information that a kidnap gang was re-grouping around Ankpa Quarters in Makurdi. “A team of Police officers was deployed to trail and arrest the suspects. “On 22/05/2021 at about 1200hrs, these suspects had assembled at Ankpa Quarters, Makurdi and perfected plans to carry out their nefarious act when the operatives invaded their hideout and arrested the kingpin, one Paul Terwase Agbem also known as Top of Gwarimpa, Abuja and one Mson Yaasa of Adikpo, Kwande Local Government Area. Anene said that the suspects had confessed to having completed plans on the same day to kidnap a staff of the Joseph Sawuan Tarka University of Agriculture, Makurdi who allegedly refused to pay him money for the contract he executed in the school. “Efforts are in progress to arrest the fleeing suspects,” Anene said.
