The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Abubakar III has demanded explanations from the Federal government concerning the loots it had recovered. The Sultan, represented by the Wazirin Sokoto, Prof. Sambo Junaidu, spoke at the zonal dialogue with stakeholders on the ‘National Ethics and Integrity Policy’ in Sokoto, organized by the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the North-West zone of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission on Tuesday. The Sultan pointed out that maintaining silence on the issue of loot recovery would disrupt the war against corruption in Nigeria, according to Daily Trust. “The government owes Nigerians an explanation; we want to know how much billions of naira was recovered from our past leaders, where the monies are, and what are they doing with them? “This explanation is necessary considering the state of our education and other infrastructure like roads, which need serious government attention,” he said. This call comes shortly after the Federal Government received £4.2m looted by a former Governor of Delta State, James Ibori, from the United Kingdom. The PUNCH had reported that the Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris, claimed that he had returned the recovered fund to Delta state. However, this is contrary to the earlier position of the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, who recently stated that the state could not benefit from the recovered loot, stressing that Nigeria would execute other projects with the fund. Meanwhile, the Delta State Government said it was yet to receive the £4.2m recovered fund from the Federal Government as announced by the Accountant General of the Federation.
