Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has declared Friday, May 14, 2021 as a work-free day to enable Muslim faithful continue with the Eid-el-Fitr celebrations. The State Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, announced this in a statement on Thursday. He said the decision was in consideration of the fact that Wednesday, which was part of the two-day Eid holiday declared by the Federal Government fell within the 30 days of Ramadan. The governor, according to the statement, felicitated with the Muslim Ummah on this auspicious period that calls for sober reflection and sharing of goodwill among adherents. It also urged people in the state to use the occasion, particularly during Jumuâ€™at service to pray for peace to continue to reign in the state and the country in general.
