A budding singer, Anosike Ugochi, aka Ugoccie, has urged women to be vocal about their feelings. Sharing the inspiration behind her new song, Do You Really Love Me, she told Sunday Scoop, “I wrote the song for men that trick women into sleeping with them by claiming to love them. I want more vocal women to exist— ladies that can talk about their feelings without feeling biased. And, ladies who can ask men what they really want.” On how music began for her, Ugoccie said, ”I have always enjoyed doing ‘cover’ versions of other people’s songs even before I became an on-air-personality . Being a radio girl was and still is a part of my life that I’m grateful for. My first viral ‘cover’ was the ‘One ticket’ song by Kizz Daniel. That was the first big move.” The budding singer also noted that she handled attention from male fans by telling them off kindly. She said, “I get a lot of advances from men. However, I kindly tell them off but make sure I don’t do that in a rude manner.” On the challenges she has encountered in the course of her music career, the singer said, “One major challenge I had in the past was finding a place to record my songs. However, I now have a studio at home for myself, so I don’t have to wait for people. I recorded my latest song myself.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
