The Chairman of the Audit Committee Institute, Christian Ekeigwe, has called for the establishment of the Akintola Williams University of Africa. He described Akintola Williams as the father of the accountancy profession not only in Nigeria, but Africa. Ekeigwe, a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria and Certified Public Accountant (Massachusetts), noted that the varsity would be a constant reminder of the contributions of Williams to the accounting profession in Africa. A statement on Sunday said the institute chairman made the call in his ‘Letter to my Profession III’ article, titled, ‘A Pithy Call for Akintola Williams University of Africa – Generational Gratitude Matters.” “The Akintola Williams University of Africa should also be a brand-new institution, not a remake or renaming of some ossified institution with superannuated infrastructure, malodorous culture; it should not be an ostensible educational institution, but which exists only as a modern engine of credentialism.  (And it will be diminishing to just name a department of accounting in a university or college or a building after him.)  Such an institution might be beset by aspecific hysteresis that defies forces of progress,” he added. Ekeigwe expressed worry for the future of the accounting profession in the country, saying the current generation of accountants had evidently “developed aliteracy, and is being taken by credentialism without true empowering education, but with rush to solve hedonistic, instant gratification inclinations.” Copyright PUNCH.
