The President of Super Parents Foundation, Mofoluwasho Liasu, has tasked government at all levels to include children and persons living with disabilities into their programmes and policies. Liasu said this on Sunday in Ibadan, Oyo State, in an interview with our correspondent on the sidelines of the 2021 Inclusive Children’s Party organised for children with disabilities by the Super Parents Foundation. Liasu, who  is a lawyer, advised parents who have children with disabilities not to hide them but to show them love and take proper care of them, saying their talents would begin to manifest when they were well taken care  for. She said, “Government should make sure that there are ramps on the roads and at public buildings to enable these special children access these places. They should make sure they include ramps on the roads and make sure that they are built to specifications. “Government should also make sure that these children access quality education at no cost. There should also be free healthcare for them. Taking care of children with disabilities is a very tough job and it can impoverish an average parent.” The Commissioner for Education in Oyo State, Olasunkanmi Olaleye, commended the foundation, caregiver and parents talking care of children with disabilities. The commissioner , who was represented by the Deputy Director, Special Education, Ministry of Education, Oyo State, Mr Rotimi Omotoso, said the  contributions of those taking care of special children was unquantifiable. One of the parents who have a child with disability, Mrs Modupe Ajayi, also commended the the foundation which she said she was introduced to in 2019. ”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
