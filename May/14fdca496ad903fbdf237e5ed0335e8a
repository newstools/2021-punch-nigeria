There is voter apathy in the local government elections holding across the 33 councils in Oyo State today. Our correspondent, who is monitoring the exercise in some areas, observed a low turnout of voters. The roads are virtually deserted due to the restriction of movement order from 6 am to 3 pm. But around Agbowo, youths are seen playing football on the roads and many of them are not ready to participate in the exercise. At Ward 12 Unit 1 in Agbowo area, a voter, Ismail Aderibigbe, told our correspondent that electoral officers arrived on time, and accreditation and voting were done simultaneously without any hitch. There were reports of low turnout of voters in Ibadan, Ogbomoso, and other parts of the state. However, turnout was said to be impressive in Saki West, Saki East, and other areas. The State Independent Electoral Commission headed by Isiaka Olagunju (SAN) had vowed to ensure that the polls are credible. Seventeen political parties are said to be participating in the election excluding the All Progressives Congress. The chairman of OYSIEC had said the APC was given the opportunity to participate in the election and that he personally went to their secretariat and persuaded them but the party refused, citing the case filed by dissolved local government elected officials at the Supreme Court as an excuse. The case was determined on May 7 in favour of the elected officials but the OYSIEC said it could no longer accommodate the APC in the poll because election materials had been printed and all the parties were ready. The APC had made the last-minute attempt to stop the poll on Thursday but there were allegations that hoodlums stopped them from entering the court premises.
