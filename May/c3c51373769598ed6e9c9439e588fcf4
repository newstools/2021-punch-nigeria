The Northern Youth Leaders Forum has blamed the pervading insecurity in the country on former President Goodluck Jonathan. The NLYF, a coalition of northern socio-political groups, argued that the country would have been spared the current security challenges if Jonathan had respected the agreement he reached with northern state governors and leaders of thought to only serve one term, following the death of the late President Musa Yar’Adua. The NLYF Chairman, Elliot Afiyo, said this while speaking with journalists in Yola on Saturday. Afiyo said though the coalition had been championing rotational presidency, it had now changed its mind as the country needed to look beyond the regions to get a President capable of dealing with the current security challenges. According to him, a “coalition or cabal is behind the current security situation being faced by the country.” The NLYF chairman said, “With what is going on in this country, we need to bring anybody from anywhere in this country to deal with the situation. “If you flash back to the Jonathan regime, you will observe that Jonathan was ready and willing to deal with the security situation, but some people, especially from the North (undermined him) – we have evidence. A coalition or cabal benefitting from the insecurity is causing the insecurity in this country. And you need somebody with a lion heart to deal with it. That is why we threw the presidency open.” He added, “If Jonathan had agreed on that one term, we wouldn’t have been having all these insecurity (challenges) that we are having.” Copyright PUNCH.
