The  Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, says his administration has made giant strides in the area of health care, housing, education and infrastructure, among others. Abiodun said this during a broadcast on Saturday to mark two years of his administration, adding that no fewer than 7,800 health workers were enjoying health insurance. Abiodun mentioned health care as one of the areas his administration achieved success. He said, “The number of ambulances in the state has increased from five to 30 with provision of 24-hour ambulance service. We have restructured the Ogun State Health Insurance Scheme to make it more efficient and affordable. “The provision of health infrastructure and other initiatives are complemented with incentives to motivate the workforce. The incentives include upward review of salaries and allowances of health workers, provision of health insurance for 7,800 health care workers, and recruitment of over 300 health personnel across various cadres for the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital. No fewer than 100 Primary Healthcare Centres have either been rebuilt or newly constructed and adequately equipped in line with World Health Organisation. Our target is to have at least a functional PHC in each of our 236 wards.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
