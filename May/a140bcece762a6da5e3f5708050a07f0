THE House of Representatives has invited heads of military, paramilitary and intelligence agencies to its national security summit. The House had on April 27, 2021, held a prolonged executive (closed-door) session to discuss the rising spate of insecurity across Nigeria, after which the lawmakers unanimously adopted a series of resolutions, which the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, read out to the public. Apart from calling on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to declare a state of emergency on security, the lawmakers had also said, “The House should urgently invite the NSA, service chiefs and paramilitary chiefs, Controller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service, and the MD of NIGCOMSAT to brief the House on the security situation in the country.” Gbajabiamila had later on April 28, 2021, said the four-day summit being organised by the House’ Special Ad Hoc Committee on Security made up of the Speaker, all principal officers and 30 members, would hold between May 24 and 28, 2021. When contacted via the telephone to confirm if the service chiefs had been invited and before whom they would appear, Chairman of the House Committee on Defence, Mr Babajimi Benson, said they (service chiefs) were expected to address the lawmakers at the forthcoming national security summit being organised by the House. “They are coming to the security summit,” Benson said. Benson also disclosed the likely date that the 12 Super Tucano fighter jets procured by the Nigerian Government from the United States in 2018 would be arriving. According to him, the aircraft will tentatively arrive on July 29. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
