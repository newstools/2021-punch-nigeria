Two persons were arrested at two different locations in the Akoko area of Ondo State over the issue of kidnapping on Thursday. This came when one of the abducted farmers, Ade Gbodi, was released after an undisclosed amount of money was paid as ransom but the second farmer is still in the kidnappers’ den. Gbodi was reportedly kidnapped on his way home from the farm along Oke Agbe-Ikaramu Road while the second farmer Ishiaku Wakili was abducted along Ikaramu-Akunnu Road on Tuesday. But it was gathered that Gbodi had been released after the ransom payment while the security agencies were still in the bush searching for the second victim. A source narrated that one of the suspected kidnappers was arrested while roaming about and allegedly dressed as a mad man. A source said, “The Vice-Chairman of the Akoko North-East Local Government Area, Mr Deji Obayan, around 4pm when he was going to his hometown, Akunu Akoko on Thursday, saw a man trekking with luggage in his head like a madman. He then accosted him and asked for his mission in the area and the suspect said he was going to Lokoja. Obayan noticed that he (the suspect) spoke flawless English and coherently but the dressing was rough. ” The Vice-Chairman now called on members of Akunu vigilante group who came to carry him to the military post in Akunu upon which an ATM , soapbox, black dresses, and black underwear were found in his luggage. He had been transferred to Ikare Divisional Police Station for investigation.” The source added that the second suspect was arrested at Ajowa Akoko with an army identity card and a mobile phone. He said the suspect too had been handed over to Okeagbe Akoko Police Station for further interrogation and investigation. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the arrest and said the police were still interrogating the suspects.
