All Progressives Congress chieftain, Bola Tinubu, has urged Nigerians to put politics aside and pray for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for strength and wisdom to protect the nation. He made this call on Wednesday in his Eid-el-Fitr message titled, ‘Let righteous acts, efforts of Ramadan continue to guide our actions’. Tinubu, who joined Muslims in Nigeria and across the world to mark the completion of this year’s Ramadan fast, stressed that the fasting is a sign of complete devotion to God. He, therefore, urged Nigerians to remember the lessons of Ramadan. “We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian,” he said. The APC chieftain also urged Nigerians to put politics aside and continue to pray for Buhari and his government. “Let us put politics aside and continue to pray to Almighty Allah for our country and all its people. “Let us remember President Muhammadu Buhari and his government in our prayers that they may be given the requisite strength and wisdom to protect the nation, defeat the challenges that confront us and help establish Nigeria as a more prosperous and just land,” he stressed. Tinubu also emphasised that Nigerians should pray for soldiers and those that are in the frontline against the war on terrorism and coronavirus pandemic.
