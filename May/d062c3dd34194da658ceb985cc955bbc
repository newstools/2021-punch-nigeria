The Architects Registration Council of Nigeria said it had laid the foundation for a multi-million naira project in Abuja which would be named ARCON House when completed. It also said the council’s Lagos office, which was still under massive renovation was about 60 per cent completed. In a statement, it said the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, President, ARCON, Dipo Ajayi, among other dignitaries, witnessed the foundation laying ceremony. Fashola expressed delight over the progress made by ARCON and called on Nigerians to learn from the council by managing differences in order to achieve common goals, it stated. He said, “This is a much better place for the architectural family to be. Three years ago, when this council took over, it was buffeted with many crises but it had been able to manage and resolve many of those issues for the benefit of all. “We all can only learn from the architects that despite our differences, we can still forge a common front of building than tearing apart. To do this, we need to tolerate and listen to one another.” In his goodwill message, Ishaku, who is also an architect pledged his support for the project. Ajayi thanked Fashola for his interventions as well as FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, for the allocation of landed property. Ajayi assured that the edifice would adopt green technology and disclosed the commitment towards the completion of the project within the required framework. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
