The police and the Department of State Services’ operatives have rescued 14 persons abducted by kidnappers in the Byazhin, Kubwa area of Bwari Area Council in Abuja. The victims, who were kidnapped at Gaweaka by the gunmen, were rescued at the Bwari hills by a combined team of police and DSS operatives on Thursday. The FCT police spokesperson, Mariam Yusuf, said, “The operation has been going on for some weeks. We have been working hard, combing hills and forests and our efforts paid off on Thursday as we rescued 14 persons abducted by kidnappers in Byazhin, Bwari axis of the Federal Capital Territory. The operation was conducted in collaboration with the DSS and vigilantes in the area.” This happened as two residents of the Byazhin area  kidnapped by gunmen have regained their freedom after allegedly paying N2m. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the two men, Mr Ayodele Somorin and Mr Oladimeji Josiah, a carpenter, were kidnapped in their homes on May 21. The victims were, however, released after spending about five days in the kidnappers’ den. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
