TENSION is building up in Illushi community, Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State over the alleged killing of some youths by soldiers. The soldiers were purportedly brought to the community by a company said to be venturing into agriculture in the area. The community also accused one Samuel Offor of leasing 5,000 hectares of their land to the company identified as Skaff Agro Farms Limited without the consent of the people. It was gathered that the land was allegedly leased while a tussle for a traditional stool was pending in court. Reacting to the allegation, Offor said he knew nothing about the killings and that the people had been fighting with him over his property just as the Managing Director of the company, Anthony Skaff, debunked all the allegations leveled against him and his company. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer, 4 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Major Ojo Adenegan, ended the call immediately the subject was brought up and did not pick repeated calls. Speaking with newsmen on Thursday, the youth leader of Illushi, Mr Lucky Chibogwu, said the incident happened on April 13, 2021, at about 3pm, insisting that soldiers came into the community, shooting, beating up people and killing three persons. Corroborating the account, Pa Richard Aghedo, said, “On the fateful day, a truckload of soldiers came into our community and started shooting and beating everybody. Before we knew it, three persons were shot dead; even till now, four of our youths are still missing. We didn’t do anything, we didn’t fight them.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
