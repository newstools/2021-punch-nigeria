No fewer than five gunmen were killed and six arrested by security operatives during a failed attempt to attack a police division in Eleme Local Government Area of Rivers State on Friday. It was learnt that the gunmen who were camped at a forest between Oyigbo and Eleme LGAs preparatory to the launch of the attack were ambushed by security operatives following an intelligence report. A source said on sighting the security operatives the hoodlums opened fire, leading to a gun battle that left five of the gunmen killed and scores arrested. “Many of them who came from the Oyigbo axis on their way to Eleme were killed. More than six of them were arrested by the police. “The body of those killed were thrown into a Hilux van,” the source said. “The development caused panic in the area due to the loud sound of gunshots that rented the air early in the morning,” he added. When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, said he was yet to get a report of the incident, but promised to contact the relevant division and get back to our correspondent.
