Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Republic of Togo, Debo Adesina, has assured that Nigeria will triumph in its fight against insecurity. The ambassador said this on Monday while receiving officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, at the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Lome, Togo. While speaking on the current security challenges in Nigeria, the West African sub-region, and the African continent at large, the ambassador pointed out that through courage and resilience, Nigerians and Africans will triumph.  “The nativity of courage and resilience to our continent, the integrity of African peoples, the decency of our being and the faith we have nurtured in ourselves throughout history, even in the face of greater adversities, will ensure our triumph,” he said. Adesina also challenged the officers and men of AFCSC to thoroughly find solutions in ending the insecurity prevalent in the West African sub-region. “We have a blessed and great region. And we must be the trigger for Africa’s peace and prosperity,” Adesina added. The ambassador also thanked the visitors for committing themselves to the safety and protection of the territorial integrity of their countries. The AFCSC team led by Brig. Gen. Mohammed Tanimu Abdullahi included officers from Nigeria, the Republic of Benin, Cameroun, Ghana, and the host country, Togo.
