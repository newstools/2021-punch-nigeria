The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has expressed worry over the Federal Government’s apathy towards the scandal rocking the Niger Delta Development Commission. In a statement on Wednesday, the governor said the region had enough money to build infrastructure and revive the economy, noting that the region should take the initiative by stopping interference in the NDDC. He said, “I am worried that the Federal Government seems not to care about the scandals associated with the NDDC. We have enough money in the region to build infrastructure and revive the economy. We can do it ourselves by stopping the interference. “In the South-South, we must stand up to defend ourselves economically, politically and security wise. We have pretenders in the region who try to exploit the region and we must stop them. “The current structure of the NDDC has caused underdevelopment in the region, with the federal government not showing any concern. “What is going on in NDDC today is totally untenable. NDDC can’t do any work in Edo and other states in the South-South. You can’t use the resources meant for the region to develop other regions of the country.” He reiterated the call for the restructuring of the NDDC to drive development of the South-South.
