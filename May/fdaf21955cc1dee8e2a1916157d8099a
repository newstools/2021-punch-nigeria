Peace Akinyode Nigerians in different parts of the country risk being plunged into another period of blackout as the national grid suffers another system collapse. According to an earlier report by The PUNCH, the collapse occurred around 11 am on Wednesday, and was confirmed by two of the country’s electricity distribution companies: Kaduna Electric via Twitter and Eko Electricity Distribution Company Plc, via separate messages to customers. The grid, which is being managed by the government-owned Transmission Company of Nigeria, has suffered system collapse several times over the years due to lack of spinning reserve: a generation capacity that can respond within 10 minutes to compensate for generation or transmission outages. Lamenting on the frequent occurrence of the system collapse and resulting blackout, Nigerians have taken to social media to react to the recent development. @HnanenD on Twitter opined that “Having and operating a spinning reserve should be the most elementary thing to achieve in Nigeria’s complex power sector.” “It would have been better if we had just poor transmission capacity to contend with, this clearly indicates far more trouble than anticipated”, he added. @unclemeks demanded that the President provides a spinning reserve to prevent future reoccurrence. He wrote, “@MBuhari give Nigeria a spinning reserve to forestall these frequent grid collapses! It won’t cost us our entire annual budget sir.” Lamenting on the deplorable state of the power sector, @BurstBurster  said, “ After 60years Nigeria is still grappling with electricity failures and collapses, what else do you call a failed state?” “It seems some people are always tampering with this grid. Collapsing almost everytime,” another commenter, @iamlamide wrote on Twitter. @i_am_benard, on Instagram, recommended that the country should resort to other means of generating electricity. “Let’s get Nigeria off grid and use sustainable renewable energy.” He chimed.
