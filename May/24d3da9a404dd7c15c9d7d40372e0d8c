Some 300-level students of Geology Department at the Osun State University, Osogbo, are protesting the decision of the school management to make them embark on a field trip to Edo State without their mobile phones. Some of the affected students, who do not want their names in print, told our correspondent that they were scheduled to travel to Igarra, Edo State for Technical Mapping. They said they were surprised when they were told that they could not travel with their mobile phones. One of them said, “Our examination was postponed because of this trip and we were told that we could not go with our phones. “How can you tell us to travel without our phone? We can’t call our families; we can’t do anything.” The university’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Kola Adesoji, confirmed that the students were asked not to embark on the trip with their mobile phones. Adesoji said, “It is the security team that advised the management that the only way they can embark on the trip is for lecturers and students to work as a team, which means the security team and their lecturer will be the only ones that will have access to utility phones. “The two utility phones will be tracked for security purposes. So, anybody that wants to communicate will use those phones.” While saying the decision was taken in March, Adesoji said the management had since cancelled the trip because of the level of insecurity in the country. But the students, who spoke with our correspondent, said they were not told that the trip had been cancelled. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
