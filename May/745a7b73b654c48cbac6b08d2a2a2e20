The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Brazilian Embassy have made a pledge to strengthen their partnership to tackle cybercrime, fraud, and other crimes affecting the economies of Nigeria and Brazil. This decision was made by both parties on Wednesday when the EFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, paid a courtesy visit to the Brazilian Embassy in Abuja. The Brazilian Ambassador, Ricardo Araujo, while receiving the EFCC boss, expressed regret about the activities of fraudsters targeted at foreigners and foreign businesses. The Ambassador posited that though he had noticed that only few Nigerians were involved in fraudulent activities, such activities can threaten the Nigerian image and the quest for direct foreign investment in the country. He, therefore, appealed to the EFCC to assist in monitoring the activities of fraudsters that are targeted at Brazilian businesses. Consequently, both parties agreed to strengthen law enforcement interactions by designating desk officers to enhance the exchange of information between both parties. The EFCC boss was accompanied on the visit by the Director of Legal and Prosecution, Chile Okoroma, Director of Operations, Abdulkarim Chukkol, amongst others.
