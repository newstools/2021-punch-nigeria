Starlink was specially launched for areas around the world with expensive, unavailable or unreliable internet. 2. SpaceX, through Starlink, plans to install 12,000 satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to enable internet connection to everyone on the planet. While 8,000 satellites will orbit from 500km above planet level, the rest 4,000 will orbit at about 1,200km above the planet. 3. Starlink is designed as a telecommunications carrier and would be able to receive funding from the Rural Digital Opportunity in increasing its coverage reach. 4. Sixty-five times closer to earth than traditional satellites, Starlink satellites will deliver high-speed broadband Internet to areas where the ground infrastructure is missing. 5. Starlink hopes to offer an internet speed of 10Gbps (gigabytes per second), which is much faster than fiber internet.
