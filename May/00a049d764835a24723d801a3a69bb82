Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has called on governors to stop waiting on the Federal Government before they can tackle insecurity in the nation. In a statement released on Sunday titled, ‘Nigeria Is drifting: We must stop waiting for Godot,’ Atiku emphasised the need for all governors to convene a national unity summit to tackle insecurity in the country. “For too long, we have erroneously thought that the power to make effective changes lies at Aso Rock. But without the states, nobody can get to Aso Rock,” he said. Referring to the fact that some governors have met earlier, Atiku still posits that it is better for all governors to meet and find solutions rather than wait on the Federal Government. He said, “I call on Nigerian governors to stop waiting on Abuja to make changes, and instead convene a National Unity Summit of all Nigerian governors to iron out the thorny issues affecting the destiny of our nation until they figure out a way to resolve them. “Forget about your party. Forget about your tribe. Respect your religion and allow it to bring out the better part of you. Meet together. Talk together. Come up with the solutions to all our collective challenges. “And then go back to your states, and consult with your federal and state legislators, with a view to getting them to work with their colleagues to implement the solutions you came up with,” Atiku said According to him, this is “how to save Nigeria” as he goes further to describe waiting for the Federal Government to effect changes as “a luxury we cannot afford.”
