Telecommunication company, 9mobile, has announced recommencement of Subscriber Identity Module card activation at their experience cenrtres nationwide. This is the first move by any Nigerian telecommunication after the Federal Government last week lifted the  ban on activation of new SIM . The Chief Commercial Officer, Stjepan Udovicic, commenting on this move, said it was because of the company’s commitment to the welfare of customers. He said, “At 9mobile, our customers’ interest remains our priority. We know several people were affected when the ban was announced, and they had been looking forward to its lifting. So, we deemed it expedient to start immediately for our customers’ sakes. “As it stands now, we are the first telecommunication company to restart activating SIM cards in our Experience Centres, and that attests to our preparedness. Customers only need to walk into our stores, and we would activate their SIM cards. Quality and efficiency are the gold standards of our operation, hence our decision.”
