Cordros Capital Limited, in its weekly report, said despite the shortened trading week, the bulls regained control of the market following a flawless victory over the bears in the three trading sessions of the week. “We observed that buying interests were largely concentrated in banking stocks,” it said. On what to expect this week, Cordros Capital said, “We do not think the bulls will repeat the flawless victory that ensued this week as the bears are likely to book profit across most counters. Consequently, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading takes centre stage ahead of a critical MPC meeting scheduled later in the month. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Copyright PUNCH.
