Summitech Computing Limited has announced plans to launch upgrades to its hospital management software in the coming weeks. The Chief Executive Officer and Founder, Summitech Computing Limited, Adekunle Kunle-Hassan, was quoted in a statement as saying, “To strengthen our health system and make it uncompromised, effective and efficient, Summitech recognised the gap and introduced the first version of Indigo. “The software is one that finds ways of trimming financial and human resource waste and make the system responsive to the real health needs of the people and enhance the hospital visit experience.” According to him, Indigo was built with the aim of digitising patient records, reducing patient wait time, improving hospital management of its inventory and payments, and access to comprehensive reports. “Initial tests have proven the software to achieve a fully utilised and efficient hospital management system. This is currently used across eight healthcare centres in Nigeria, including the largest eye clinic in Sub-Saharan Africa,” Kunle-Hassan said at a virtual event. The upgrades are expected to roll out in conjunction with an expansion programme to increase the reach of the company, according to the Chief Operating Officer, Summitech Computing, Babatope Olosunde, said “We ensure that hospitals, developers and other clients alike can look forward to a high standard of execution, speed, and great quality products. “Our IT technical support goes beyond monitoring and maintaining computer systems and networks of our clients, we ensure that their businesses are transformed into profitable and data-driven organisations where collaborations and access to mission-critical data is achieved.” Copyright PUNCH.
