Less than a week after a gas explosion in Abeokuta, another explosion happened on Monday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, killing two persons and injured three others. The incident which occurred in conference hotel owned by former governor Gbenga Daniel, reportedly happened around 12pm when a technician was filling an automatic door at the entrance of the hotel. Our correspondent gathered that the technician and one other believed to be one of the workers died instantly, while three others reportedly sustained varying degrees of injury. The injured were taken to the Federal Medical Centre, Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, while the remains of the dead were deposited at the general hospital morgue in Abeokuta. The hotel’s facilities manager, Tunde Oshunnubi, said, “During the routine maintenance of the automatic revolving door at the hotel reception, the maintenance technician used gas to weld the door hinges. “The oxyacetylene gas cylinder suddenly exploded, killing the technician and one other person yet to be identified. “Three people were wounded and were immediately taken to hospital. They are responding to treatment. So far no sabotage is suspected.” “It is suspected that the gas cylinder purchased at the open market may be fake and unable to withstand gas pressure. “Information reveals that a similar incident occurred in another location in Abeokuta sometime ago with similar casualties. “The management of the hotel sympathises with the families of the deceased and warn the general public of the presence of fake gas cylinders in the market.” Copyright PUNCH.
