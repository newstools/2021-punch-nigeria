Some Masons in Jos have lamented the prevailing scarcity of labourers at construction sites in the area, blaming the situation on the commencement of the farming season. Some of the masons, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria, on Monday, said it had become very difficult to get labourers on construction sites now, as most of them had moved to the countrysides to engage in farming activities. “Even when you find labourers and employ them, after one day they would take permission to travel,” one of the masons, Mr Pius Babale, said. Another one, Mr Tunde Gbenga, who resides in Tudunwada, Jos, said that movement of labourers to villages for farming had become a seasonal practice, but that this year’s own was massive. Also, Mr Cletus Long observed that the situation was expected as foodstuff and other essential commodities had become expensive and had compelled the labourers to look for a solution. One of the labourers, Mr Gideon Bala, said that they used to earn between N1500 and N1000 daily, which he said was not meeting their needs. “I have a farm in my village in Bokkos; so I travel to farm during farming seasons to make ends meet,” Bala said. Another one, Mr Dung Pam, also explained that he engaged in farming because of the high prices of foodstuff in the market. “I have three children and they must eat and go to school, so I use the farming season to farm , I also sell the surplus to my neighbours,” Pam said.
