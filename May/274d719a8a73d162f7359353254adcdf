THE Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, on Monday, disowned a group mobilizing support for his alleged 2023 Presidential ambition. Osinbajo said he has not declared any interest in the 2023 election, noting that he was focused on working in his capacity as Vice President, to address the nation’s challenges. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘2023 permutations a distraction, Osinbajo has not declared interest in presidential race,’ signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande. The statement read in part, “The attention of the Office of the Vice President has been drawn to a website: supportosinbajo.ng that is calling on Nigerians to join a volunteer group mobilizing support for Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, ahead of the 2023 presidential election. “Details of this website and the solicitation of the group are currently trending on WhatsApp with a suggestion that Prof. Osinbajo has ‘quietly’ declared interest in the 2023 election. “The Office of the Vice President is not in any way connected to this website or the group behind it and considers such an enterprise an unnecessary distraction. “Prof. Osinbajo has not declared any interest whatsoever in the 2023 election, but he is rather focused on working in his capacity as Vice President in the current administration to address all the compelling issues in the country and concerns of Nigerians, including finding effective and lasting solutions to the security challenges.” Copyright PUNCH.
