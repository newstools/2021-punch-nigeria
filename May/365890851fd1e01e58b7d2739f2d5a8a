The Bishop of the Ijebu South-West Diocese (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Babatunde Ogunbanwo, has called for synergy among Nigerians to end the country’s myriad of problems. Ogunbanwo spoke on Thursday at a press briefing in Odogbolu, Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State, to herald the diocese’s 2021 synod. The bishop said the agitation for secession was incendiary than problem-solving. He said instead of separation, the agitators should seek justice, which he described as the solution to the country’s problems. He stated, “What we need is justice not division. Division will not bring a solution. What we need is synergy. Nigerians should be proud of being Nigerians. “A situation where we say some people are being favoured above others is unwise. We should learn to live together. Nigeria is our country and we must do everything possible to make sure that peace reigns “Let’s pray for Nigeria. We must be solemn at this time. Let the cries for separation stop. Nigeria needs prayers and everybody must follow God.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
