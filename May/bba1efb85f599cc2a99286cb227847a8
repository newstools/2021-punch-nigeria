Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation has insisted that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo should be allowed to contest for presidency under the platform of the All Progressives Congress. This is coming barely 24 hours after the Office of the Vice President on Monday said Osinbajo has not declared interest to contest for the position of president. The Office in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, also disowned a website and WhatsApp group soliciting and mobilising support for Osinbajo, ahead of the 2023 presidential election. But the Convener of the group, Folusho Ojo ‘Fosh’, said on Tuesday, that whether Osinbajo has shown interest or not to run for the presidency in 2023, “OGO remains solidly committed to its conviction that Osinbajo has all that it takes to lead the country to her promised land. “Yes, he didn’t mandate us to do this. He didn’t commission us to mobilise for him. We are young men and women who believe in him. It is in him we can entrust our future. Therefore and notwithstanding his stand for now, regarding 2023, we shall continue to promote him, we shall continue to let the world know those qualities we have seen in him that have attracted many of us to him. “Considering its spread and acceptability, we, therefore, call on our members across the country to continue to promote the ideas and ideals that Vice President Osibajo stands for. “The youths demand a role model and we have found in him a man we can model our lives after. “It is in Osinbajo we believe and we shall continue to stand by him either now or in the near future, in or out of power, contesting or not contesting.”
