THE All Progressives Congress has charged the new Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya to build on the successes recorded by his predecessors in the fight against insurgents and criminals. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘APC Charges New Chief of Army Staff to consolidate on successes against insurgents, other criminals,’ signed by the party’s National Secretary, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, in Abuja, on Thursday. Akpanudoedehe said the party welcomed the choice of General Farouk as the new Army Chief. The statement read in part, “On behalf of the National Chairman of the Party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, we urge the new Chief of Army Staff to consolidate on the successes recorded by the military in tackling all security threats in the country. “This could be achieved and deepened sustainably through increased collaboration among the security services and communities. More vigilance and increased cooperation and support through sharing information can pave way for faster mopping up of the remnants of the insurgents and ending banditry and kidnapping in parts of the country.” The party said it was satisfied that the President Buhari-led administration has prioritised the provision of more and advanced equipment for the armed forces “which has enhanced their operational capability against elements posing threats to the country’s internal security.”.
