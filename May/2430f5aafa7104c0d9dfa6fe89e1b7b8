Bandits have killed seven persons in Yangalu community in the Magama Local Government Area of Niger State. The bandits were said to have invaded the community on motorcycles and shot indiscriminately to scare away the people. It was gathered that the bandits, before leaving the community, destroyed properties and foodstuffs. The Chairman of the Magama LGA, Sufiyanu Yahaya, visited the community over the development. Yahaya also called for measures that would improve the security situation in the area. Efforts to get police confirmation proved abortive as the command spokesman, Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
