Angry youths in Ojoku and Offa communities in the Oyun and Offa Local Government Areas of Kwara State on Thursday repelled the entry of herdsmen who were migrating from a neighbouring South-West state into the towns. It was gathered that the herdsmen with thousands of cows were sighted by the youths, who mobilised and stopped them from entering the area. It was gathered that the herdsmen were migrating from Iseyin in Oyo State to Lokoja in Kogi State when they were accosted. Similarly, another group of herdsmen who said that they were passing through Ajase-Ipo en route Lokoja in Kogi State were also escorted out of Offa by security agent to prevent attack on them. The Public Relations officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Kwara State Command, Babawale Afolabi, said the leader of the herders, who identified himself as Mohamadu, said they were migrating to Lokoja to join their families. He said that efforts of men and officers of the NSCDC saved the breakdown of law and order in the two communities earlier in the day. Babawale in a statement said, “The NSCDC personnel (arms squad) from Offa accosted them at Igbawere (Offa Local Government Area) and interacted with the Bororo leader, Alhaji Muhammodu, who informed the personnel that they are heading to Lokoja via Ajase-lpo. “All the youth in Ojoku, Igbawere and local hunters were there to see them moving towards their destination.”
