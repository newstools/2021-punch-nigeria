STAKEHOLDERS in Ekiti State and the state government on Tuesday agreed on measures to be put in place to cut government spending as a way of bailing the state out of current economic challenges occasioned by the downturn in global economy. The governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, at the stakeholders’ meeting where he presented the state of the state finances, however, said he would not sack any worker despite the cash crunch facing the state. He, however, added that “if the state must survive the current economic quagmire, there is need to cut over N680m expenses per month.” According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, titled, ‘Ekiti to stop government spending…As Fayemi says no to sacking of workers’, the stakeholders agreed on some cost saving measures to rescue the state. Oyebode stated that the measures included “reduction in subventions to higher institutions in the state, cutting or total stoppage of running grants to offices, and discontinuation of the consequential adjustments of the minimum wage for senior category of workers as well as ramping up of tax collection in a bid to shore up Internally Generated Revenue”. Fayemi said, “We don’t want to sack anyone in Ekiti; these are our people, they are doing their jobs but we cannot continue to manage what we cannot manage.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
