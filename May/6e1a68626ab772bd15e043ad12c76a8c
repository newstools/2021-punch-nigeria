The founder of the One Love Family, Guru Maharaj ji, has commended the southern governors for their decision on the open grazing in the region. A statement on Monday quoted Maharaj ji to have said this while briefing journalists on the events lined up to mark the ‘28th anniversary of  Nigeria as the new holy land of the universe,’ held in the Lagos annex of the spiritual centre. He said, “The ban on open grazing by governors in the southern region is sacrosanct. I urge the governors to go beyond rhetoric and take urgent necessary steps to ensure that exacting law is enacted to that effect, so that our people will finally put behind them the dastardly acts of barbarism which the murderous herders have been visiting on them which have threatened food security in the region. “Hence, a bill outlawing open grazing in their respective states should be drafted either by the executive arm of government or members of the state assemblies for deliberation and passage into law. In the interest of the people and to avoid any legislative bottlenecks, public-spirited individuals can equally draft the bill to avoid any form of delay.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
