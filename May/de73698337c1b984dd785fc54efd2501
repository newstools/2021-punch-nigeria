THE Independent National Electoral Commission, on Thursday, announced plans to convert 753 voting points to polling units in Osun State. It also said it would relocate existing polling units located in palaces, religious centres and private residences to either government institutions or public spaces. The State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, said this while addressing a stakeholders’ meeting on the expansion of voters’ access to polling units held at the INEC headquarters in Osogbo. Agbaje noted that existing polling units in the state were grossly inadequate to cater for the rising population in the state which has led to the establishment of new settlements. He further explained that the commission, after due consultation with stakeholders in the state, embarked on expansion of voter’s access to polling units between April 21 and 29, 2021. He said, “During the exercise, the commission deployed field officers that were earlier trained in the processes involved in the conduct of expanding voter access to polling units including the technical aspects and use of maps generated for the exercise by the commission. “Osun has 3,010 polling units and 753 voting points. The voting points that we have now, we are converting them to polling units in different areas and locations where we believe the people can have access to them. “Polling units will no longer be in front of private houses, palaces and religion institutions. It will be either in front of government institutions or open places where we would put a canopy on the day of election. “Some of these units are right in front of private residences and because of that, we have moved them to areas where we have open space.” Copyright PUNCH.
