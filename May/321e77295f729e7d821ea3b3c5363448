The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare,  has described the Supreme Court judgment nullifying the dissolution of Local Governments in Oyo State as an end to the ‘tyranny’ of Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde. The PUNCH had reported that the Supreme Court on Friday described the dissolution of local governments in Oyo State and their replacement with caretaker committees as illegal. Reacting, Dare said the judgment was a landmark achievement in the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) regime’s  “deliberate hard work to deepen democracy at the grassroots”. The Minister said he was particularly elated that “our party was able to finally lay this issue bothering mainly on the tyranny of power by state governors to rest”. He noted that with the “ unsparing, unequivocal and unambiguous judgment by the highest court in the land, it has now become crystal clear that no state government has the power to sack any elected council chairman or councillor.” He commended the gallantry of the local government chairmen under the leadership of Prince Abass Ayodeji Alesinloye, stressing that their steadfastness and doggedness paid off not only for themselves but for democracy. While congratulating the chairmen and councilors, Dare urged them to remain committed and loyal to the party in order to collectively win back Oyo State for APC.
