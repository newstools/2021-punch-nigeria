WhatsApp has said it won’t delete accounts of users that do not accept its new privacy policy after May 15. The company said this on Monday. In January, the company rolled out a new privacy policy, which dealt mainly with businesses using WhatsApp to send and store consumer text. However, poor communication regarding what the update entailed prompted backlash, as most people thought the company wanted to share their personal data with parent company, Facebook. WhatsApp later delayed this update until the May 15. A statement on the company’s FAQ said, “For the last several weeks, we’ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. “After giving everyone time to review, we’re continuing to remind those who haven’t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After a period of several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.” The company has said that users will encounter limited functionality on the app until they accept the privacy update after May 15. Users won’t have access to their chat lists, but will be able to answer incoming phone and video calls. If notification is enabled, users will be able to tap on them to read or respond to a message or call back a missed voice or video call. After a few weeks of limited functionality, user won’t be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and WhatsApp would stop sending messages and calls to the phone. Copyright PUNCH.
