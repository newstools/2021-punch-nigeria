US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence during his visit to Kiev in a show of support after a massive troop buildup by Russia. “I’m here really for a very simple reason, which is to, on behalf of President Biden, reaffirm — strongly — our commitment to the partnership between our countries, our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence,” he said during the first to Kiev by a senior US official under Biden.
