The Transmission Company of Nigeria, manager of Nigeria’s electricity grid, on Wednesday confirmed the collapse of the country’s power grid and blamed it on a drop in voltage. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the national grid suffered another system collapse, worsening the blackout being experienced in parts of the country. Confirming the development in a statement issued in Abuja, the General Manager, Public Affairs, TCN, Ndidi Mbah, said the company had to immediately commence grid recovery after the collapse which occurred on Wednesday morning. She said the restoration started from a hydro-power generation station in Niger State down to Abuja through Delta to Benin and up to Lagos. Mbah said, “The Transmission Company of Nigeria on hereby states that at about 11.01am today, 12th of May, 2021, there was a total system collapse of the grid, as a result of voltage collapse at some parts of the grid. “TCN commenced grid recovery immediately after the collapse, from Shiroro Generating Station to Katampe TS, Abuja through the Shiroro – Katampe line at 11:29am, and also through Delta Generating Station to Benin Transmission Substation and has reached Osogbo and parts of Lagos.” The TCN spokesperson said while the grid restoration and power restoration gradually progressed to other parts of the country, the cause of voltage collapse that precipitated the failure was equally being investigated. TCN appealed for patience, stressing that it was working assiduously to ensure full restoration of the grid and consequently power supply to the remaining parts of the country. Copyright PUNCH.
