Following the reports of an alleged fresh crisis erupting in Ife and Modakeke communities on Sunday night, May 16, the Osun State police command has debunked the claims. The police spokesperson in the state, Opalola Yemisi, made the clarification in a statement released on Monday, titled, ‘Osun Police debunks report of fresh crisis in Ife/Modakeke – Police’. Yemisi noted that the local vigilantes guiding the area were on their routine show of force to alert the people of the community of their presence and assure them of safety. The statement read, “It has become increasingly necessary to keep you abreast of the incident that occurred in Modakeke last night, 16th May, 2021 and has been trending on social media. “I want to categorically state that, it was an erroneous belief that some people came to attack people from Famia axis. The news was fake and a blatant lie! “The true situation as gathered is that; the local vigilantes guiding the area against thieves and hoodlums were on their routine show of force as any other places, to alert the people of community of their presence and assure them of safety. But because of what happened recently, people became apprehensive, thinking they were under attack.” The statement quoted the Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode, as assuring people of Osun of his “unrelenting commitment to ensure adequate security of the state, which he is overseeing without any fear of attack or molestation”. He, therefore, appealed to everyone to “timely report any strange movement around them or anyone suspected to be of questionable character”.
