Former athletes have backed Annette Echikunwoke to win gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, The PUNCH reports. Echikunwoke became the 11th Nigerian track and field athlete to qualify for the Olympics following her heroics at the Tuscon Classics in Arizona, where she set a personal record – 73.93m. She is currently ranked fifth best hammer thrower in the US after four Americans DeAnna Price, Brooke Anderson, Been Berry and Janee Kasannavoid. According to former sprinter and Olympic silver medallist, Fatima Yusuf-Olukoju, Echikunwoke’s emergence boosted Nigeria’s medal hopes. “She has a good chance of making a podium finish at the Olympics as she’s doing well. She just needs to be consistent.” Retired hurdler  Gloria Alozie said,  “All the athletes who have qualified are all medal hopefuls. I just hope she gets into form at the right time. Annette is good enough for the podium.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
