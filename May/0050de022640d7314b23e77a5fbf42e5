THE Indigenous People of Biafra on Tuesday said this year’s sit-at-home would hold on Monday, May 31, 2021, and not Sunday, May 30, 2021, as it earlier announced. The modification, according to IPOB, was due to genuine observations about its earlier directive, “as many of our people observe Sundays as a day of worship”. It, however, added that all commercial activities would be shut down on May 31, 2021, throughout Biafra land. The group stated this in a statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH on Tuesday morning. The statement read in part, “We, the Indigenous People of Biafra, ably led by our great and indomitable leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to announce that this year’s Biafra Remembrance Day sit-at-home will now hold on Monday, May 31, and not Sunday, May 30 as earlier directed. “The modification is following genuine observations about our earlier directive as many of our people observe Sunday as a day of worship. There will be partial observation of the Biafra Day on May 30th. But there will be a total lockdown and sit-at-home on Monday, 31st of May. “There should be no vehicular movement on that day on Biafra roads. Transport companies must withdraw from the road on that day. National Union of Road Transport Workers; National Associations of Road Transport Owners; and others are expected to fully comply with this directive. “In the same vein, artisans and traders must close shop on that day. Airports, seaports, banks and financial institutions should all shut down in honour of our fallen heroes and heroines.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
