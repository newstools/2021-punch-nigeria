Kuda Technologies has said its Nigerian subsidiary, Kuda Microfinance Bank – has acquired over one million customers. It disclosed this in a statement titled ‘Africa-focused challenger bank Kuda passes one million customers’ on Tuesday. To mark the milestone, the statement said, the Chief Executive Officer, Kuda, Babs Ogundeyi, and CTO, Musty Mustapha presented the bank’s one millionth customer, Mr Abiola Jewoola, a gift of one million naira at its Lagos office. The London-headquartered startup, which launched in Nigeria in 2019 and operates under a microfinance banking licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria, had witnessed significant growth since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it stated. This was as it had firmly positioned itself as a safe alternative to brick-and-mortar banks at a time when the significant risk of infection made visiting banking halls a challenging experience. It stated that Kuda’s strong digital offering was appealing to Nigerian millennials and that many who were inseparable from their connected smartphones, had been attracted by the bank’s proposition of zero fees on cards. Other attractions were that account maintenance and transfers had helped it make headway in Nigeria’s highly competitive retail banking market which was dominated by traditional incumbents. “Our growth in Nigeria is remarkable no doubt but more importantly, it is an indication of what we can achieve in other markets across the world,” Ogundeyi said. Kuda said it was set on reaching all Africans on the planet, adding that the core target of its mission was to make banking services affordable, accessible and rewarding. Copyright PUNCH.
