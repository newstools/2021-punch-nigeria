THE family of an 18-year-old girl, Mariam Rauf, has called on security agencies to unravel the mystery behind the disappearance of the teenager. Mariam, a resident of Oke Baale area of Osogbo, Osun State, was last seen on Monday, March 29, when she left home for school and had not been found since then. However, the mother of the missing teenager, Bukola Ayeni, accused a cleric, Ola John, who had taken partial custody of the girl before her disappearance, of lack of concern since the girl went missing. Speaking with newsmen in Osogbo on Tuesday, Ayeni explained that her daughter was sleeping in a church pastored by John since 2019 to cure her of bedwetting. She said, “After I had narrated the situation to Pastor John, he advised me to allow her to be sleeping in the church.” “Early this year, my husband suggested Mariam return home. On two occasions, my daughter suddenly went into trance. That development made us to send her back to church.” Ayeni, who said since the girl went missing nothing serious was heard about the matter. But Pastor John said he made several efforts to locate the teenager but was informed by one of her friends that Mariam was somewhere in the South-East selling herbal products. Copyright PUNCH.
