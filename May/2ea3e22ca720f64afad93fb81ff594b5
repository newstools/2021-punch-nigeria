Thomas Mueller will be recalled by Germany for the Euro 2020 after more than two years out of the squad, a report said on Monday. The 31-year-old Bayern Munich forward will be a part of coach Joachim Loew’s 26-strong group which will be named on Wednesday, the Bild newspaper in Germany said. Mueller, a FIFA World Cup winner in 2014, earned the last of his 100 caps against the Netherlands in a November 2018 Nations League game. Four months later he, along with Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, was dropped by Loew who said he wanted to focus on building for the future. But Loew has now brought Mueller back into the fold as he looks to end his 15-year reign as national coach on a high before stepping down after the Euros. The decision to exclude Mueller drew frequent criticism as Loew struggled to refresh the side after a group stage exit from the 2018 World Cup in Russia. While Germany again struggled in the 2020 Nations League —- which ended in a 6-0 loss in Spain which almost cost Loew his job —- Mueller was a key part of Bayern Munich winning the treble. A combination of Mueller’s form, difficulties in developing younger players and simple short-term expediency have led to the recall Loew himself hinted of last week. “We have checked and analysed again everything that was possible,” Loew said of his choices about the Euro 2020 squad. Mueller, meanwhile, is willing to come back. “I’m eager to hunt titles in the summer,” he said recently. Germany play all their Euros group games in Munich where they take on World Cup holders France (June 15), title-holders Portugal (June 19), and Hungary (June 23). Mueller’s return will likely come before those matches in his home stadium in tune-up clashes with Denmark on June 2 and Latvia five days later. (dpa/NAN)
