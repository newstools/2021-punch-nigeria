A Senior Manager in the Global Compliance and Reporting Team of EY Nigeria, Mr Olaoluwa Ogunniyi, has said withholding tax helps to bring prospective taxpayers into the tax net. He said this during a webinar organised by the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, with the theme ‘The challenges of utilising WTH credit notes: Stakeholders perspective for a more efficient tax administration’. The webinar was attended by different professionals in the financial sector. “The main purpose of withholding tax is to bring prospective taxpayers into the tax net, thereby widening the income tax base,” he said. According to Ogunniyi also, withholding tax is more likely a collection machinery to curb tax evasion and not a separate tax on its own. Explaining further, he said withholding tax is an advance payment of income tax deducted at source on qualifying transactions. He said, “It is payment on account of the ultimate income tax liability of a taxpayer. It may also represent the final tax liability on certain passive incomes.” According to him, it can be utilised as a credit against the beneficiaries’ income tax liability for the relevant years.
