Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, has said that God will not allow a failure to succeed him in the forthcoming elections. The Governor made this known on Saturday while delivering a statement titled, ‘God is doing a new thing in Akwa Ibom State’, at the occasion of the sixth anniversary of his inauguration as Akwa Ibom State Governor. According to the Governor, the issue of his successor has “driven everyone in the state to a near frenzy.” Addressing the issue, he pointed out that God will not allow a failure to succeed him. He said, “My dear Akwa Ibomites, if what you are desiring is a successor who will not have the capacity and the discipline to build a state where you and your children will live in peace and strive to excel, if you are desiring a successor who will turn back the clock of our developmental strides, if you are desiring a successor who will bring out the worst in our youths as opposed to galvanising their energies and challenging them to be the best they can be, if you are desiring a leader who would not efficiently utilise the resources of this state on projects that have redeeming value, then I am sorry to disappoint you, God will not give us such a successor.”
