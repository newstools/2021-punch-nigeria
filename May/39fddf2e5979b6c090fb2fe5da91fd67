Dual Luxury World, a company that specialises in providing citizenship and permanent residency for high-net-worth individuals has expanded to a new office space. A statement from the company said the new office which opened in April was launched to boost the company’s operations given its business growth. The expansion was attributed to its partnership with RIF Trust, a Dubai based company that offered citizenship through investment programs. Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dual Luxury World, Faramola Adegunle, stated that the move was to better serve its growing client base. He said, “Service excellence is extremely important to us as a service business. Our effort to deliver quality and satisfactory solutions has increased as we have in turn experienced exponential growth in our customer base. “It became imperative for us to move into an office that would not only comfortably accommodate our people, but more importantly, enable us build more convenient service experiences for our customers. It also affords us convenience in conducting business with our trusted partners.” Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, Tosin Arobieke, said “It had become imperative for us to acquire a more conducive office, particularly with the increase in our customer base following our strategic partnership.” “With the partnership, we have consolidated our capacity to tailor bespoke citizenship and permanent residency solutions to our customers. The new office also helps us better serve the need of our clients.” The company promised to combine innovative solutions using global reach and a transparent approach to provide world-class service.
