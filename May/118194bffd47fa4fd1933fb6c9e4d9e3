The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has charged men of the Federal Fire Service not to handle the lives and properties of Nigerians with levity. He said there was the need to step up their games in their responses to emergencies across the country. Aregbesola was quoted to have said this in a statement by the Federal Fire Service, Director Press and Public Relations, Ozokwelu Nonye, while decorating 157 newly-promoted officers of the service at its headquarters in Abuja. He was represented at the event by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr. Shuaib Belgore . He said, “You must step up your performance and ensure as much as possible, to step down response time to emergency calls and as well, have the right attitude to grow the service so that the public will recognize how important and effective you are, because, to whom much is given, much is expected.” He added that being worthy of promotion was just the first step, earning the confidence the people have in them is very necessary. He noted further that, the most important duties of the service was not only putting out fire which is what most people think but rescuing and saving lives and property of citizens. Earlier in his remarks, the Controller General of the Federal Fire Service, Dr. Liman Alhaji Ibrahim appreciated the efforts of the Minister and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Interior by ensuring that the service is being positively reformed. Among the 157 officers promoted were four Deputy Controller Generals, 14 Assistant Controller Generals, nine  Controllers, 11 Deputy Controllers, and 26 Assistant Controllers. Also, an officer who was also to be decorated died before the event
