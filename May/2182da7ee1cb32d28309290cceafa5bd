The Association of Local Government of Nigeria, Oyo State Chapter, has dedicated its victory at the Supreme Court to the late former Governor Abiola Ajimobi. ALGON Chairman, Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye, made the dedication at a news conference on Saturday in Ibadan. He said that Ajimobi was instrumental to the victory through his support for ALGON. He said that the late Ajimobi taught ALGON to thread the legal path to justice even in the face of intimidation and harassment. “I have the mandate of my colleagues to say that as sweet as this victory is, we regret that our leader, in the person of Senator Abiola Ajimobi, is not around to witness this day. “We have, however, decided to dedicate this victory to the loving memory of Senator Abiola Ajimobi because he taught us to follow rule of law even in the face of intimidation and harassment,” he said. He expressed appreciation to all those who contributed to the victory, saying their efforts laid a strong foundation for democracy to thrive at the grassroots. “What we are fighting for is not about the office. It is about laying a good precedence for others who will occupy those offices later. “It is about the rule of law. It is about democracy to thrive at the grassroots. “This is what we have been fighting for, this is what we will continue to fight for and this is what we appreciate in the judgment,” he said. The ALGON boss said the Supreme Court also ordered that all the sacked council chairmen and councillors should receive their full salaries and allowances up till March 2022. Abass-Aleshinloye added that all the elected chairmen and councillors from the 33 local governments and 35 local council development areas would benefit from the judgment. (NAN)
