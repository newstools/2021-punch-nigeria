Two Nigerian schools have produced the first six African internationally Modern Classroom Certified Teachers.  The schools, Great Height Academy and Start Rite Schools, are based in Abuja. The schools benefited from New Horizons’ scholarship for teachers on MCCT training and international certification. The training is available to New Horizons partner schools in Nigeria and across the 80 countries, according to a statement issued on Monday by New Horizons. Head of School, Start-Rite, Mrs Christiana Ekamen, was quoted to have said, “MCCT training was very impressive, and is in line with the school’s online policy and would help teachers to better manage the special technical challenges of the modern classroom most especially in this post-COVID era.” MCCT teachers are equipped with skills on how to use modern technologies to impart knowledge to their students while teaching online, the statement said. It added that MCCT was necessary and critical for all teachers in primary, secondary, and universities, as it allowed them to have a great background in remote teaching. On the other hand, Director of Great Height Academy, Hajiya Rabi Namtari was quoted to have said, “The course material for MCCT is excellent for anyone interested in teaching in any online format.” New Horizons Nigeria, MD/CEO, Mr Tim Akano, congratulated the board, management and staff of the schools.
