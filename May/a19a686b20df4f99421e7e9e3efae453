CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, hinted that Tesla was considering dogecoin to replace bitcoin as a payment option. In a tweet, he said, “Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.” Last week, Musk had announced that Tesla was no longer going to accept bitcoin as a payment option again. The crypto market thanked, with bitcoin shedding over 10 per cent of its values in 24 hours. In a subsequent tweet, Musk said, “To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal.” To observers of Musk, it came as no surprise. In April, Musk had dubbed himself as the ‘Dogefather’, causing the value of dogecoin to soar. Also, Coinbase announced that it was planning to list dogecoin on its exchange within the next six to eight weeks. Coinbase CFO, Alesia Hass revealed this on CNBC’s Mad Money show when he was asked: “Should investors take Dogecoin seriously?” “We are a platform. We want to offer all assets that meet our listing standards and we hope to be the place where you can come and trade anything that you want to trade,” he said.
