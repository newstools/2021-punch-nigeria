The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Wednesday ruled out accommodating Delta State in the spending of £4.2 million recovered looted funds associated with the family members of a former governor of the state, James Ibori. He said Nigeria would deviate from the agreement reached with the United Kingdom government concerning the disbursement of the fund. He said this while answering questions during a Channels Television programme, Politics Today. Recall that The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Federal Government confirmed receipt of £4,214,017.66 of the loot associated with the family members  Ibori. During the programme, Malami listed the projects the money would be spent on according to the agreement reached. He said the government would deviate from the agreement. The minister said, “The way international diplomatic processes operate with particular regard to the recovery of looted asset is more or less about engagement among the nations of interest.” Copyright PUNCH.
