The  Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, on Thursday said efforts were ongoing to revive the nation’s steel industry. This, he said, was apart from government’s efforts to promote industrialisation. According to a statement signed by Otuyemi Adetayo on behalf of the ministry’s Deputy Director/ Head Press and Public Relations, the minister spoke in Abuja at the inauguration of the  Committees on Drafting of National Policy on Welding and Related Fields and National Status Survey on Welding and Related Fields. “In addition to the desire of the government to promote rapid industrialisation, serious efforts are ongoing to revive the steel Industry in the country, because of the vital role steel plays in both welding activities and overall economic development,” Onu was quoted as saying. The minister also highlighted government’s recognition of the significance of welding to the economy. On capital flight and unemployment, he said, “These policies will among many other things keep Nigerian jobs for Nigerians and reduce capital flight arising from the importation of skilled personnel.” Copyright PUNCH.
