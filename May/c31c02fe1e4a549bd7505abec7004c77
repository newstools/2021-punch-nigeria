THE only student of Abia State University, Uturu, still left in the custody of a criminal gang that abducted some persons travelling along the Okigwe-Uturu Road, has been released. Governor Okezie Ikpeazu made this known on Sunday via his official Twitter handle, @GovernorIkpeazu. “It is with exceedingly great joy and a very pleasant sense of relief that I announce that the only kidnapped ABSU student who was still in the custody of the hoodlums that abducted some people a few days ago along the Okigwe-Uturu Road has been freed. “Our administration has since taken measures to strengthen the security around the area where the incident happened, and even beyond it, ensure the security of lives and property which remains my number one assignment as governor and it is one duty I will never take lightly. “We will surely take justice to those who abducted our students as we will not cohabit this state with criminals,” the governor tweeted.
