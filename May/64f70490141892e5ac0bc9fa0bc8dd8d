The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals, Princess Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, has appealed for calm ahead of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress for the Lagos council election scheduled for Saturday, July 29. Orelope-Adefulire, a former deputy governor of Lagos, in a statement on Friday urged contestants in the primary to shun every form of violence to have the peaceful atmosphere needed for the conduct of the election. She appealed to the contestants for the chairmanship and councillorship positions in the Alimosho and other local government areas to ensure the contest does not degenerate into violence and bloodbath. She said, “The primary election should not be a do-or-die affair for anyone, especially if the intention is to genuinely serve the people. We must do everything possible to avoid bloodshed. “We must continue to ensure that peace continues to reign in Lagos so that we can continue to enjoy and take advantage of the numerous achievements of our amiable Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.” Orelope-Adefulire noted that the country was already facing several security challenges, urging that anything that could compound the situation and further put stress on the security operatives should be avoided. She also appealed to those presiding over the primary to ensure that the process is free, fair, and transparent so that the results would be acceptable to all. “Lagos remains one of the most peaceful states in the country and we should not do anything to change this enviable status of the state. I wish all contestants and members of our party across the state a successful and peaceful election,” she said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
