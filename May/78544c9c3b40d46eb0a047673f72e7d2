Former Enyimba striker Victor Ezeji has berated the management and players of the Aba side after their exit from the CAF Confederation Cup. Enyimba were knocked out of the Confederation Cup by Egyptian side Pyramids 5-2 on aggregate. The two-time African champions lost the first leg 4-1 in Cairo, before playing out a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in Aba on Sunday. Speaking with The PUNCH, Ezeji, who won the 2003 CAF Champions League with Enyimba, said some of the players had no business at the club. “Enyimba have not been too convincing in the CAF Confederation Cup, after they dropped from the CAF Champions League,” Ezeji said. “Everything about the club, from the players to the management, is wrong, especially this season. “Look at the way they play away from home, their defence line is very poor. So, why won’t they concede goals like they did against Pyramids? “The club’s management did not help matters because issues that they needed to look into, like logistics, transportation and others were left till the last minute. “Pyramids flew from Egypt to Port Harcourt on Thursday for a game that would be played on Sunday. In the case of Enyimba, everything would be done in the last minute and this is one of the major reasons that they were knocked out of the completion because they did not plan well.” Copyright PUNCH.
