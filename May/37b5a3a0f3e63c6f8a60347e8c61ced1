Barely 24 hours after she was kidnapped by gunmen, Prof Grace Ayanbimpe of the University of Jos, and her husband, Isaac, have regained their freedom. The don and her husband were kidnapped by gunmen on Monday from their residence behind the Haske Quarters, Lamingo, in the Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. It was learnt that the gunmen made contact with the family shortly after the abduction and demanded N15m ransom. The victims were said to have been rescued by the police, local hunters and vigilantes. A family member, who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, however, said, “We were able to raise a ransom and pay before the professor and her husband were released.” The family member, however, did not disclose the amount paid as ransom to the kidnappers. The source added, “They (the couple) are currently receiving treatment and we believe that they will be fine soon. We want to thank everyone for their show of love and concern through phone calls, text messages and visits. Words cannot express how grateful we are. May God bless and reward each of you immensely and may none of you see such evil in Jesus name.” But the spokesman for the state police command, Ubah Ogaba, denied knowledge of ransom payment to the kidnappers, saying, “What I know is what I have sent to you earlier. Thank you.” Ogaba had earlier said the victims  were rescued by a joint team of security agents, hunters and vigilantes. “With the concerted effort of the  police Tactical Team, Plateau State Command, hunters and vigilantes, the kidnapped victims, Prof Grace Ayanbimpe, and her husband, Mr Isaac Ayanbimpe, were released unhurt,” the police spokesman stated.
