The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration is committed to developing the creative industry in order for Lagos to remain the destination for art, music and other talents.
Sanwo-Olu spoke on Monday while receiving the Nigerian online comedy group, ‘Ikorodu Bois’, at the Lagos House, Marina.
“Lagos is proud of the Ikorodu Bois because their creativity has put Ikorodu on the global map of international entertainment platforms,” the governor said.
Ikorodu Bois rose to fame for recreating and mimicking multi-million dollar music videos, Hollywood movie trailers, movie scenes and epic pictures using ordinary household items.
The group comprises three siblings: Babatunde Sanni, Muiz Sanni, Malik Sanni, and their cousin, Fawas Aina. Sanwo-Olu, who was excited by the creativity of the young boys, promised to support and provide a platform for them to achieve their dreams.
