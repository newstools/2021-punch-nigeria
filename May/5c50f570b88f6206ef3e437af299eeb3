The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission to track down Gimba Yau Kumo, son-in-law to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who is allegedly involved in a $65 million fraud. The party made this call in a statement titled, ‘$65m fraud: Track down Buhari’s son in-law, PDP charges ICPC’, released on Friday, and signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Commission declared Kumo, Tarry Rufus, and Bola Ogunsola, wanted in relation to a $65 million fraud in the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria. According to PDP, this fraud involving the President’s son-in-law is an implication on the “Buhari Presidency.” The statement read, “The party charges the ICPC not to succumb to reported pressure from the cabal in the Buhari Presidency but to track down Yau Kumo, the former Managing Director of the FMBN,who had already been declared wanted, and bring him to book alongside his accomplices. “It speaks volumes that the Buhari Presidency had remained silent in the face of this huge fraud involving Mr. President’s son-in-law; a beneficiary of the primitive family patronage in the Buhari administration, only for certain members of the cabal to be reportedly mounting pressure on the ICPC to let him off the hook. “The PDP holds as wicked, afflicting and provocative that while millions of hardworking Nigerians cannot afford their daily meals and other basic necessities of life due to the misrule and corruption of the All Progressives Congress and its administration, they are daily assailed by revelations of unbridled treasury looting under President Buhari’s watch.” “The PDP urges the Buhari Presidency to allow for an open investigation of Mr. President’s son-in-law as well as those fingered in the fraud in the NPA(Nigerian Ports Authority) and the NDDC (Niger Delta Development Commission),” the statement concluded.
