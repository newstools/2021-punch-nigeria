Two people were feared dead in Ikire, Osun State, as members of Oodua Peoples Congress and Oodua Peoples Congress Initiative reportedly clashed. Sources in Ikire, who preferred anonymity, had told The PUNCH on Thursday that the crisis started in the town on Tuesday when a member of OPC was shot him dead. Osun OPC coordinator, Deji Aladesawe, in a chat told our correspondent that a member of OPC called Olayode was shot dead, despite the intervention of Akire in Council, who had earlier brokered peace between the two factions. Asked if the deceased member of OPCI was killed by OPC men in retaliation, Aladesawe, who denied the involvement of his men in the death of the rival group member, identified as Wasiu, said the security situation in the town was under control. He said, “The suspect involved in the killing of the OPC member called him out from his place of work and shot him dead. The name of our member that was killed is Olayode. A member of OPCI was also killed in the clashes that followed the first killing. His name is Wasiu. “Police should investigate and apprehend all trouble makers.” Meanwhile, the unrest in the town paralysed business activities on Thursday, as streets were deserted, while many businesses were also shut by their operators. A large number of riot policemen were also stationed at flashpoints in the town. However, Special Adviser to Osun State Governor on Security, Abiodun Ige, told our correspondent that the police were working to ensure peace, adding that normalcy had returned to the community. Osun Police Command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, when contacted, confirmed that there was unrest in the town, but requested more time to get facts of the matter.
