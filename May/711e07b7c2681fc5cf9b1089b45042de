The Senate on Tuesday asked the Federal Government to review its policy which made it compulsory for prospective candidates wishing to write examinations being conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board to obtain the National Identification Number. The Senate resolution followed the adoption of a motion moved on the issue by Senator Ifeanyi Ubah at plenary. The red chamber, specifically, urged the Federal Ministry of Education, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, and the National Identity Management Commission to review the implementation of the policy. The Senate noted that the review of the policy was with a view to extending the JAMB registration deadline and requirements until there is a seamless and well-organised process for obtaining the NIN. The Senate also urged the Federal Ministry of Education and NIMC to introduce and streamline a simple and decentralised NIN registration process. The upper chamber said students should be able to obtain their NIN in their various accredited schoolâ€™s premises. JAMB had earlier extended registration for the annual Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination till Saturday, May 29.
