The Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law has urged the Federal Government to invest in ranching in the country. The association stated this during its annual conference at Jogor Centre, Ibadan, Oyo State. A statement said the theme of the conference, which began on Sunday and ended on Wednesday, was, ‘The Role of Public Interest in Governance in Nigeria’. There were lead presentations from eminent speakers, senior members of the bar, the political class, critical stakeholders and other renowned jurists. SPIDEL said it viewed with concern the frequent bloodletting in the clashes of farmers and herdsmen, adding that it recognised the need for an urgent intervention to stop the situation. The group noted that while it approved the ban on open grazing by some states in the country, other states must institute laws in order to preserve lives. It also urged the Federal Government to invest in and institutionalise ranching in the country. Other issues such as paternity fraud, abuse of human rights and gender-based violence were discussed and solutions proffered. While addressing the issue of financial autonomy of the judiciary, SPIDEL called on state governors to enforce judicial autonomy in their states and ensure financial independence of the judiciary and legislature, in order to ensure that the judiciary delivered justice to the poor and oppressed without fear or favour.
