Ex-Super Eagles coach, Adegboye Onigbinde, on Wednesday, said those saddled with the responsibility of developing sports were not doing enough to take it to the next level. Onigbinde, who spoke in Osogbo, the Osun State capital after he was unveiled as the Brand Ambassador of the Osun State College of Technology’s Academy of Science and Sports, Esa Oke, said there should be deliberate and sustained plans to develop sports in the country. “To be able to identify talents, we must set up a body that will analyse all competitions in the country and stop playing football for fun. “In the FIFA Statutes, Article 2, the objective for running football, the opening sentence, which makes it the most important objective, says ‘to improve the game of football constantly.’ We are not developing anything in this country.
If we are organising competitions, lets train some people as technical analysts, assign them to every league match in this country. “Do we have a programme for developing our sportsmen in this area? There is no deliberate developmental programme for our sports, particularly football.” In his remarks, OSCOTECH Rector Dr. Samson Adegoke explained that the institution would be a co-educational secondary school and would pay attention to five sports namely football, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, and badminton.
