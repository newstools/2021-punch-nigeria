A diaspora Igbo group, the Igbo World Assembly, has condemned the continued labelling of the Indigenous People of Biafra as a terrorist group by the Federal Government. It also urged Igbo town unions, vigilantes, including Ebube Agu and Eastern Security Network, to work together for the security of the Igbo communities, The group in a statement on Sunday observed that while the herdsmen, who had been killing innocent people had been pampered by government, IPOB members had been hounded like criminals. IWA in the statement jointly signed by its Chairman, Dr Nwachukwu Anakwenze; Vice Chairman, Christian Onuorah, and Secretary General, Oliver Nwankor, noted that government had spared herdsmen that were the real killers, murderers, kidnappers and rapists in the society. “We, the Diaspora Igbo group, the Igbo World Assembly, IWA, have condemned in the strongest terms the Federal Government posture in labelling the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a terrorist organisation. “These Fulani herdsmen terrorists, who are the real terrorists, are treated with kid gloves by the government while turning around to hound IPOB members who, as far as we are concerned, are not terrorists, but are freedom fighters agitating for a better deal for their people,” IWA said. Expressing discomfort at the worsening security situation in the South-East and Nigeria, the group in the statement urged all the towns in all Igbo communities to set up a vigorous and robust vigilantes’ outfit to guard every part of the state.
