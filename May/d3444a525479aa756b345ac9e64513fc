Revenue-generating ministries, departments and agencies in Cross River State which fail to meet their revenue targets will have their salaries withheld henceforth. The Auditor-General and Acting Chairman of the Cross River State Internal Revenue Service, John Odey, disclosed this at a meeting with representatives of the MDAs in Calabar. According to him, the measure became imperative given the alleged lackadaisical attitude of some MDAs concerning revenue generation. He lamented the dwindling shortfall in revenue, describing it as “unacceptable as the government now relies heavily on internally generated revenue to meet its financial obligations, especially payment of salaries.” “The essence of the meeting is to identify reasons for the dwindling revenue as well as rub minds on possible solutions to revenue increase in the state,” he added. Odey said the decision to put salaries of defaulting MDAs on hold was not meant to make people suffer, but put people on their toes “so they could do the needful.” Responding, some of the workers promised to redouble their efforts, but called on the government to address some of the challenges affecting their revenue generation. They listed some of the challenges as non-payment of imprest, activities of illegal revenue collectors, illegal ceding of some government-owned cocoa plantations, and absence of functional X-Ray machines in some government hospitals.
