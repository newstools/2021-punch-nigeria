THE Pan Niger Delta Forum has called on the Federal Government to demonstrate sincerity in tackling insecurity in the country. PANDEF said this was necessary in order to prove the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, wrong in his allegations that there was bias in the operations of the military. Recall that Kanu had petitioned the President of the United States, Joe Biden, and among other requests, asked the US not to sell weapons to Nigeria. Kanu had in his petition alleged that Nigeria security forces were persecuting Christians, Jews and Nigeria’s indigenous people. But PANDEF spokesman, Ken Robinson, told The PUNCH in a telephone interview on Monday that though the forum was not in support of the request that the US should not sell weapons to Nigeria, the Federal Government had not been dispassionate in the discharge of its responsibilities. Robinson said, “There is some sense in the accusations made by Nnamdi Kanu that there is bias in the operations of the military. We’re also aware that repentant Boko Haram members are being reportedly recruited into the military. “These are issues that cannot be taken lightly. That does not support the fact that the country should be denied military support. The Federal Government should demonstrate sincerity and fairness to prove that the allegations made by Nnamdi Kanu are untrue.” He, however, warned that Nigeria could experience anarchy if the police and military continued to handle insecurity in such ways. “If the police and the military continue this way, the country may descend into total anarchy. The military in some areas don’t even obey the directives of the government,” Robinson added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
