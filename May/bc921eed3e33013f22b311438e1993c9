The Federal Government has declared Wednesday and Thursday as public holidays to mark the 2021 Eid-ul-Fitr celebration. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government on Monday. A statement by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, Dr. Shuaib Belgore, quoted Aregbesola as congratulating the Muslim faithful on the occasion. He also called “all Nigerians, at home and abroad to use the period of this year’s Eidul-Fitr celebration to pray for peace, stability and economic transformation in the land”. Aregbesola, who believes that development cannot thrive in a rancorous atmosphere, urged all “Nigerians to be law-abiding and embrace the spirit of love, self-discipline, kindness, and tolerance, as taught by the Holy Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him)”. The minister also called on all security agencies in the country to “be more courageous and patriotic to surmount the ongoing battle against resurging insecurity and activities of criminal elements in Nigeria”. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, and the holiday begins according to the sighting of the new moon.
