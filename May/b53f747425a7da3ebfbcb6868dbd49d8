A former presidential candidate of the Peoples Trust, in the 2019 election, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has urged stakeholders, especially political leaders, to unite in order to save Nigeria from imminent collapse. Olawepo-Hashim, said this in a statement in Lagos, on Tuesday. He said, “The nation is on fire and we must put it out right now! Nigeria’s political leaders across political lines in government and out of government must urgently arrive at a consensus to secure the country and return it to a path of peace and unity so as to give hope to the citizens who desperately need to be assured that their fatherland can still work for them. “The challenges confronting Nigeria are larger than any particular party in government or in opposition, they are bigger than any group’s interest or ambition, they require the goodwill of all patriots to resolve, and our best collective wisdom as a people. “On our part we recommended that we establish a defence co-operation agreement with a friendly nation to halt the enemy’s advance; we must put our house in order by resolving internal wrangling through dialogue, fairness, and justice; we must have a broad-based cabinet that can inspire hope, efficiency, and national unity.” Copyright PUNCH.
