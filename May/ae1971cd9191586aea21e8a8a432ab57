Ex-Governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba, on Wednesday, warned Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, to weigh his words carefully so as not contradict the position of his principal, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as well as the stance of the ruling All Progressives Congress on national issues.

He was reacting to statements made by  Shehu faulting open grazing ban by Southern Governors. Shehu had lambasted the governors, saying the ban was of questionable legality but APC leaders in the South-West gathered in Lagos last Sunday and backed the Southern governors’ open grazing ban. Osoba also lamented that members of the APC are not speaking with one voice on the herders’ crisis in the country. The elder statesman said, “We the elders of the party are talking to ourselves already. A situation where we in the same government, in the same party, are singing discordant tunes is not helpful at all, we are not helping this country. “The governors are members of the APC and Garba Shehu was a former President of the Nigerian Guild of Editors, a well-grounded professional. I will counsel that he has to come back to this profession and weigh his words and be careful in terms of interventions. We are one government but we are the ones acting as opposition to ourselves. “In the first place, Federal Government has no inch of land in Nigeria other than the Federal Capital Territory. The constitution vested the Land Use Decree in the governors and the governors are saying we are in control of our area. They must listen to the feelings of their people. “In a federation, what is good for us here might not be good for others.”
