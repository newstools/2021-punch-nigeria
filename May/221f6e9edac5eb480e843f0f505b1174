THE Abia State chapter of the All Progressive Congress, has asked Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to explain to citizens and residents of the state the kind of commissioners he has appointed. In a statement by the State Publicity Secretary of the APC, Benedict Godson, the party said, “It is also meant to remind him that Abia is not a hamlet he can administer as he feels, a hamlet where anyone can govern anyhow.” “As Nigerian citizens, as Abians, as a party and as humans, we want to use this medium to remind Gov Okezie Ikpeazu that it is now four months since he started running Abia affairs without commissioners. “Everyone in Nigeria is aware that Gov Ikpeazu dissolved the Abia State Executive Council in January, retaining only the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Commissioner for Information and the Commissioner for Health. “This decision of the governor to dissolve the Executive council retaining only three Commissioners was widely reported. It actually means that about 23 commissioners were removed making such positions vacant in January 2021.” The statement further stated “How can this be? Majority of them are meant to execute all what’s approved for their ministries in the 2021 Budget. They made input on how those ministries will be run this year, why are we derailing from how the government should operate? Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
