The Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Prof. Felix Salako, has expressed regret that the suspension of management courses at the institution has left many lecturers jobless. Salako expressed the regret during the naming of some legacy projects on the campus of the institution. The four projects – library extension building, agric complex, COLPLANT building and central laboratory building – were facilitated by the Federal Government, according to Salako. Salako complained that several appeals had been made to the Federal Government to restore the management courses but no positive response had followed the appeals. Recall that Federal Government had in 2017 directed all specialised universities in the country to suspend running of programmes that were unrelated to their mandates. Salako noted that the management courses were important to agricultural studies, adding that the courses would bring about logistics support like making money through value addition. He said “If we really want to practise agric for commercials purpose, we need management sciences. This concept of agric is not just production of crops, agric has become a business. This is the way it’s being practised in developing nation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
