No fewer than two persons were feared killed on Thursday as suspected armed robbers attacked a billion van at Elemosho village along Akure-Ondo Expressway in the Ondo East Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the robbers waylaid and attacked the bullion van, belonging to a commercial bank, which was heading for Akure, the state capital, around 5pm and made away with an undisclosed sum of money. An eyewitness said the operation lasted for about 20 minutes, after which the robbers shot three persons before escaping into the bush. It was gathered that the robbers carried out the operation with interference from the security operatives. He said, “The robbers came to the scene in a Lexus car and waylaid the convoy of the bullion van. They rained bullets on two out of the three vehicles in the convoy. They shot three people before they ran away. One of the victims survived, but it was not sure whether the other two survived it.” It was gathered that men of the Ondo State Security Network Agency, Amotekun, took one of the victims to hospital. The Commander of Amotekun, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, confirmed the incident, adding that there was no life lost in the attack. Adeleye said, “When we got the information, my men moved in there and met one of the persons that were shot; we have taken him to hospital.” Also, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, said the command had commenced investigation into the incident with the aim of arresting the hoodlums.
