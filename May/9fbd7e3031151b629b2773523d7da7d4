Twenty-six-year-old Udochukwu Simeon has been arrested for allegedly cloning the email addresses of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and using the same to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. According to the EFCC, the suspect created an Outlook email account of the anti-graft agency, efccnigeria.org.ng@outlook.com and webmail, info@efcc-nigeria.org.ng, which he used to impersonate the commission. The Head of Media and Publicity of the agency, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement on Wednesday, said an investigation by the cybercrime unit of the commission indicated that the suspect also used the two fake e-mail accounts to send messages to his victims, while posing as an officer of the commission trying to help the victims recover their stolen funds. He added that Simeon, before his arrest, had received over $3,000 from some of his victims. Uwujaren, who noted that Simeonâ€™s activities amount to forgery, identity theft, impersonation and cyber-squatting, said he would be charged upon the completion of investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
