Suspected Fulani herders on Saturday allegedly killed three teenagers in Yelwata community, in the Guma Local Government Area of Benue State. The killings, which sparked off protest by the youth, also led to the shooting of a young man by security operatives, who were dispersing the protesters. Our correspondent gathered that the teenagers had gone to their farm and were working when the herdsmen allegedly stormed the area and killed the three brothers and then disappeared into thin air. The incident was said to have angered the youth in the area, who recovered the corpses and used them to block the Makurdi-Lafia highway for several hours. Efforts by the combined military, police and other security agencies to get the angry youths off the road were said to have been rebuffed, which caused heavy gridlock on the highway. The Chairman of Guma LGA, Caleb Abah, who confirmed the killings, said the fourth victim died after security agents fired shots into the crowd. “Sadly, in an attempt to disperse the angry youths who were resisting, there were shots by the security agencies and unfortunately, one of the protesters was hit by a bullet and he died. “As we speak right now, calm has been restored to the area and we are making arrangements for the dead to be buried,” the council boss said. Efforts to get the state police command spokesperson, DSP Catherine Anene, were not successful as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
