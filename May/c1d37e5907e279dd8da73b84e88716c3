THE Federal Government on Tuesday announced that it had been able to feed about 10 million school children under its National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, announced this in Abuja and also stated that over 100,000 cooks had been engaged by the Federal Government through the NHGSFP. Farouq disclosed this at the zonal flag-off and handover of feeding utensils to the Federal Capital Territory under the National Social Investment Programme. The NHGSFP is one of the four key interventions of the Federal Government through the NSIP. The minister explained that the aim of the school feeding programme was to increase enrollment of children into schools, boost their nutrition, encourage entrepreneurship, enhance agricultural production and generate rural jobs across the country.
