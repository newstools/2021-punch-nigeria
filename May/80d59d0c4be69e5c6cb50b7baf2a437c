The Nigerian Business Coalition against AIDS has piloted the first phase of the ‘’I know My status’’ project in Abuja, Ebonyi and Edo states respectively. The Project which was developed from the End HIV Campaign was designed and implemented to increase the knowledge of vulnerable people on their HIV status and enough safe sexual practices through HIV Testing Services and dissemination of Sexual and Reproductive Health information. The Chief Executive Officer at NIBUCAA,
Isaiah Owolabi, said, “The I know My Status Project is expedient to reduce the incidence of HIV in Nigeria, there is a need for continuous dissemination of sexual and reproductive health information; HIV prevention and treatment information; continuous HIV Counselling and Testing especially among adolescent and young people, women, and transport workers. This is because these populations fall within the high prevalence age bracket.’” Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Oluwatobi Ojo, noted that the intervention is an eye-opener as it revealed the agitations of some people in the communities regarding HIV testing. He also stated that there is a need for increased awareness in rural areas as Knowing one’s HIV status is key to societal progress.
