In a bid to ensure affordable housing for residents of Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule has launched the construction of the Peninsula Hills Housing Estate in the Karu Local Government Area of the state. The governor, who spoke at the ceremony on Friday, explained that the Peninsula Hills Housing Estate was a public-private partnership initiative with Affinity Realty. He said the project was part of activities to commemorate the second anniversary of his administration. He said, “Two hundred and seventy hectares of land were marked for the project, but for a start, the government had given approval for only 100 hectares to be used for 4,400 houses. Aside from providing land, we have been able to construct some roads and other necessary logistics for the smooth execution of the project.” According to him, provision of housing is one of the important things his administration intends to achieve to change the situation of the underprivileged for the better. Earlier, Chairman Affinity Realty, Mohammed Abubakar, expressed gratitude to the state government for giving the company the opportunity to address the problem of housing deficit in the state. Meanwhile, Sule, while paying a visit to the Emir of Nasarawa, Alhaji Ibrahim Jibril, promised to pay all outstanding salaries of local government staff in the state, which he said would also improve the standard of living of the workers and promote peace in their various councils.
