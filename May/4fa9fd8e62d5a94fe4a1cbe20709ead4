An All Progressives Congress governorship aspirant, Azuka Okwuosa, has given a breakdown of the measures required to combat insecurity in Anambra state. He enunciated that the security of Anambrarians is a priority to him and he would ensure that it is combatted to the latter. He identified with the pains of Anambrarians who had lost loved ones and properties to the unchecked criminal activities in the state. He further enumerated how he intends to eliminate the threats of insecurity in the state when he assumes office in November.  He said, “Insecurity has come to be a pertinent concern in Anambra state and Nigeria as a whole. Within the last two years, crime within the state has almost gotten to an all-time high. It is easy to say that the issue of insecurity is consistent across the nation, given that reports of attacks have sprung up in virtually every state. “However, a decisive number of killings, armed robberies, kidnaps, cult clashes and hostile attacks have occurred in Anambra without an appropriate response from security operators.” Okwuosa noted that insecurity in the state could take its toll on the overall development of the state if not properly checked. According to him, the bulk of the responsibility to address security challenges rests on the government. He recommended dialogue as the first step to solving all forms of conflicts. “With no alternative means to make ends meet, some of them have resorted to criminal activities. To solve this problem, jobs will be created in other sectors like agriculture, commerce and industry, education and tourism, so the youth of the state can get effectively engaged,” he said The aspirant noted that he would retrain the state vigilante groups to ameliorate their approaches and process to meet global standards.
