Six people were reportedly killed in two local government areas of Benue State between Saturday and Sunday. According to a report gathered on Monday, two people were said to have been killed in a communal clash that had been ravaging the Gwer East Local Government Area of the state while four other people were said to have been killed by suspected herdsmen in Gwer West Local Government Area. In Gwer East which had been engulfed in communal crisis, locals claim that people of Mbakume and Mbasombo in the council had embarked on a renewed clash. One of the locals who identified himself as Donald explained that the renewed crisis began last week leading to the burning down of houses adding that two people were killed on Saturday. The Benue State Police Command Spokesperson, DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed the death of two people in the renewed communal clash. Anene said, “There are meetings going on, their issue (communal clash) needs a round table talk, the people need to sit down and talk about it because it is a lingering crisis. “There was a time the command talked to them and they even signed some things, so what caused the renewed crisis is what the command needs to understand but as of now two persons were killed but I don’t have the record of houses burnt.”
