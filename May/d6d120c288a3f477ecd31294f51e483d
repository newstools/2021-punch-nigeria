THE Osun State Police Command on Sunday said its men, with the support of local security outfits, foiled an attempt by some suspected Fulani bandits to rob motorists along Ilesha/Akure expressway. In a video obtained by The PUNCH, posted on the social media by a supporter of Yoruba nation, who claimed to have arrived at the scene of the attack few minutes after the assailants struck on Saturday, claimed that seven people were abducted by the suspected Fulani herdsmen. The man said the incident happened along Ilesha/Akure expressway shortly after Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, passed the road while returning from Akure after his group had held a rally to demand for an independent Yoruba nation. Reacting to enquiries on the incident in a statement, the state Police Command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, said no one was abducted, even though attempt was made by some suspected Fulani bandits. Opalola said, â€œIt is true that some suspected Fulani bandits came out of the bush and attempted to rob some motorists along Akure/Ilesha road, by Iwaraja on Saturday, 22nd May, 2021, at about 6:00pm, but for the quick intervention of the Police, JTF and other local security outfits.
