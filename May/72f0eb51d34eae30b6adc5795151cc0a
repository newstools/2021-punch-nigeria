The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to tackle food insecurity, claiming that Nigerians are starving and dying. The PDP made this call in a statement on Sunday, titled, ‘Nigerians are starving, dying, address food insecurity now, PDP tells APC, Buhari.’ The PDP urged Buhari and the APC-led administration to tackle the issue of increasing food insecurity, hunger, and starvation in the country. “The PDP laments that under Buhari, over 82.9 million Nigerians can no longer afford their daily meals due to the failure of the administration to take practical steps to grow and protect the food sector, thereby leading to severe food scarcity with prices soaring beyond the reach of Nigerians,” the statement partly read. The statement also recounted the changes that have occurred during Buhari’s regime. “Due to the misrule of the APC and Buhari administration, our country now ranks as 98 out of 107 in Global Hunger Index, with an agonising food shortage, collapsed purchasing power; alarming 33.3 percent unemployment and 22.95 food inflation rates as well as increased morbidity and mortality rates,” read the statement. The party further charges the president to address hunger issues in the country “by opening our silos to cushion the situation and push down prices.” They further advised that the “Federal Government should also realign the agricultural sector by beefing up security in food production areas so that our farmers can return to the farmland.”
