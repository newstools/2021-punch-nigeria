GUNMEN attacked a police patrol team at Agu community, a few kilometres from Asaba end, before Ossissa Bridge, on Kwale-Asaba Road in Delta State on Tuesday evening. One of the mobile police men was reportedly shot dead by the hoodlums who struck at about 4.15 pm. The lifeless body of the policeman lying in a pool of his blood was sighted by journalists after the attack. An oil tanker with open doors and an abandoned motorcycle were also sighted at the scene of the attack. Witnesses said that the identity of the gunmen and their motives were still unknown as of the time of filing this report. A white colour security patrol van with some armed policemen, however, arrived at the scene after the incident. When contacted, the acting Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, DSP Bright Edafe, claimed that he had not been briefed on such incident as of the time of filing this report.
