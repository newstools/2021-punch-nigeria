The Ogun State Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mrs Kikelomo Longe, said that the state’s automation of Business Premises Permit processing, aimed at improving the ease of doing business in Ogun was nearly completed, according to a press statement issued by the ministry on Thursday. She was reported as saying this at an industrial tour of both Intercontinental Distillers Limited and De-United Food Industries Limited, in Ota. She said that the Prince Dapo Abiodun-led administration had been working on ensuring all ministries involved in improving the state’s ease of doing business ranking automated their processes. Longe stated that the present administration had been implementing major initiatives, policies and programmes towards making the state the industrial destination of choice. According to her, the planned Investment Summit scheduled to hold in July would help investors across the world get to discover more untapped investment opportunities in the state. She said, “The automation of business permit process in Ogun State will soon be ready and this will help simplify the process. “Business owners can process their business permit online. This is one of the various steps we are taking to improve the ease of doing business.” Longe said that as part of the efforts of the Dapo Abiodun-led administration to address the road challenges in the Ota axis, the state government had begun the construction of the Agbara-Atan-Lusada Road.
