Owerri, the Imo State capital was on Saturday deserted following the sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra. Our correspondent who monitored the development observed that there was almost a total lockdown in the state capital. While almost all the shops and works places remained locked, residents stayed indoors throughout. Only a few vehicles were seen on the roads, while pubs, eateries and supermarkets didn’t open for the day. People found it difficult to see where to buy foodstuff and other items. Those who had emergency situations to attend to trekked long distances. The ever-busy Douglas, Wetheral, Ikenegbu and Bank roads were deserted as security operatives patrolled the city. Only a few persons were seen in Orji discussing the UEFA Champions League final match between Chelsea and Manchester City. While some said that they would rather remain indoor than risk their lives watching the thriller, others were heard saying that they couldn’t afford to miss the match. Another resident who did not want his name in print said that he would obey the sit-at-home order to the letter. He said that it was part of his way to tell the Federal Government that the Igbo were not happy with its administration. Few motorcyclists who managed to come out doubled their charges per trip. Soldiers made people raise their hands above their heads while trekking around the military checkpoints. The Police Spokesperson in the state, Bala Elkana, told our correspondent that the police in conjunction with other security agents were in charge of the security of the state. He urged the people of the state to go about their lawful businesses without any fear or molestation.
