Popular Nigerian TV host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, has revealed that he will return as the host of Big Brother Naija season six reality television show. He shared the news on his verified Instagram page by posting a picture of himself looking dapper in a suit and wrote in the caption section, “Well, guess who’s returning as the host of the next season of #BBNaija. Let’s go again guys!!!” Big Brother Naija, formerly known as Big Brother Nigeria, is a reality competition television series, based on the Big Brother television franchise. The show began to air in Nigeria on March 5, 2006, and its main presenters were Olisa Adibua and Michelle Dede. However, the show was put on hold till January 22, 2017. When it resurfaced, Obi-Uchendu, who was a contestant in the maiden edition, became the host of the show. He holds the position to date. Meanwhile, a few weeks ago, a Twitter user suggested that Obi-Uchendu be replaced with Frank Edoho — an established presenter who hosted the popular TV game show, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, for 13 years. The tweet read, “Ebuka don eat small, make him allow another person chop! Frank Edoho as BBNaija host for this season won’t be a bad choice tho. Eviction night go choke gan!!!”(sic) The suggestion sparked a debate, especially on Twitter. To quell the debate, Edoho tweeted, “What did Ebuka do to deserve all this? Why would you want to change someone that has done a show successfully for only three years and have him replaced with one who did WWTBAM for 13 years? Leave Ebuka alone! Please.” The popular reality TV show has topped previous seasons as its organisers, MultiChoice, announced a grand prize of N90m for the current season.
