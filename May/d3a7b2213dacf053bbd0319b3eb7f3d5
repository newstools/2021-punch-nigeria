The Peoples Democratic Party on Thursday said the All Progressives Congress is embarking on a wild goose chase by going after the Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade. National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said this in a telephone interview with The PUNCH. He said the Cross River State Governor as a committed party member was aware of measures put in place by the leadership of the PDP, the Governor Aminu Tambuwual-led PDP Governors Forum, and the Senator Bukola Saraki-led Reconciliation and Strategy Committee to make him comfortable within the party’s fold. Ologbondiyan said, “The APC Governors, as usual, went to Cross River as part of their jamboree. “How can a party which has failed to hold congresses and a convention for over one year attract a committed PDP member who is at home with a structured party? “The APC should be made aware that Governor Ayade has assured our party of his unalloyed loyalty.”
