A commodities broker, Marex Spectron, has said it is considering an initial public offering on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Marex said on Friday that it intends to have a free float of at least 25 per cent of the business and expects that it would be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK indices, according to ShareCast. Acquisitions have historically been an important growth driver for Marex and the company said they continued to form a “central pillar” of its strategy. The Chief Executive, Ian Lowitt, said, “Marex is able to provide access to the world’s largest commodity markets with our broad and specialised offering which enables the business to serve the diverse needs of the largest commodities and financial markets clients. “Marex is an agile, technology driven business, with advanced data and analytics capabilities, operating in a growth market with high barriers to entry. The attractiveness and resilience of our business model is demonstrated by our latest set of results which showcase continued strong performance despite the obvious macro headwinds. “I am excited about the next stage of our development and the growth opportunities ahead. We look forward to generating continued value for all our stakeholders.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
