A 25 year old man, Musa Shamsudeen, was paraded at the Katsina State Police Command headquarters on Tuesday for allegedly treating sick bandits, as well as those with gunshots injuries. The police said Shamsudeen, who was arrested in one of the communities in Kankara had been on their wanted list since bandits abducted the 344 pupils of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in December. The spokesman for the state police command, SP Gambo Isah, said, “Shamsudeen disappeared from the Kankara community shortly after the abduction of the pupils of Government Science Secondary School and he only returned to the community recently. But based on a tip-off, we were able to pick him up.” The nine other suspects paraded included five alleged bandits, a rapist and three cattle rustlers. Isah said the police recovered 69 cows and three locally-made guns. He said all the suspects would be prosecuted after completion of investigation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
