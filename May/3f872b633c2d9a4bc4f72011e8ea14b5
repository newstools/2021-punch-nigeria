Recall that reports of alleged imminent attacks on some locations in Abuja have been causing apprehension among residents. Attah said the task force and other relevant agencies arrested the beggars during combined operations in Abuja. He said, “In the last two days, over 150 beggars have been apprehended across the city and more arrests are still going on. “Those apprehended were taken to the Bwari Area Council Centre for rehabilitation. “The FCT has a functional rehabilitation and training centre for such persons. “Sadly, very few of them stay there and get full rehabilitation, while many others find their way to run and sometimes they request to be allowed to go back to their states. “But what is fundamental is that some of these persons are being brought by other persons into the FCT. You will see young people leading blind aged men, we felt that is not what the city should be.” Attah said the FCT authorities were targeting those who always bring the beggars into Abuja from different states. He said such people would be apprehended and prosecuted.
