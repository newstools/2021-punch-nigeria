Ex-Ivorian captain and Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, has said that Chelsea players must play tonight’s Champions League final as it is their last opportunity to win the title. He said this in his words of encouragement to his former Chelsea team, who tonight will take on Manchester City in the Champions League final at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal in front of roughly 12,000 fans. The 43-year-old Ivorian posted a video on his Twitter page in which he urged that players of the Chelsea team believe in themselves and to “play as if this is [their] last chance to a Champions League game.” “Rise to the occasion,” Drogba enthused, “Believe! Believe! It’s in your DNA. This is our legacy to you. Come on, you Blues! Come on, Chelsea!” The Champions League final tonight will present The Blues the chance to win its second Champions League title, having won its first in 2012 in the match played against Between Munich at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. Drogba himself had played a key role in Chelsea’s first Champions League success, as he’d scored the equaliser for Chelsea which dragged the game into extra time and then penalties, which Chelsea won after goalkeeper Petr Čech saved a low drive effort from Bayern’s Arjen Robben.
