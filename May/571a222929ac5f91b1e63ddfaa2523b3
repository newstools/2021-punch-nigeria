The President of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, Dr Anderson Ezeibe, said there was no truth in the statement credited to the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, that the Federal Government had met the striking union’s demand. Ezeibe, in an inteview with Saturday PUNCH, said, “The claim by the Minister of State on the government meeting our demands is not correct. “In fact, it is doubtful if the minister is even knowledgeable about the issues in contention and the extent of resolution as he has not been part of the negotiations or any of the review meetings. “His claims are poorly packaged pieces of blackmail and an indictment on the extent of his knowledge of the challenges confronting the sector. “ASUP is still on strike and its member are very focused on the object of the dispute.” Ezeibe said only the union’s National Executive Council can review or modify the strike in anyway. He said such decision could only be taken  if the NEC is satisfied with the progress made. “The union will not bow to such piece of roadside blackmail and cheap propaganda from any quarter,” he added.
