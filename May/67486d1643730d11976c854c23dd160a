Makinde also stated that the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, lseyin Campus, would commence operation in the new session starting in September/October 2021. “Let me also point out that when we came to Iseyin in Oke-Ogun to campaign for the 2019 election, there was no Amotekun in the area of security and we have created the outfit today. “When we flagged off Moniya-Iseyin road in 2019, they said it was an audio project; that the people will only hear about it but won’t see it. Two days ago, they also said we don’t have any project to commission for our second anniversary in office, but even if we have not commissioned the road, has the road not been completed? Have people not started plying the road?” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
