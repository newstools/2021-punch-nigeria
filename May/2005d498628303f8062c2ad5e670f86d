The state said it is painful to lose Dare about 32 days after the death of Yinka Odumakin, a human rights activist, who also hailed from the state. The statement read, “The Governor, government and the people of the State of Osun received with pain and shock, the news of the demise of our son, Pastor Dare Adeboye, and wish to express our deepest and sincere sympathy on this sad loss. “Dare was one of your seeds who had chosen to follow closely in his reverred father’s footsteps. “No parent deserves this kind of loss. We feel your pain. Our dear state has lost yet again another bright light.
