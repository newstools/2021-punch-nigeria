Temitayo Jaiyeola with agency report Binance Holdings Limited is under investigation by the US justice department and internal revenue service, according to Bloomberg News on Thursday. The company is allegedly under probe for money laundering and tax offenses. Although the government agencies haven’t accused Binance of any illegalities, the company has issued a statement to assuage the situation. As part of the probe, officials who probe money laundering and tax offenses have sought information from individuals with insight into Binance’s business, the report on Bloomberg said. Binance spokeswoman, Jessica Jung, said in an emailed statement, “We take our legal obligations very seriously and engage with regulators and law enforcement in a collaborative fashion. “We have worked hard to build a robust compliance programme that incorporates anti-money laundering principles and tools used by financial institutions to detect and address suspicious activity.” Copyright PUNCH.
