THE Ogun State chapters of the People’s Democratic Party and the Action Alliance have rejected the timetable for the state Local Government Council elections. The Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission had during the stakeholders’ meeting in Abeokuta on Tuesday announced July 24, 2021, as the date for the elections. The Chairman OSIEC, Babatunde Osibodu, while briefing stakeholders which included nine political parties and newsmen, promised to carry everybody along. Osibodu said, “Look at how we have started. The law in Ogun State, Section 10 (1) of the Ogun State Electoral law states that the commission should give not less than 30 days’ notice of election. How many days have we given?  85 days’ notice. “The law says 30 days and we gave 85 days. That is to make sure that every party that wishes to take part, every stakeholder that wishes to be involved has sufficient and ample time for whatever they need to do and we are also here today to answer all your questions on transparency.” Osibodu, however, announced a waiver for female candidates. He said forms will be given to them for free. There were however protests from some political parties who accused the electoral management body of failing to formally invite them for the meeting. State chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Sikitullah Ogundele, expressed reservations about the timetable noting that sufficient notice was not given before the meeting. He, however, vowed that the PDP would not boycott the election despite the alleged noticeable irregularity on the part of the commission. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
