The Ogun State Government says it has extended the ban to the sale of all cooling system servicing and repair of air-conditioning and refrigerating units across the state until further notice. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Environment, Ola Oresanya, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. The government had last week Friday announced the ban on the sale and repair of industrial gas after five explosions hit some parts in Abeokuta. Explaining the extension of the ban to cooling gas, Oresanya said it was to allow for proper investigation into recent gas explosions in the state. He added that the explosion arose from sources suspected to have engaged in the adulteration of these combustible products, which has led to the loss of lives. The statement read in part, “Technicians who specialise in the repairs and servicing of these cooling systems, and dealers on the affected gas types, are directed to adhere strictly to this ban in their own interest and that of the public. “With the recent incidence of gas explosions in Ogun state, the State government in its bid to ensure that no further lives are lost through similar circumstances, or any other avoidable circumstance whatsoever is placing a ban on all cooling systems related gas sales, purchase and use, until further notice. Compliance is not optional.” Oresanya called on all dealers, retailers, and technicians in the combustible products to comply immediately with the ban as the state government will clamp down on any outlet or individual that flouts the order.
