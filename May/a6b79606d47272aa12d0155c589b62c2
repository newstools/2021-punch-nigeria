Talented Nigerian singer and a judge on the Nigerian Idol reality television show, Seyi Shay, has responded to critics who believe that her judging technique is quite harsh. Ever since the show began its auditions some months ago, the singer has been heavily criticised due to the way Seyi Shay judges the contestants. In an episode of Rubbin Minds with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, the delectable songstress noted that she is paid to be a judge on the show and not a psychiatrist. Seyi Shay added that she is only being honest and blunt with the contestants but Nigerians do not seem ready to hear the truth. She said, “I did not think that Nigerians were not ready for the truth. I am quite blunt and I keep it real all the time; I don’t beat around the bush. The first show was such a shocker. At the end of the day, it is TV and it will always be made to look more elaborate than it was. “Most of the contestants that came to audition for Nigerian Idols were really good and a few of them were really bad. I am here to judge. Now, we have gone into the live episodes; so, it is now in Nigerian’s hands to decide who to be on the show or not.” According to her, earlier in the recording of the show, the onus was on the three judges to either kick people out or allow them to stay. She continued, “My reactions are real and very honest, but I did not know Nigerians were not ready to hear the truth. I am there to do a job; I was paid to do a job. I am a judge and not a counsellor or psychiatrist. I am there to tell the truth. I am always keeping it real. I feel like too many people are hooked on smoke screens and mirrors and social media plays a big part.” The songstress stated that if Nigerians said more of the truth to each other, people would be able to make better decisions for the country and economy, and would probably not vote for the people chosen to lead the country. “The point is that I am a judge and I am doing a great job,” Seyi Shay noted.
