The Minister of Sports and Youths Development, Mr Sunday Dare, has urged Nigerian youths to equip themselves with necessary skills in their chosen careers to enable them to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of the country. The minister gave the advice while addressing students of the Baptist High School in Jos during his visit as part of the activities marking the school’s 60th anniversary. Dare said it was the responsibility of the government to ensure that there were opportunities for the youth to contribute their quotas to the development of the country. He said, “The youth must desire to advance in a particular career and by being disciplined. You must put yourself in the skills that are necessary. “The second aspect is that the government must provide necessary opportunities for the youth by opening the windows and doors for them to have easy access. So, unless our youths strive and be part of those opportunities, they cannot benefit from them.” The minister, who graduated from the school in 1983, promised to fix the sporting facilities in the institution. He also charged the management of the school to work out modalities for ensuring that students participated in the next National Principals’ Cup Competition, which he said had been revived after 27 years of inactivity. The Principal of the school, Mrs O.C. Anunobi,  appealed to the minister to provide an accessible road to the school, a permanent military post, improved sporting facilities, and a UTME computer-based test centre, among others . The President of the Baptists Old Students Association, Mr Temine Mite, said his members would continue to do their best for the uplift of the school. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
