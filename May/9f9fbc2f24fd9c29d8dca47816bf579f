As part of efforts to check rising insecurity, the Rivers State Government said it had begun enumeration of all commercial vehicles across the state. The government said the move was in line with its automation of the transportation sector. The Senior Special Assistant to the Rivers State Governor on Information and Communication Technology, Ibifuro Asawo, disclosed this during the pre-screening orientation of over 7,000 applicants vying for 500 spaces in the state free ICT training. Ibifuro said the automation was to generate code for all commercial vehicles in the state for safe tracing of any item lost in the vehicles, check insecurity and safety of passengers, as well as ensure their comfort. He explained that the exercise would also capture taxi operators, adding that there was ongoing automation for business place registration which involved cataloguing of every business operating in the state, whether small, medium or big. Asawo said, “The health sector automation is already ongoing, with the state teaching hospital. We are equally going to register four primary healthcare centres in this pilot stage and later every government-owned health facility will be covered. “Much later, the state Ministry of Health is going to begin the registration of all health facilities in the state, including all mortuaries, diagnostic centres, hospitals, clinics, maternity and radiotherapy centres, among others. “We have also automated the courts in the state; we are also now working with the chambers. There is a chamber information management system that is deployed for all law firms. They are also doing registration in their portal.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
