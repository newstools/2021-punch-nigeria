Champion Breweries Plc said its profit before tax rose by 102 per cent to N418.16m in the financial year 2020 from N206.57m in 2019. The firm said this on Wednesday in a statement, titled ‘Despite pandemic, Champion Breweries grows profit before tax by 102 per cent’. The company’s annual report also showed a 1.8 per cent increase in revenue generation to N7.05bn for the year ended December 31, 2020 from N6.93bn for the year 2019. It said operating profit for the business also grew by 91 per cent to N461.35m from the N241.48m recorded in 2019. Commenting on the results at the annual general meeting of the company, the Chairman, Dr Elijah Akpan, said even in the middle of the pandemic, which led to closure of businesses across the nation, Champion Breweries remained focused on dominating the market and breaking into new bounds within the South-South region. According to Akpan, 2020 was a challenging year that witnessed a widespread lockdown in Nigeria and all over the world, a year Nigerian economy reported negative growth balance and the buying power of the populace dwindled beyond projection. The consequence of this, according to him, led to the closure of many businesses and a rise in unemployment. He said Champion Breweries thrived through the year because it was committed to its values of passion for quality and drive for performance. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
