The Northern States Governors’ Forum has expressed sadness over the boat accident which claimed the lives of many passengers in Warra town, Ngaski Local Government Area of Kebbi State. As of Friday, Saturday PUNCH gathered that the death toll had risen to 76. The wooden boat was reportedly having about 200 passengers on board, coming from Niger State when it capsized. Forty-eight corpses were recovered as of Thursday. Speaking with one of our correspondents on Friday, the Chief Press Secretary to Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu, Alhaji Abubakar Muazu, said more bodies had been recovered. “So far, 76 bodies have been recovered,” he said. Muazu said rescue operatives from the National Emergency Management Agency and other organisations were still in the river trying to recover the bodies of the remaining passengers. He said the governor visited the accident scene on Friday to assess rescue efforts and condole with the families of the victims. He also said the governor had promised a donation of N11m to the victims’ families. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Northern States Governors Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement on Friday described the boat accident as “deeply distressing.” The statement read in part, “Northern governors assure their colleagues in Niger and Kebbi states of support and collaboration over the incident.” Copyright PUNCH.
