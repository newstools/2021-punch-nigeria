THE governing All Progressives Congress has appealed to Nigerians to support the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as he works towards finding a permanent solution to the nation’s security problems. This appeal was contained in a statement titled, ‘APC Welcomes Release of 29 Kaduna College Students’, which was signed by the party’s National Secretary, Sen. John Akpanudoeudehe, in Abuja, on Thursday. According to him, the APC was delighted about the release and safe return of 29 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, in Kaduna State. He said, “It is truly heart-warming that the students have been reunited with their family, friends and other loved ones. We deeply appreciate all stakeholders involved in the student’s release. “While the party and government share concerns of well-meaning Nigerians on the security incidents in the country, we reiterate our call to Nigerians for continued support of ongoing efforts by the President Muhammadu Buhari government at a quick and permanent solution to the security challenges.”
