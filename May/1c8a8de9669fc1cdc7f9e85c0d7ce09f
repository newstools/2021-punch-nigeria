The pet dog of the Obama family, Bo, died on Saturday, as announced by 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, via his Twitter account. Obama shared a few photos of Bo, including one showing the ex-president running alongside Bo down the hallway at the White House. “Today our family lost a true friend and loyal companion,” tweeted Obama. “For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, gentle presence in our lives—happy to see us on our good days, our bad days, and everyday in between.” Bo, fondly called the ‘First Dog of the United States’, was a male Portuguese Water Dog, of the species Canis lupus familiaris, originally from the Algarve region of Portugal. Bo was a gift from late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, and had been selected because Malia Obama’s allergies dictated the need for a hypoallergenic dog breed. The 12-year-old dog was named by Malia and Sasha Obama after their cousins’ cat and Michelle Obama’s father, in reference to the R&B musician Bo Diddley. The dog’s name also makes up the initials of Barack Obama (B.O.). As a eulogy to the recently deceased canine, Obama wrote, “He tolerated all the fuss that came with being in the White House, had a big bark but no bite, loved to jump in the pool in the summer, was unflappable with children, lived for scraps around the dinner table, and had great hair. “He was exactly what we needed and more than we ever expected. We will miss him dearly.” Bo, who joined the first family in the White House in April 2009, was the last presidential pet before President Joe Biden’s dogs, Major and Champ, joined the White House earlier this year.
