Gospel highlife singer, Abidemi Ogunmolu, aka Bidemi Olaoba, has said that the music video for his song, Akanchawa, would touch lives in many ways. He told Sunday Scoop, “The song which was released in October 2020 carries a message of hope and faith, which is very important for a day like this. We need God’s blessings more than ever. “We shot the video last year and I am very excited to release it now. I hope that the video would give more vitality to souls, as well as entertain and bless anyone who watches it. With the current state of the nation, I see the video giving hope to Nigerians. I believe that Nigeria would be sweet again.” Olaoba is the organiser of the virtual concert, Unrestricted Praise, which has featured gospel artistes such as Buchi, Tope Alabi, Mike Abdul, Adeleke Adeboye, Eben and Sammie Okposo.
