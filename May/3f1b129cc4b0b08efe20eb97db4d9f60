The Nigerian Air Force on Friday said it was committed to the medical care of personnel and their dependants. It said that was the reason behind the recent establishment of a tele-medicine centre which is due for inauguration during its forthcoming 57th anniversary. The chairman, organising committee, NAF 57th Anniversary, Vice Marshal Hassan Abubakar, disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja. He said the tele-medicine facility, which he described as the first of its kind among Armed Forces in Nigeria, will offer access to health care at a lower cost and will be inaugurated on May 18. According to him, the inauguration is the most unique among the events lined up for the anniversary. Abubakar said, “One unique activity that will be carried out during this year’s anniversary is the launching of the Nigerian Air Force tele-medicine facility here in Abuja. “It is the first of its kind in the Armed Forces of Nigeria. The aim of establishing the facility is to enhance the provision of excellent medicare to personnel and their dependants as well as civilian beneficiaries at the lowest possible cost.” He also said there would be medical outreach to host communities of various Nigerian Air Force Bases, adding that the Nigerian Air Force Officers Wives Association would embark on humanitarian support activities across the six geo-political zones of the country. He also said NAF would use the event to intimate Nigerians on its efforts in the fight against insurgency, terrorism, and banditry in the country. Explaining the reason for the theme of the anniversary celebration, ‘Enhancing Nigerian Air Force airpower capabilities for effective joint operations in response to contemporary national security challenges,’ Abubakar said it was aimed at emphasising the renewed focus on cooperation and collaboration among the services in military operations.
