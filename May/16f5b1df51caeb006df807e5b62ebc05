Members of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria have vowed to continue the ongoing strike in spite of the plea by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, for them to call off the strike. The leadership of the union made their position known in a communique signed by the National Deputy President, Emmanuel Abioye, and the General Secretary, Isaiah Adetola, after its National Executive Council meeting on Wednesday in Abuja. Recall that The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, had met with the CJN on Tuesday. Consequently, the CJN had urged the striking union to call off the strike. While the union commended the efforts of the CJN, the minister, and others in bringing an end to the strike, it however insisted that the strike would continue. According to the communique, the union stated that it would “continue with the ongoing industrial action until the provision of the constitution in contention is fully complied with as the provisions of the constitution are non-negotiable.” JUSUN also resolved to “deal with any state found not fully complying with its directive on the ongoing strike action while commending members to remain resolute.” The Union also warned that its members should not be victimized as a result of the ongoing strike action and expressed displeasure with some of the Chief Judges for working against the fight for financial autonomy. “NEC-in-session frowns at the attitude of some state Chief Judges on their anti-constitutional disposition on the full implementation of the financial autonomy of the Judiciary,” it said. It also condemned the decision of the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai in declaring the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, wanted. In the same vein, JUSUN also expressed its displeasure with the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi and called for the immediate payment of the withheld salary and dues accruing to the union.
