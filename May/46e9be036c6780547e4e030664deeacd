Nigerians have been urged to close ranks across ethnic and religious divides and to with their hands and voices speak up for the restoration and unity of the country. This was said in a statement by the #FixPolitics group in its state of the nation treatise on Saturday. “At times like this, the true hope for restoration and a brighter tomorrow lie as much in the hands of each of us, as it does in our voices. We must each be seen to act to keep the peace, and to preserve the union. “It is therefore with great respect and an unwavering sense of responsibility that our organisation, #FixPolitics, shares its reflections and recommendations on the tough path that we must follow, over the mounting doubts and fears,” the statement read. According to the group, the growing sense of deep foreboding in the country is unmistakable and persistent. “Once again, we are confronted with fundamental questions on the basis of our union, and the certainty of our future. While every nation in history exists as a consequence of answering these questions, the appalling manifestations of insecurity, which we are currently witnessing, are cause for extreme concern,” Speaking on the event, The Executive Director, #FixPolitics, Anthony Ubani, urged the citizens to rise to the crest of a renewed hope in a Nigeria where they could dare to dream of reaching their full potential as individuals, communities and one nation. “This we must achieve in an atmosphere of peace, social justice, well-being and shared prosperity. “If we must restore our nation to the path of greatness that the founders envisaged, we must correct the fundamentally flawed system that divorces political representation and executive action by political officeholders, from accountability to the people,” he said.
