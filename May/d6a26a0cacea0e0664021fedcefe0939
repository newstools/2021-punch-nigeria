Indications have it that the Southern Governors’ Forum has directed state houses of assembly in the South to enact law backing the ban on open grazing. The PUNCH reported that governors of the Southern region met in Asaba, the Delta State capital on Tuesday during which they came up with the ban on open grazing. The Chairman of South-South Governors’ Forum and Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa, said that every state would enact its law to enforce the ban. The governor, who spoke through the State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, stated this on Wednesday in an interview with The PUNCH in Asaba. He said, “Every state will put in place a law that will be used to prosecute anybody that goes against the ban. The governors of the south have agreed with their people that the right thing to do is to ban open grazing.”
