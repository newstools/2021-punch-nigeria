The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, on Sunday, asked the residents of the state to dispel the speculation that hoodlums want to attack the state again. The governor, who described as a false alarm the rumour that some bandits want to attacks institutions and Government facilities, assured that the security agents have the capacity to safeguard the state. Uzodimma spoke after a Church Service at the Government House Chaplaincy in Owerri, the state capital. The governor the rumour was aimed at putting fears in the mind of the people of the state. He said, “Imo people and residents should go about their businesses without fear of molestation or harassment. What happened in the past weeks will never repeat itself again. “Let me use this opportunity to reiterate my earlier stand that those perpetrating the violence and evil in Imo State are mostly not Igbo people but hired. “The Government under my watch will not allow those who visited mayhem on the people to operate again in Imo State. “We will crush anybody that attempts to cause mayhem or attack Imo people again. Government cannot surrender to blackmailers, hoodlums, and perpetrators of violence who have sworn to make the state ungovernable. “Over 400 of those who carried out the threats on the state in the past have been arrested and undergoing trials in the courts. The good thing is that over 70 per cent of them are not Igbo.” He also advised those planning to visit the state with any form of violence to have a rethink as “government is more than ever ready and prepared to keep Imo safe and secured.”
