SUPPORTERS of the Peoples Democratic Party under the auspices of Concerned PDP Stakeholders in Niger State, have dissociated themselves from statements made against the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, by a former Niger State Governor, Babangida Aliyu. Aliyu had in a veiled reference to Wike in an interview last week, said, “a dictator in Rivers State was behind moves to remove the National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus.” The PDP Concerned Stakeholders, in a statement jointly signed by Senator Zainab Kure, Abubakar Tanko and a former Deputy Governor of the State, Dr Shem Nuhu, on Thursday, said Aliyu’s views were personal to him. They said, “Dr Aliyu, who has worked against his own party and admitted the same in a signed press statement by himself should rather be remorseful in repentance. “He doesn’t seem to get the import of why President Goodluck Jonathan said he is a ‘pathetic liar,’ he missed the sense of former governors, Jonah Jang of Plateau State, Sule Lamido of Jigawa, Gabriel Suswan of Benue, calling him out as a liar. “Dr Babangida Aliyu seems to be a poor student of history, otherwise, he would have known that his utterances, attitude and cryptic attacks on Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state, by implying that Governor Wike is a dictator is careless, untrue and a nomenclature only befitting of himself.” Copyright PUNCH.
