Actress, Bolaji Ogunmola, has said that actresses are usually more entrepreneurial than their male colleagues, and that is why they seem to be doing better. Ogunmola, who participated in the Next Movie Star reality TV show in 2013, said, “This is because actresses are more entrepreneurial than actors. Also, women tend to invest their money more.” The actress also urged celebrities to use their platforms to talk about issues that affect society. She said, “Definitely, we (celebrities) should use our platforms to talk about issues that affect society.” The well-endowed entertainer also noted that being a private person had helped her to stay away from controversies and scandals in Nollywood. She said, “I am a very private person and really I love my personal space. That helps me to not be in the prying eyes of the public.” At a time when some actors take desperate measures to be featured in movies, Ogunmola said, “I would never go against my values and morals.” Copyright PUNCH.
