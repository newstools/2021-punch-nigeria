BANDITS have released 53 women and children they kidnapped in the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State last Monday. They, however, refused to release 22 kidnapped victims who are men. Speaking to The PUNCH on the telephone, the Councillor representing the area, Alhaji Bashar Yarkatsina, said the 53 women and children were released last night, explaining that the 23 men were still in their captivity. Garba said the victims were released following the intervention of the Zamfara State Government through its peace process. “They were released unconditionally and no ransom was paid. They have released 53 people who are mainly women and children but they are still holding the remaining 22 who are all males,” Garba said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
