The Cross River State Government says it is set to deploy digital medical drones in hard to reach areas of the state. A statement on Monday explained that the drones would supply drugs and other medical essentials to such areas. The state governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, stated this on Monday during the signing of Memorandum of Understanding with a drone delivery company, Zipline. Ayade said, “Cross River State is playing a special role in the heath sector. In 90 days, we will start the delivery of essential drugs to hard to reach areas facilitated by drone delivery systems.” He expressed optimism that going forward, Zipline would be a major stakeholder in quality health care  delivery in the state, especially when the state owned pharmaceutical company, Calapharm, started running. Zipline’s Senior Vice President, Daniel Marfo, commended Ayade’s strides in the health sector and pledged his company’s commitment to sustaining the tempo. Earlier, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Betta Edu, described the drone delivery system as a game changer in “ensuring that medical supplies, drugs, vaccines can be delivered to health centres in real time and in the shortest possible time.” Copyright PUNCH.
