The Rivers State Taskforce on street trading and illegal motor parks said it arrested one person after some commercial drivers attacked its members on duty at the Agip axis of Port Harcourt. They also alleged that some of the taskforce members were hospitalised as a result of the attack. Leader of the taskforce, team 08, Innocent Amadi, who disclosed this to newsmen narrated how a commercial driver around Agip roundabout attacked his men and attempted to hit them with his bus because they asked him to park properly. “The way the bus driver’s are behaving towards taskforce is not good. They want to hit us anytime they set their eyes on us. “We were helping to control the traffick at Agip junction. So one of the Vanagon driver packed wrongly and was causing obstruction on the road. “We tried to ask him to clear, but he tried to hit one of my men. One of my men entered his vehicle and he wanted to run away with him, but we chased and caught him. “They normally attack us each time they see us over nothing. Some of my men are lying down in the hospital as I am talking to you,” Amadi stated. One of the commercial drivers, admitted committing the offence and appealed for forgiveness. He said,” I was carrying passenhers at the Agip junction before they blocked me..I tried to escape, but no way. They arrested me because where I was loading is not a bus stop. “I don’t want them to take me to their office. I am guilty. They should forgive me,” the unidentified passenger stated.
