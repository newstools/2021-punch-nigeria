The National Directorate of Employment has adopted skills and acquisition training as a strategy to tackle unemployment in the country. The acting Director-General of NDE, Mr Nuhu Fikpo, said this in a statement on Monday. He was quoted to have spoken during the orientation ceremony marking the commencement of the training. “It has been observed that graduate trainees of the Basic National Open Apprenticeship Scheme may not be fully proficient to compete favourably in the business world. “It is against this backdrop that the management of NDE is implementing the Advance National Open Apprenticeship Scheme. The primary purpose of this training scheme is to ameliorate the daunting challenges posed by lack of marketable and functional skills and the rising rate of youth unemployment in our society,” Fikpo said. The acting Director-General who was represented by the NDE Ogun State Coordinator, Mr Bakare Tajudeen, said 40 trainees were recruited from the 20 local government areas in Ogun State. The training scheme, according to the statement will hold in all the 774 LGAs in Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
