The President of the Association of Automobile Boatyards Transport Equipment and Allied Employers of Nigeria, Mr Seyi Onajide, has said policy summersault in the country is driving investors away. Onajide advised that the Nigerian government and policymakers should encourage investors and other stakeholders by properly carrying them along when they need to change any policy. He gave the advice at the 41st Annual General Meeting of the association held at Otta, Ogun State. He said, “Policy summersault drives away investors. When you bring into the country a dollar and after few months the dollar becomes a fraction of it because of the policy change and make a mess of your investment in Nigeria, this kind of policy changes will affect how people see the country as a whole. “Let all stakeholders in every sector be carried along and listen to them before you change any policy. We are not afraid of change but put a human face to it.” Onajide, while expressing his team’s appreciation for their re-election to continue to steer the wheel of the association for another term, assured the members that they would live up to their expectations by doing things better than they did in the past. According to him, one of the objectives of the association is to see to the welfare of its members by bringing to the fore issues that affect the existence of their businesses such as double taxation and duties. Onajide said his team was prepared to do more advocacy this year. The AGM also confirmed the re-appointment of the Chairman of the Committee of Human Resource Experts, Mrs. Rose Osuinde, and the auditor, Anjorin+Anjorin and Co, for another financial year.
