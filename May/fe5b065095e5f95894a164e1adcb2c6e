The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, has said Nigeria needs transparency in governance to eliminate all fraud in all government activities and in the private sector. According to a statement issued on Friday by Ifeoma Irondi on behalf of the ministry’s Deputy Director/Head, Press and Public Relations, Onu said this during a visit to his office by the members of the executive council of the Chartered Institute of Computer Forensics of Nigeria. The statement was titled ‘Onu: Nigeria will overcome security challenges.’ According to the minister, the country has the needed resources, both human and material, to tackle the ongoing security challenges, especially by supporting forensic experts with the required evidence to prosecute crime. While highlighting how the application of cyber security could help reduce malpractices and fraud in government Ministries, Departments and Agencies and the Organised Private Sector in the country, he said there was a need for transparency within the public and private sectors. “Nigeria wants transparency in governance to eliminate all fraud in all government activities and in the private sector, which will help to reduce crime in the country,” the statement quoted Onu as saying. The minister also said the country needs more forensic experts to help prosecute crimes not just in Nigeria but also beyond the country in the nearest future, adding that the ministry will work through Executive Order 05 to create jobs and wealth for Nigerians. The President/Chairman of the Computer Forensics Institute of Nigeria, Prof. Peter Olayiwola, said the aim of the visit was to persuade the ministry to support the rapid execution of the chartered computer forensics bill.
