The wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday said she would continue to lead efforts to fight the menace of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence. She spoke in the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, during the presentation of three vehicles to three agencies of government to boost their capacities to fight against SGBV. The affected agencies are the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team and the Child Protection Unit of the state government, as well as the Gender Unit of the police. The governor’s wife, who is coordinating the state’s multi-sectoral stakeholders’ committee against SGBV, said, “We realised that some critical stakeholders amongst us require additional utility vehicles to scale up awareness, as well galvanise action to combat the menace of violence against our women and children. “We reached out to well-meaning individuals, corporate organisations and government establishments for support and the Lagos State Lotteries Board supported us with these three utility vehicles.” Mrs Sanwo-Olu urged the beneficiary agencies to put the vehicles to good use to frontally combat all forms of SGBV in their various forms. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Ms Titilayo Shitta-Bay said the vehicles would give the needed impetus to the fight against SGBV. The Chief Executive Officer of Lagos State Gaming and Lotteries Authority, Mr Bashir Are, said the donation of the vehicles was in furtherance of the vision of the agency to support good causes.
