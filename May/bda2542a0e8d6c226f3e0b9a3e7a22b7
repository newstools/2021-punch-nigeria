Wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, on Sunday, paid a condolence visit to the family of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died alongside 10 other military personnel on Friday when a Beachcraft 350 aircraft crashed at the Kaduna International Airport. Attahiru and the others were buried at the National Military Cemetery in Abuja on Saturday afternoon but the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has since been under fire for not attending the funeral rites despite his recent trip to Paris.  The President was represented by the Defence Minister, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd.). Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari; governors, Senators, House of Representatives members and other dignitaries also attended the burial and paid their final respects to the late military personnel. However, Mrs Buhari shared photos of her visit to the family of the late COAS on her social media platforms on Sunday.  “I paid a condolence visit to the family of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru. “The death of the Late Chief Of Army Staff and the other military officers aboard the ill-fated aircraft is a monumental loss to their families and the nation at large. “May their souls rest in peace, and may the Almighty grant their families the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss,” she captioned the photos.  Buhari had on January 26, 2021 appointed Attahiru to succeed Lt-Gen. Tukur Buratai as COAS.
