The Lagos State Government said on Wednesday that it wanted the retirees of the Lagos State Public Service to have a veritable source of income in retirement. The state Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, stated this during the quarterly training programme for retirees at the Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, Alausa, Ikeja. Muri-Okunola, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the office, Mr Samson Ajibade, explained that the training was meant to provide retirees with innovative skills for entrepreneurship development in diverse areas. He said, “The maiden edition of this programme which held last year December provided lots of retirees with the opportunities of being equipped with skills for entrepreneurship development in diverse areas. This year’s training is focused on fish, poultry and snail farming.” He appealed to the retirees not to see their retirement as an end of their work life, but as an avenue to explore their aspirations and become employers of labour. “Our amiable governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is convinced that your exit from the Lagos State Public Service is not the end of your work life. Your retirement is therefore seen as an opportunity for you pursue your aspirations.” “This programme is being held quarterly to empower retirees, ensure that they remain active, have veritable source of income, become self-sufficient, employers of labour, as well as contribute to the economic growth of the state,” he added.
