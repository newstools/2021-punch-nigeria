The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has said Nigeria will soon get 12 fighter jets from the United States of America to fight insecurity. He stated this while answering questions at the end of a two-day monetary policy committee meeting in Abuja on Tuesday. Emefiele said the arrival of the jets was in line with a pact made between the Nigerian and US governments three years ago. He said, “If you want an economy to grow, the level of insecurity must be low because if there is a high level of insecurity like what we see today, the economy will suffer. “About three years ago, the Federal Government and the US signed a pact that resulted in a government-to-government acquisition of military equipment out of which we are expecting 12 fighter planes. I am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August.” He also advised bandits to drop their arms and be a part of the apex bank’s Anchor Borrowers’ Programme, which is in its fifth year, designed by the CBN to boost food production. The CBN governor said, “If they do so, it will help them; if they choose not to do so, they will be confronted by the security as this battle continues.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
