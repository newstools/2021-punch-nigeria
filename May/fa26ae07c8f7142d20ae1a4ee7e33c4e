Intels Nigeria Limited has accused International Container Terminal Service Inc. of disregarding a court order that grants its permission to the Berths 9/10/11 at the Federal Ocean Terminal, Onne, Rivers State. Intels in a public statement claimed that a High Court of Rivers State issued an order which ring-fenced it from being ejected from the berth, and allowed it to maintain status-quo. It said the High Court of Rivers State in November 2020 extended an order of interim injunction restraining the Nigerian Ports Authority, its agents and employees from taking over Berths 9, 10, and 11 at the Federal Ocean Terminal, Onne Port Complex from INTELS Nigeria Limited. According to Intel, ICTSI is occupying its land and has demarcated a substantial area of it. The company also accused the authorities of complicity. Intel in the statement claimed that ICTSI had taken some of its property at the port too. Although the company said it had initiated legal proceedings against ICTSI, it made a subtle appeal to the Federal Government to come to its aid. Intels operates in Onne port situated on the Bonny river along Ogu creek, which is home to one of the largest oil and gas free zones in the world. The International Container Terminal Services Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of ICTSI, had reportedly signed an agreement with NPA to develop Berths 9/10/11 in 2021. Copyright PUNCH.
