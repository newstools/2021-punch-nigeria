With a growing number of internet users and widespread insecurity in Nigeria, a former presidential aspirant, Mr Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has warned that cyber threats can no longer be taken with levity. Olawepo-Hashim said this on Saturday as the keynote speaker at the virtual launch of a book titled, ‘Nigeria: Cyber power and National Security.’ The book was authored by a cybersecurity expert, Dr Oludare Ogunlana, who is based in the United States. Olawepo-Hashim said with over 104 million internet users, according to statistics, Nigeria had emerged as a cyber power. He said to retain a leadership position in cyberspace, the users, either for business or security, must trust the Nigerian intervention. He said, “At a time Nigeria is facing insecurity, and cyberterrorism being one of the central challenges, it is important to take certain lessons. With previous Boko Haram attacks on the infrastructures of the Department of State Services and the Nigerian Army, the threats to Nigeria are no longer theoretical.” The book’s author and event host, Ogunlana, said any country that would be considered a key player in today’s world must command a significant influence in cyberspace. He said, “Actually, Nigeria has what it takes to be a leader in cyber power based on the talents and human resources available to us. Cyberthreats are also real and we must understand their risks and impacts on national security.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
