THE Senate Public Accounts Committee has sustained the query issued by the Auditor General for the Federation to the National Agency for the Control of AIDS. The agency was indicted over its alleged failure to make available necessary records of its global funds for audit. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, while ruling on the matter at the panel’s last sitting, last week, wondered why the management of NACA failed to submit its financial activities concerning global funds for perusal. Urhoghide said his panel was interested in the financial activities surrounding the global fund such as amount received and its utilisation. The Director of Finance and Account of the agency, Nsikak Ebong, however, told the panel that the financial records of the global funds were available for necessary screening any day. The representative of the AuGF, Eyitatyo Ageshin, faulted the position of the DFA of NACA. He alleged that when his office requested for the documents in 2016, the agency could not present them. Ruling on the matter, Urhoghide said, “Why don’t you bring the necessary documents that would show us what you got from global fund? You were coming to the Senate to respond to the query raised against you and you didn’t bring any document to show us. We sustain the query.” The query partly read, “The records of Global Fund with the agency were not released for audit examination despite repeated demands. “The Director-General did not respond to my report dated 29th August, 2017. He should therefore be compelled to explain the incomplete financial statements.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
