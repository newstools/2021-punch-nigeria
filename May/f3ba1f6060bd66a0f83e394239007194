Captain and goalkeeper of Heartland FC, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, has expressed delight after keeping his first clean sheet of the 2020/21 season in the Nigeria Professional Football League. Ezenwa was in fine form at the Pantami Stadium in Gombe on Sunday as the Naze Millionaires soaked up pressure from Adamawa United and were on the back foot for almost the entire duration of the game, but picked up the maximum three points courtesy of a late goal from substitute Kingsley Maduforo in the 80th minute. Speaking with The PUNCH, the 32-year-old said he was delighted to have been able to finally keep a clean sheet but added that winning the game was his priority. He said, “I feel happy because keeping clean sheet is something that gives every goalkeeper joy, but the most important for me was the three points. It has taken the team to eight on the log now and we need to do more in our subsequent games because we know what is at stake trying to get a continental ticket which is our target.” Copyright PUNCH.
