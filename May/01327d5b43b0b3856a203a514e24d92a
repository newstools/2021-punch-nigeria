The organisers of the Agege international trade fair said about 500 vendors and 50,000 participants will be part of the programme meant to boost small-scale businesses in Lagos Sate. The convener of the event, Folahan Omotileolawa, said the trade fair scheduled July was also aimed at boosting entrepreneurship. He said, “It is an innovative platform developed to help the average entrepreneur in Lagos State to grow. We aim to host over 500 vendors with 50,000 visitors daily. “This year’s edition will be a physical and a virtual event, with participants from around the world. “The fair will go a long way in boosting trade and commerce in the state as well as reduce unemployment and we are also focusing on how our vendors will make big sales and return for their investment.” The Agege Local Government Area Chairman, Ganiyu Ogunjobi, represented by his media aide, Rotimi Sulaimon, commended the organisers, adding that the council was in support the fair. He said, “We are fully behind this trade fair, this event is ours. It is one of the biggest events in our council. We must appreciate the roles the SMEs play in our economy; we will be deceiving ourselves if we think the government is the sole driver of our economy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
