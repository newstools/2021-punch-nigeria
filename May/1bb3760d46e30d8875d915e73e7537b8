…Expresses confidence in Idris Aregbe’s bid for chairman As the ruling All Progressives Congress prepares for its council election primaries, the Surulere Renewal Group has urged all peace-loving people in Lagos state to pray for peace and tranquility. In a statement signed by its Director-General, Mr. Peter Ade Babalola, the group emphasised that during Sunday church services, christians in Surulere Council should pray for God’s special grace and blessings to enable Idris Aregbe move the area forward.  “Even though we can attest to his very good human qualities and determination to move Surulere forward in terms of genuine people-focussed policies and development, a cabal is working to frustrate the will of the people. “The ruling party has ‘change’ as one of its slogans but a few powerful elements are determined to impose incapable leadership here but Surulere is not like any other place; the will of God and the will of the people must prevail here. “Our group has no allegiance to any political party but we are very much impressed by the capacity and capability of Idris Aregbe and we shall emphatically say the truth at all times. “Therefore, as believers in the might and power of God Almighty, we urge all the good people of Surulere who are going to church tomorrow to fervently pray for the success of our idealist younger brother, Idris Aregbe in next Saturday’s primaries of Surulere APC,” the group stated.
