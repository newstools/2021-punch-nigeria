The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has warned traditional rulers against allowing cultists in their various domains. The governor gave the warning following the violent clashes among youths of Ikare Akoko town in the Akoko North East Local Government and Owo, the headquarters of the Owo LGA in the past few days, during which about 10 people were reportedly killed. He vowed to sanction any monarch who allowed cult clashes in their towns. Akeredolu gave the warning in a state-wide broadcast on Thursday. Akeredolu said some of the security issues needed to be fixed, including influx of strange faces into the state, activities of cultists, irresponsible use of the social media and chieftaincy tussles and land disputes. He said, “In furtherance of the efforts of our administration to address frontally these emergent and aforementioned security matters in our state, the following measures have been put in place. “All traditional rulers in the state should henceforth revert to the government before allowing any group to settle in their domains; any departure from this will be sanctioned. All residents should be vigilant and report any untoward movement in their areas to relevant security agencies. “Any traditional ruler that is found unable to contain the activities of cultists in his domain shall be sanctioned by the government according to the law. “Every individual having illegal firearms are advised to submit them to the security agencies as government has mandated the security agencies to prosecute any person found with weapons.” Copyright PUNCH.
