No fewer than 242 unemployed youths are to be trained in Gombe State by the Federal Government through the National Directorate of Employment. This comprises 220 for Basic National Open Apprenticeship Scheme, 20 people across 11 local government areas and 22 others in the Advanced National Open Apprenticeship Scheme. Speaking at the induction of the trainees on Friday, the Acting Director General of NDE, Abubakar Fikpo, said the training would help participants undergo life skills that would support them become self reliant. The acting director general, who was represented by Umar Yusuf, said the mandate of the NDE is to empower Nigerians to realise their potential especially with the current economic situation. He said, “The NDE was created in 1986 but became operational in 1987 due to the economic meltdown in the country. Where we had alot of unemployed due to the meltdown alot of our industries were shutdown and our naira was devalued. With trainings such as this many unemployed can be better empowered,.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
