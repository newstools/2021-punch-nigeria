New Super Eagles invitee, Abraham Marcus, said it was a dream come true to get invited to the senior national team. The Feirense CD midfielder was one of the four uncapped players invited by Eagles coach Gernot Rohr for the international friendly against Cameroon on June 4. Rohr invited 31 players in the provisional squad released by the Nigeria Football Federation for the tie billed Wiener Neustadt in Vienna, Austria. In a chat with ESPN, an elated Marcus said his late dad had always wanted him to Nigeria’s green and white colours. “I told my late dad before he passed that any time I step foot in Europe and have a good season, I will surely make it to the national team,” Marcus told ESPN. “My dad loved football and he always wanted to see me in the Super Eagles. So, when I saw my name on the list, the first thing I did was to go straight to the bathroom to relieve myself. I did not believe it. “I looked at the name again to make sure there was no mistake, and then I called my boss to ask him if this was really me or somebody else. “Even when he said it was me, I still did not quite believe it and then a few minutes later, my phone started blowing up. I think that was when I finally believed that it was me. “I was very, very excited when I saw my name on the list. It is a dream come true. “It is a privilege to play with the big players in Nigeria like Ahmed Musa, Alex Iwobi, Peter Etebo, Victor Osimhen. I cannot wait to meet everyone,” he added.
