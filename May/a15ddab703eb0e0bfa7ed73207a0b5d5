The Acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, on Thursday revealed that the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad complicated the nation’s security challenges. He said the regular policemen and women have found it difficult to immediately assume the roles left by the disbanded unit. Baba said this during a pressing briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The police boss said that the newly instituted Special Weapons And Tactics squad was yet to go fully operational. He, however, assured Nigerians that the Force is upskilling them for the new responsibility. “The security situation of the country has been significantly stabilise from time to time but we think if it is stabilising then are isolated insurgency coming from these zones in terms of attacks on police facilities and police personnel, even all law enforcement agencies including the military,” he said. “Therefore, we decided to, one, rejig the morale of our personnel, which has been a little bit dampened since the #EndSARS thing went. “With the proscription of SARS and establishment of SWAT, which has not been able to take off fully, we had a vacuum in tackling most of the violent crimes from our position of strength.” On the recruitment of 10,000 new policemen, the IGP stated that the process is 70 per cent done. He added that the Federal Character Commission and Police Service Commission will ensure the reflection of federal character and other requirements in the process.
