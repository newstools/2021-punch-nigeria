Two persons were killed and others injured on Sunday after hoodlums intercepted a lorry carrying onions at Ahiara Junction in the Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area of Imo State. While the onions were intercepted at the junction, the mayhem occurred at Afor Enyiogugu, where the hoodlums started sharing the produce to people. Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that security operatives who were drafted to the scene shot in the air in a bid to disperse the crowd, but stray bullets killed two persons and injured others. One of the victims was a motorcyclist, who was simply identified as Jeremiah. The source said, “Hoodlums intercepted a lorry carrying onions and they came to Afor Enyiogugu and started sharing them. A big crowd was rushing and picking them. Security operatives from Owerri arrived and started shooting and that was how we got these casualties. “A spokesperson for the police in the state, Bala Elkana, said he had not been briefed. ”Copyright PUNCH.
