Barely six hours after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu left Bende LGA headquarters after a civic reception of a three-time (12 years) immediate past House of Representatives member who represented Bende Federal Constituency, Hon. Nnenna Ukeje, gunmen burnt Bende Police Station, in Bende LGA. This was just a few hours after the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency office at Amaekpu was burnt. The police station is situated at the outer gate of the LGA headquarters and about less than 10 metres from the LGA field where the occasion held. According to nearby residents, “We heard series of gunshots, and when we rushed outside, we saw the station on fire.”
