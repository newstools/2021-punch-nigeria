The medium repoted that the incident forced Gambari and the administrative officer, Abubakar Maikano, to abandon their residences. “Their houses were robbed and the robbers packed money and other valuable assets from both houses,” the medium had quoted a source as saying. It is yet to be ascertained how armed robbers gained access into the well-fortified Presidential Villa manned by a combined team of policemen, officials of the Department of State Services and men of the Presidential Guards Brigade of the Nigeria Army.
