Allianz says it has officially begun its eight-year worldwide partnership with the Olympic & Paralympic Movements. It said this on Sunday in a statement titled ‘Allianz begins eight-year worldwide Olympic & Paralympic partnership’. The Chief Executive Officer, Allianz SE, Oliver Bäte, said, “Allianz is proud to be the ‘Worldwide insurance partner of the Olympic & Paralympic Movements’. “As a supporter of the sports ecosystem and through shared core values of excellence, friendship, inclusion and respect, Allianz and our 148,000 employees and 100,000 agents are excited to care and deliver for athletes, their families and their ambitions.” The insurer said it had engaged fans, athletes, teams and employees across four pilot markets, namely Australia, China, France and Spain. Allianz said it presented the Australian Olympic Committee’s Wellbeing Week to showcase ways to improve mental health. It said it also worked with the Organising Committee Olympic Games Paris 2024 to encourage people to walk and run for ‘Club Paris 2024’, an initiative to move and be part of the games.
