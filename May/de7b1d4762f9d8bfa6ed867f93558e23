The Chief Imam of Ibadan, Sheikh AbdulGaniyu Agbotomokekere, on Wednesday led hundreds of Muslims in Eid prayer at the Ibadan Central Eid Praying Ground, Agodi, Oyo State. The Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar had late Tuesday directed that fasting should continue on Wednesday. The Sultan who is the President-General of the National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs said Eid-Fitri would hold on Thursday due to non sighting of the moon on Tuesday. But the Chief Imam of Ibadan was said to have announced that Ramadan ended on Tuesday and Wednesday would be Eid. Some  prominent Muslim in Ibadan were reportedly absent at the Eid ground, but the Deputy Governor, Rauf Olaniyan; and the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the South-West, Taofeeq Arapaja, among others, attended the prayer session. When contacted on the telephone, Agbotomokekere told our correspondent that he led the Eid prayer on Wednesday because the moon was eventually sighted late on Tuesday. The son on the imam, Abdulrahman, who answered the call on behalf of his father, said the moon was sighted in Kebbi State and the Sultan was told, but he said he could not reverse himself having given the directive that Ramadan fast should continue on Wednesday. He said, “Yes, we performed Eid today and it was quite fine. (Taofeek) Arapaja was there, the  deputy governor ( Rauf Olaniyan) was  there, as well as many other politicians. “They sighted the moon in Kebbi. Shiek Usman Dahiru of Bauchi called Sultan that the moon had been sighted. But the Sultan was said to have told him that he had announced that Eid would hold on Thursday and that he could not reverse that.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
