Midtjylland midfielder Frank Onyeka is eager to seal his place in the Super Eagles midfield after he was handed a recall back to the team seven months after his debut, The PUNCH reports. The impressive midfielder was selected alongside Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo, Shehu Abdulahi and Abraham Marcus for the friendly against Cameroon on June 4 in Austria. Onyeka debuted for the Eagles in their 1-0 loss to Algeria in an international friendly last October, but hopes to take his chances in the upcoming friendly. “I missed the Sierra Leone game (AFCON qualifier) last November due to injury but I hope to use this opportunity to impress,” Onyeka told The PUNCH. “There are some very good players in my position in the team and it’s going to be a battle to get into the squad. “Playing well with the team will give me a good chance of making the squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and the World Cup next year.” Onyeka made 41 appearances, scoring four goals and providing four assists in the outgoing season.
