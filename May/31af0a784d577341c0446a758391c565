THE founder of a socio-cultural group, Kiriji Heritage Defenders, Oba Adetoyese Olakisan, has cautioned the Federal Government against intimidating promoters of a new Yoruba nation. He warned that attacks on individuals engaged in the legitimate struggle for self-determination, had the potential of leading to chaos. Olakisan issued the warning on behalf of the group, in a statement, in Osogbo, on Sunday. He enjoined fellow traditional rulers in Yorubaland to meet and take a position on the way forward for the Yoruba race in order to find lasting solutions to the insecurity bedeviling the nation. The statement read in part, “The issue of Oodua Republic should be considered and deliberated upon by the Obas, and they should come up with a position that will either put to rest or energize the agitation for the Oodua nation. “When some people are trying to send herdsmen that are destroying our farms and raping our women away from our land, some Obas are still busy giving them lands and chieftaincy titles. How many Yoruba indigene can get such land in the north? “We in Kiriji Heritage Defenders also warn the Federal Government against the use of security agencies to harass arrow heads of Yoruba agitation for Oodua nation. “Prof. Akintoye, Sunday Adeyemo, Igboho, Dr. Kunle Olajide, our traditional rulers, myself and others should not be targeted because of our stand regarding the position of Yoruba nation in the country called Nigeria, as doing that will escalate tension.” Copyright PUNCH.
