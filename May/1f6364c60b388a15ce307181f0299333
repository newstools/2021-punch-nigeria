The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday, said the multiple challenges facing Nigeria were surmountable only when citizens come together as one. He said this while extending his best wishes to all Nigerians and Muslims across the globe as they observe the Eid-el Fitr. In a statement issued on Wednesday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘On the occasion of Eid, President Buhari calls for unity and solidarity,’ the President said, “On this blessed occasion, I wish that the Eid festival brings with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst all. “Unity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one. “It is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages. “We should jointly pray against the tragic incidents of kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of our country as a united entity. “We must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion.” Buhari noted that it was satisfying to see Christians breaking fast and, in some cases, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithful during the Ramadan fast. “This model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities. These are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,” added. The President also urged Nigerians to keep observing all COVID-19 prevention measures and celebrate responsibly.
