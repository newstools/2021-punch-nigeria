Joy Bishara, one of the 57 Chibok girls, who escaped Boko Haram attacks on the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, has said she will always visit Nigeria, despite her forays in the United States. She made this known to The PUNCH, in a video interview on Tuesday evening. Early this month, she and her friend, Lydia Porgu, who also escaped from the terrorists by jumping off the high truck where over 200 girls were being whisked away from their school in the dead of the night on April 14, 2014, recently graduated from universities in the United States. The former studied social works, whereas the latter studied legal studies. When asked if she’d be coming to Nigeria anytime soon, Bishara said, “There’s no place like home. Nigeria is my home, no matter the number of years I spend in the US. I will always visit though I have security concerns. But, that doesn’t mean I won’t visit.” She also made it clear that she was having a flourishing career as a social worker and is thankful to God for saving her life on that fateful day. According to Aljazeera, as of 14 April 2021, seven years after the initial kidnapping, over 100 of the girls remain missing. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
