The Edo State Internal Revenue Service is set to embark on a name and shame campaign of defaulting taxpayers in the state. The Executive Chairman of EIRS, ‘Nidu Inneh, in a statement said the list included owners of hotels, bars, eateries, restaurants, trade associations, as well as lawyers, architects, medical professionals and school proprietors. Inneh added that many high net-worth individuals and contractors faced the risk of prosecution for tax evasion. He said, “We have resolved to embark on a name and shame campaign, as many proprietors who run viable businesses in the state are culpable for tax avoidance and evasion.” The EIRS boss noted that the state government was committed to ensuring that tax defaulters were brought to book, adding that a number of gas plant operators and petrol station owners fell in the category of those who had not been faithful with settling their tax obligations.
