The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Port Harcourt Zonal Office, has arrested the leader of a syndicate involved in the buying and selling of human organs for trafficking to foreigners. The leader identified as Ukaeje John Emeka (alias Dr. Phil Mark, Dr. Donald Phillip, Dr. Wesley David), was arrested on April 16, 2021, at Rumukparali, Ozuoba, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He was arrested by operatives of the Commission based on established intelligence on his suspicious fraudulent internet dealings. According to a statement on the Commission’s website, “Preliminary investigations by the EFCC showed that the suspect is leading a syndicate of fraudsters falsely presenting themselves as medical doctors, with a human organ bank, particularly kidneys for sale and purchase. “Victims of the syndicate include people with renal disease and even healthy people desirous of selling their organs in Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and United Arab Emirate. “Items recovered from the suspect include one Nigerian passport, one Republic of Cote D’Ivoire passport, nine ATM cards, one black-coloured HP laptop, one gold-coloured Tecno L9 plus phone, one gold-coloured Samsung Galaxy J8 and one ash-coloured Lexus ES 330 salon car.” The Commission added that it is on the trail of other members of the syndicate within and outside Nigeria.
