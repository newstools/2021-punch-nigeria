The Niger Delta Power Holding Company has increased its electricity substations to 22, as six of its power generating plants now contribute about 3,400 megawatts to the national grid. NDPHC, a key intervention agency in the power sector, disclosed this in its latest National Integrated Power Project report from 2015 to 2021. According to the report, the NIPP programme is currently in its second phase and traverses transmission, distribution and renewable energy projects. In the first phase, the NDPHC, owned by the three tiers of government, started with the construction of 10 gas-fired power plants. The report said six of the NIPP power plants now generate and supply about 3,400MW of electricity to the national grid, while the four other plants were still under construction, as some of their turbines had been operating partially. NDPHC stated that from 2015 to 2019, it completed 2,194km of 330 kilovolt and 887km 132kV transmission lines. “Also, the country now has 10 new 330/132kV substations and eight 132/33kV substations connected to the national grid. These have added 5,590MVA/330kV and 3,493MVA/132kV capacity levels, respectively,” it said. The company noted that from June 2019 to January 2021, its transmission department completed four new substations, boosting the grid’s capacity further by 180MVA (Awka and Nkalagu substations). It said the Ihiala and Orlu GIS substations had been completed with a total 120MVA capacity, but the company had to wait for other associated projects to be fixed before the substations could be connected to the grid. The report added that all NDPHC transmission projects were at an average of 80 per cent completion stage. It said the projects had supported in the reduction of the Aggregate Technical, Collection and Commercial losses in the sector and had improved on the industry’s health, safety and environment. For electricity distribution, the report said the company had completed over 360 injection substations with a combined capacity of about 3,540MW. “It has also built about 2,600km of 11kV power distribution lines and 4,600km of 33kV distribution lines which directly supply electricity to transformers in residential areas,” the report said.
