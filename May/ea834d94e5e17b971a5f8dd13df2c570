The Lagos State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps, Mr Eddy Megwa, has advised the 2021 Batch A stream II corps members to focus on building the nation for greater exploits. Megwa who spoke to The PUNCH after the swearing-in ceremony of the corps members on Friday at Iyana-Ipaja camp, said a total number of 1,061 females and 472 males participated in the ceremony. Megwa also charged the corps members not to be money-conscious. He said, “Get yourselves ready for national service, this is not the time to talk about money, to talk about personal conveniences, this is the time to make obvious sacrifices for Nigeria and see how we can advance this country to a better developing country. “They are good to serve and ready, like their predecessors, they are young Nigerians dreaming to serve their father land for one year, you can see the dedication in them and agility to contribute their quota.” He said none of the 1533 corps members who were sworn-in on Friday tested positive to coronavirus. “For you to have access to the orientation camp, you must go through the COVID-19 test, we are using the rapid test and the result comes out in less than 10 minutes. It is only when you are cleared that you get into camp, we have a zero record in the area of COVID-19. All the corps members have all been negative,” he said. In order to avoid overcrowding, he hinted that he was expecting a total of 2,300 corps members, adding that they would arrive in batches till Monday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
