The Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, Professor Bolaji Owasanoye, has described corruption as Nigeria’s greatest challenge at the moment. He also said corruption could be directly linked to festering insecurity, economic decline and poverty. Owasanoye, who spoke at a capacity-building workshop for members of the House of Representatives Committee on Anti-Corruption in Abuja, stressed that corruption was responsible for all the negative indices the country had suffered in recent times. “Corruption is the enemy of development and good governance. Corruption is Nigeria’s greatest challenge and is directly associated with national security challenges, current economic decline, poverty expansion, reduced life expectancy, high mortality and deteriorating livelihood experienced by citizens,” he said He urged Nigerians to help tackle this impending problem through concerted efforts from both state and non-state actors for a better Nigeria. The ICPC chairman also encouraged the National Assembly to deploy its power over government agencies and departments to effectively curb corruption in the public sector. Owasanoye noted, “The fight against corruption is our collective responsibility and not the duty of the government alone. We must visualise the type of country and environment that we want to live in and bequeath to generations yet unborn. “We have an objective to reduce corruption in our lifetime to such an extent that it can no longer threaten our collective well-being, peace, development. The legislature can lead us to our collective vision through its constitutional mandate.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
