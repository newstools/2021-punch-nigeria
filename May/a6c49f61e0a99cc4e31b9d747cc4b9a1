The late Afrobeat legend, Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, popularly known as Fela Kuti, has lost out on the race to be inducted into the 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The late musician was nominated alongside international artistes like Tina Turner, The Go-Go’s, Iron Maiden, Foo Fighters, Jay-Z, Dionne Warwick, and Carole King. This was the first time the late legend had ever been nominated for the induction, but he lost to Tina Turner at the Fan Vote Final Fans’ Ballot. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame revealed its 2021 inductees on Wednesday, marking the most diverse group by musical genre in the organization’s history. To be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame, an individual artist or band must have released its first commercial recording at least 25 years before the year of nomination. For the performer’s category, Foo Fighters, The Go-Go’s, JAY-Z, Carole King, Todd Rundgren and Tina Turner were inducted. The Ahmet Ertegun Award went to Clarence Avant, while Singers like LL Cool J, Billy Preston and Randy Rhoads got the Musical Excellence Award. For the Early Influence Award, Kraftwerk, Gil Scott Heron, and Charley Patton were recipients. “This diverse class of talented inductees reflects the Hall’s ongoing commitment to honour artists whose music created the sound of youth culture,” John Sykes, chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation said in a statement. This will be the second trip to the Rock Hall for three of this year’s inductees. Foo Fighter’s frontman Dave Grohl got his first Rock Hall induction with Nirvana in 2014. Turner was welcomed into the Hall in 1991 as a member of Ike and Tina Turner, and King has held a spot with songwriter Gerry Goffin since 1990. This time around Turner and King will be honoured for their solo careers. The 36th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony will take place on Saturday, October 30, 2021.
