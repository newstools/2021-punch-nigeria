Rangers manager Steven Gerrard has revealed he has been receiving advice from Sir Alex Ferguson. Gerrard was named the Scottish Football Writers’ Association’s top manager following his title success with Rangers, their first top-flight title since 2011. Ferguson, who grew up a Rangers fan and played for the club, this week spoke of how impressed he has been by Gerrard’s performance as manager. “Oh, he’s done magnificent,” Ferguson told The Guardian. “He really has, both on and off the field. A press interview can lose you your job in management. “But Steven’s press conferences are fantastic. He’s cool, he’s composed, he gives the right answers. He’s really top because it’s an art.” Former Liverpool captain Gerrard responded by saying he was “humbled” to received such praise from such an “iconic figure”. “Through no fault of our own we became big, big rivals at Liverpool and Manchester United, the two biggest clubs in British football,” he said. “We were massive rivals for many years and he’s someone that even though he was a rival I looked up to him immensely because he is such an iconic figure in the game. What he achieved in the game is up there with the very best who have ever lived. So I’m really flattered and humbled by his words.”
