THE Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Faisal Shuaib, on Tuesday said it was not clear yet when the Federal Government would take delivery of next batch of COVID-19 vaccines. Shuaib said this in Abuja during a press conference organised to update the public on the status of COVID-19 vaccination. He said, “While we have information that we may get the next consignment of vaccines by end of July or August, this has not been officially confirmed. “When we are able to, we will provide an update regarding timelines and updates of the next shipment. At present, we do not have that information available due to the wider context we are in.” Speaking further, Shuaib said, “The International Monetary Fund is now advocating a $50bn fund to be spent on ensuring a faster rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and is calling for at least, 40 per cent of the global population to be vaccinated by the end of this year, and at least 60 per cent by June 2022.” Copyright PUNCH.
