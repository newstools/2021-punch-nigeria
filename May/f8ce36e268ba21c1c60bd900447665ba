A fatal crash involving two vehicles on the old Ado Ekiti-Iyin Ekiti Road in Ekiti State, on Wednesday, claimed the life of a woman. The crash involved a Toyota Previa car and a Toyota bus heading in opposite directions, which collided and burst into flames. Sources gave conflicting reports on the fatality and the number of the injured, but one of them, who said he was among early road users to get to the scene, said, “A woman in the bus died, while another passenger, who was injured, was rushed to a hospital in Iyin Ekiti. “Two vehicles collided and immediately caught fire. One passenger, a woman, died in the bus, while one other person, who sustained injuries, escaped death. The injured person was rushed to hospital for medical attention.” It took some time before the road was cleared for the use of other motorists. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Sunday Abutu, who confirmed the accident, said one person died in the crash. Abutu said, “Only one person died. The woman got trapped in the bus after the collision and sympathisers could not rescue her in time. When the vehicle went up in flames, the people were helpless and the woman got burnt to death in the process. “However, the second person, who got wounded in the same vehicle, is at present receiving treatment in hospital. We appeal to road users to be mindful of their speed while driving on roads. They should obey all rules guiding driving to avert carnage and untimely death of people.” Copyright PUNCH.
