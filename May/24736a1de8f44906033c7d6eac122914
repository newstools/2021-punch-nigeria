Two former students of the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu, have graduated from the Southeastern University, Florida, United States of America. Both girls, who were among the 276 female students captured by Boko Haram in 2014, escaped while were being transported by their abductors. The duo were later given scholarships by the United States Government, and they graduated on April 30. While Bishara earned a degree in Social Work, Pogu bagged a degree in Legal Studies. During an interview on ABC Good Morning America, the two girls said they had vowed never to return to school due to the insecurity in the North-East. The ladies expressed excitement about their degrees, saying they hoped to further their studies. The TV station later announced a donation of $5,000 gift cards for each of the girls to go on a shopping spree. While the Federal Government has negotiated the release of some of the other abducted Chibok girls, 112 of them are still reported to be in captivity. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
