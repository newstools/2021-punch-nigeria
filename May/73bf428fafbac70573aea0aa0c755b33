ABIA State Police Command has confirmed that over 100 gunmen razed a police station in Bende Local Government Area of the state Wednesday night. The latest attack on a police station in the state came barely six hours after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu left Bende LGA headquarters after a civic reception in honour of the immediate past House of Representatives member representing Bende Federal Constituency, Nnenna Ukeje. The attack also came just few hours after the office of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in Amaekpu, Ohafia LGA, was burnt. Sources who witnessed the incident that happened at about 10.45pm disclosed that suspects detained at the station were freed by the gunmen. The affected police station is situated at the outer gate of the council headquarters and about 10 meters from the LGA field where the occasion held. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Ogbonna Geoffrey, disclosed that two police operatives were shot on the leg, while the generator house and multipurpose house of the council headquarters were torched. The police image maker revealed that three motorcycles and a Toyota Highlander belonging to the DPO of the police station were among vehicles set ablaze. According to another source, a group of soldiers later arrived at the area to restore normalcy. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
