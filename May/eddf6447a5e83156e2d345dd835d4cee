She said, “I am incredibly proud that through FATE Foundation we have disseminated values of integrity and resilience, and a culture of enterprise, innovation, and solutions. “FATE businesses are solutions to economic problems and gaps in the market. FATE entrepreneurs are distinguished by their resilience and their sense of community.” The report summarised the impacts of the past, present, and future of FATE Foundation.
