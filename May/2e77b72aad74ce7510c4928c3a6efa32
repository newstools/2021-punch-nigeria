FORMER Cross River State Governor, Liyel Imoke has said the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party remains intact despite the exit of the Governor of the State, Ben Ayade. He said the governor made a mistake to opt for the All Progressives Congress which he said was already collapsing. Imoke said this at the stakeholders’ meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party, held at Transcorp Hotel, Calabar, on Sunday. He said, “APC is a party that is collapsing. It is not a place to go for Cross River. We will revive the glory of Cross River. I took risks to see the emergence of this government. They even accused me of collecting money. It is an insult.” “I have been a governor and I served my people diligently. Now, we have seen a different approach to governance. It is not democratic. Our politics is sweet. We don’t play politics of harassment and intimidation.” Imoke said Cross River is still PDP and the movement of one man does not change that fact. He said the party will be handed over to youths in 2023. “We want youths that can deliver. Time has come for a generational shift. The next governor (of Cross River State) will be a man of character. The next national and state assembly members will be men of character.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
