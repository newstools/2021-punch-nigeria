The Imo State Police Command has arrested two members of a dreaded syndicate, who specialised in robbing banks within and outside the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, who confirmed the development to our correspondent, said the breakthrough was part of the mandate given to the command by the acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to restore normalcy and apprehend all the “recalcitrant criminal elements, who are making lives of innocent people unbearable.” He said the suspects were apprehended in Eziobodo community, Owerri West Local Government Area of the state. The CP stated, “The arrest was made on Tuesday, May 11, 2021, by police operatives attached to the Operation Puff Adder II following information received from members of the vigilante group of Eziobodo community about the presence of deadly armed criminals, who specialised in robbery operations in the state and beyond. “The police operatives quickly mobilised to their hideout and on arrival, they were engaged by the hoodlums, but the operatives responded promptly and dislodged the criminals. As a result, two members of the deadly gang were arrested, while others escaped with gunshot wounds. “Exhibits recovered at the scene include one AK-47 rifle with breech number 0544 and two magazines containing two rounds of live ammunition. Also, a bag containing military handkerchief and camouflage T- shirt was recovered from the scene. “On interrogation, both suspects confessed to be members of the deadly armed robbery syndicate, who had been carrying out bank robberies across the state and beyond. The suspects have also mentioned some of their partners in crime, who are now on the radar of the police.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
