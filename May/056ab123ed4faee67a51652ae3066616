Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested two members of a robbery gang, who allegedly specialised in snatching motorcycles in Sango-Ota, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of the state. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Oyeyemi gave the names of the suspects as Abiodun Ogundele, 23, and Opeyemi Olatubosun, 22. He said they were arrested following a distress call received at the Sango Divisional Police Headquarters around 8pm that one Adesoji David, a motorcyclist, was being attacked at the Joju area of Sango-Ota by some hoodlums. Oyeyemi stated, “Upon the distress call, the DPO, Sango-Ota, CSP Godwin Idehai, quickly mobilised his men and moved to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the suspects, who had already snatched the victim’s Bajaj motorcycle, took to flight, but were hotly chased and two among them were arrested, while the other one escaped. “Recovered from them are one locally-made pistol, one live cartridge, one expended cartridge and the snatched motorcycle.” The PPRO said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation. “The CP also directed that the fleeing member of the gang be hunted and brought to justice as soon as possible,” Oyeyemi added.
