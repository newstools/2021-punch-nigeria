NEWSPAPER vendors and distribution agents on Tuesday protested their continued harassment by the operatives of the Intelligence Response Team of the Inspector General of Police in Imo state. They also refused to distribute and sell Tuesday’s edition of newspapers in the state. The vendors insisted that until one of their members held by the security operatives was released, they would not return to work. Recall that the IGP team had on Monday morning swooped on the newspaper vendors and distribution agents on Rotibi Street, Douglas Road, Owerri, confiscated many newspapers copies and arrested five of them. The state Chairman of Imo Newspaper Distribution Agents, Chidiebere Tasie, said they would not go back to the newspaper stands until their remaining member who was still being held in police custody was released. “We will open for business until the remaining member of the association is freed by the police,” he stressed.
