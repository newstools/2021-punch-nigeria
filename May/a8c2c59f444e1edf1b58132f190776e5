The Confederation of African Athletics Region II Championships will take place in Kaduna from May 29 to 30, Sunday PUNCH reports. This was contained in a statement released by CAA Region II, which was made available to our correspondent on Saturday. CAA Region II president, Ibrahim Gusau, confirmed this in a chat with journalists in Accra, Ghana. Gusau said maximum security will be made available for countries competing in the event. The event was scheduled to hold in 2020 but was postponed due to COVID-19. The statement said 10 countries out of the 15 in the region have already signified their interest to take part in the competition. The competition comes after the Algerian government announced the postponement of the African Athletics Championships on Wednesday over COVID-19 concerns. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
