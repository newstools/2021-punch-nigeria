Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc said on Thursday that it maintained its dividend at $0.10 per share for the financial year 2020 despite the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Nigerian independent energy company said it had returned $344m to shareholders in the form of dividends since 2014. Its Chairman, Dr Ambrosie Orjiako, said at the company’s hybrid 8th Annual General Meeting said Seplat’s cash position remained strong in the full-year of 2020, adding that the $318m of cash it generated from operations was significantly more than the $150m invested for future growth. He said, “The company’s capital expenditure in the 2020 business year was higher than the $125m spent in 2019, which demonstrates the company’s commitment to growth; as it voluntarily repaid $100m of its Revolving Credit Facility and ended the year with $225m in cash and net debt of $440m. “The company’s average working interest production was 51,183boepd, including 33,714bopd of liquids and 101MMscfd gas (17,469boepd). Our financial performance enabled us to maintain our commitment to paying dividends. “While other companies were cutting back or cancelling payments for the 2019 financial year, because of prevailing uncertainties, we honoured our commitment and paid a final dividend of $0.05, for a total dividend of $0.10 for 2019.” Orjiako said the company had in October 2020 announced an interim dividend of $0.05, adding that the board had since approved an additional top-up of $0.05. “Since we raised $535m at our initial public offering in May 2014, we have returned $344m to shareholders in the form of dividends,” he added. The company adopted Seplat Energy as its new name following the passage of the resolution at its AGM. The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Roger Brown, said the company had created a New Energy unit to focus on lower carbon to zero carbon fuel sources. “The natural extension beyond gas is for Seplat to participate in renewable energy, such as solar power, and in emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage. Our view is that Nigeria will benefit from being able to deploy renewable energy on its electricity grid rather than solely developing an off grid renewable solution,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
