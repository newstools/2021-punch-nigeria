The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit on Monday gave all squatters at Iganmu under-bridge (White Sand) a three-day ultimatum to remove all illegal structures, trucks and vehicles in the area. A statement on Monday by the Public Affairs Officer of the unit, Femi Moliki, quoted the Chairman of the agency, CSP Shola Jejeloye, as saying the owners of the illegal structures, abandoned trucks and shanties must remove them and vacate the area within the stipulated date given to them. Jejeloye said the move became necessary in view of the rising incidences of traffic robberies around the area and environmental nuisance caused by the squatters. The chairman said, “The government is worried by the squalid environment and that it is serving as hideouts for criminals, who daily dispossess road users of their valuables every now and then, adding that the present nature of the environment allows criminals to escape police arrest.” The task force boss said the state government was committed to reducing the traffic incidence around Ijora and Apapa, adding that all bottlenecks to the policy must be removed. Jejeloye said, “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s newly-signed Executive Order on traffic and sanitation declared zero tolerance for environmental abuse, illegal and indiscriminate dumping of refuse and defacing the environment. I can assure you that government would enforce this notice on Thursday.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
