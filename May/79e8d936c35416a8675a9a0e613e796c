The Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission on Saturday conducted elections into all the 33 local government councils in the state. The exercise was peaceful in many areas but it witnessed low turnout due to voter apathy and the light shower recorded in some parts of the state. The election was peaceful in many areas in Ibadan but our correspondent who went round observed that many voters shunned polling units and used the period for some other things. Youths were seen playing football on the streets in Agbowo and the turnout of voters was not impressive in the area.  But it was gathered that turnout was okay in Saki East and Saki West local government areas and few other places in the state. But some  hoodlums reportedly snatched a ballot box at Unit 3 Ward 2 at Aaje Ogunbado area in the Ogbomoso North Local Government Area. Also at Ward 5 in Eruwa in the Ibarapa East Local Government Area, it was gathered that trouble started at around  noon and some youths made bonfires on the road. The incident caused panic but normalcy was said to be eventually restored. The Chairman of OYSIEC, Isiaka Olagunju ( SAN) announced the suspension of election in Ido Local Government Area following the omission of the logo of the Zenith Labour Party on the ballot papers for the area.
