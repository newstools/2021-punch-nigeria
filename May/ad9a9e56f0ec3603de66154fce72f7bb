Masuga village, near Kontagora town, headquarters of the Kontagora Local Government Area of Niger State, was thrown into confusion on Wednesday as bandits shot the son of the emir, Alhaji Bashar Namaska, dead in his father’s farm. The deceased was said to be in his father’s farm along Zuru Road when he was gunned down. Apart from the emir’s son, some of the people working with him in the farm were also said to have been shot dead by the bandits, who rustled unspecified number of cattle in the farm. The bandits also waylaid commercial and private vehicles plying the road, collected their phones, money and other valuables. They beat up those without cash and valuables and took others away. The late Bashar, who was the Sardauna of Kontagora, had been holding forth for his father, Sarkin Sudan, Alhaji Saidu Namaska, who had been sick for the past months. A source in government said, “It is true that shot several people and killed the emir’s son, Alhaji Bashar. “His death will be formerly announced today (Thursday) and he will also be buried immediately.” Efforts to speak to the state Police Public Relations Officer prove abortive as all calls and text messages to his line were not returned. Similarly, bandits on Thursday invaded Kwakwashi community in Niger State, killing one person, abducting 13 others. It was gathered that the bandits numbering about 30 arrived at the community around midnight. Our correspondent learnt that the bandits shot repeatedly into the air while the operation lasted. A woman, who did not want her name in print, said her husband was kidnapped after the bandits destroyed their door and window to gain access into their house. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
