The Caretaker Committee of the Nigeria Cricket Federation has inaugurated the Accelerated Growth Programme to spread the game to a targeted 250,000 youths through a grassroots development plan. Chairman of the NCF Caretaker Committee, Prof Yahaya Ukwenya, said at the programme’s inauguration on Children’s Day in Abuja that the event was a continuation of the initiative of the last board. “We had an outlined growth plan that we stuck to. Facility was one of the core of our attention while the four year-tenure lasted, and we are at the tail end of it before the board was dissolved. This programme is actually a continuation of the plan.” He said the outcome of the plan meant that the country now has three cities with two world-class cricket pitches each, namely Lagos, Abuja and Benin City. “This phase of development is meant to complement the facilities that is now in place,” Ukwenya added. He said the inauguration of the Accelerated Growth Programme was meant to bring everything together. “We have employed 37 field officers across the states and 2, 000 starters kids for the officers to run the game.” Over 100 kids were involved in the exhibition game that launched the event on Thursday in Abuja, while the programme will be deployed through the Regional Development Officers across the country.
