The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has urged disputing parties in the ongoing political crisis in Mali to settle their differences and unite for the peace and unity of the country. Buhari made this call at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Friday while receiving his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, who serves as a Special Envoy and ECOWAS mediator to Mali. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement titled, ‘President Buhari, Jonathan confer on the crisis in Mali.’ The statement read, “President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja called on the actors in the political crisis in Mali to come together for the peace and unity of the country. “The President spoke when he received in audience former President Goodluck Jonathan, who is Special Envoy and ECOWAS mediator to the West African country.” The statement also quoted the President as saying that “a situation where most parts of the country are in the hands of insurgents calls for a consensus and restoration of peace, not a further escalation of the crisis.” Jonathan reportedly briefed the President on the current situation in Mali after meeting with the key political actors ahead of the meeting of ECOWAS leaders under the Chairmanship of President Nana Akufo-Addo of the Republic of Ghana. He added that the meeting of the regional leaders was necessary to urgently find an acceptable solution to the current impasse in the West African nation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
