The Nigerian Medical Association has thrown its weight behind the Senate and the federal Ministry of Health on plans to ban importation of syringes and needles in the country A joint senate committee on Health and Trade and Investment are jointly probing a petition by the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, the producers of syringes and needles. The association had in its petition, alleged that government at all tiers were not patronising them but were embracing foreign syringes and needles, a development which prompted the senate joint committee to invite the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, to appear before it. The NMA President, Innocent Ujah, said, “What the senate is doing with regard to the complaints by syringe and needle manufacturers  is within their area of jurisdiction .Whenever  they finish the process,the better for Nigeria “We believe by addressing the complaints, it will stimulate local production and create wealth as well as generate employment if we have many syringe and needle production companies in Nigeria.” Ujah also condemned the alleged proliferation of substandard health products and other equipment in the country.
