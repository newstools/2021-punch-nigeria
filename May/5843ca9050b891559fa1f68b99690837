Actress, Bimbo Ademoye, has cautioned filmmakers in the country to stop taking every movie to the cinema. According to the talented thespian, not every movie was worthy of being shown in cinemas. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, she said, “I am a perfectionist. I am the type of person that can make a movie worth millions and would still think it is not cinema worthy. I am not one to decide what film makes it to the cinema but I can tell you films that should not make it to the cinemas. Don’t disrespect that space. Don’t say because you have cameras and actors, you just take it and let people waste their money, time and energy at the cinemas. Some movies are better watched at home. That is being greedy. At the end of the day, the filmmakers end up stressing themselves because Nigerians know what is good. They would not tell people to go and watch a movie that is not good.” When asked if she had ever been disappointed at not winning an award, Ademoye said, “Of course, I am human. I had anticipated winning an award twice. But, has that stopped me? Absolutely not! Would I keep working harder? Absolutely yes.” Reacting to the notion that she had had a swift rise in Nollywood, she said, “I don’t know if I have an answer to that. I would just say I am doing my thing. I am on my lane and I am going to keep going. I am not stopping anytime soon. Am I where I want to be? Absolutely not. Am I thankful for where I am? Definitely.” The actress also stated that she considered every day to be a high point. She said, “Every day is a high point. Getting the Eko Star Film and TV Awards was huge. It was not even a nomination but  a recognition. Every day is a step further for me.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
