No fewer than 150 beggars have been arrested in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, in the last two days. The Chairman, Federal Capital Territory Administration Ministerial Taskforce on City Sanitation, Mr Ihkaro Attah, who disclosed this to journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, said the beggars were arrested as part of efforts to enhance security in the territory. He added that the task force and other relevant agencies arrested the beggars during combined operations in Abuja. Attah said, “Those apprehended were taken to the Bwari Area Council Centre for rehabilitation. The FCT has a functional rehabilitation and training centre for such persons. “Sadly, very few of them stay there and get full rehabilitation; many find their way to run and sometimes they request to be allowed to go back to their states. “But what is fundamental is that some of these persons are being brought by other persons into the FCT. You will see young people leading blind aged men; we felt that is not what the city should be.” Attah said the FCT authorities were targeting those who always brought the beggars into Abuja from different states. He said such people would be apprehended and prosecuted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
