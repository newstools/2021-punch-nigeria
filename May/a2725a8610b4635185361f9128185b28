As part of measures to grow revenue and attract investors to the mining industry, the Federal Government in collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation on Monday unveiled a policy document on gold mining in Nigeria. UNIDO alongside Nigeria’s ministries of environment, mines and steel development, as well as health jointly unveiled the National Action Plan for the Reduction and Eventual Elimination of Mercury Use in the Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining sector in Nigeria. The parties also unveiled the National Policy on Solid Waste Management as well as National Policy on Plastic Waste Management at the event in Abuja. The Regional Director and UNIDO Representative to ECOWAS, UNIDO Regional Hub Nigeria, Jean Bakole, said the policy document was an obligation for Nigeria, as a party under the Minamata Convention and would help drive investments in the mining sector. He said, “This plan will provide Nigeria with current data and an up-to-date situation analysis of gold mining in Nigeria, the document will also appeal to both local and foreign investors. “More importantly, it has mapped out a way forward for gold mining and its associated mercury management in Nigeria. “The NAP has developed the national strategy on gold mining in Nigeria and its associated mercury use by facilitating formalisation, access to finance, among others.” The Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said numerous challenges were preventing the effective growth of the mining and waste sectors.
