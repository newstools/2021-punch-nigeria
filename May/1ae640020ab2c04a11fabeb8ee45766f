The Bauchi Emirate Council has suspended indefinitely the Wakilin Birnin Bauchi (Representative of Bauchi), Yakubu Abdullahi, a member of the House of Representatives, over his “disrespect” for the emir and the State Governor, Bala Mohammed. Abdullahi was elected a member of the National Assembly representing Bauchi Federal Constituency on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party before dumping the party three months ago for the All Progressives Congress. The suspension was contained in a letter addressed to the federal lawmaker, signed by Nasiru Maidala, on behalf of the Secretary of the Council. A copy of the suspension letter, which was obtained by our correspondent on Sunday, was written in Hausa, dated 16th May, 2021, and titled, ‘Letter of suspension as traditional title holder of Wakilin Birni’ with Reference No. BEC/ADM/20/VOL.X. The letter read in parts, “Bauchi Emirate Council in its meeting presided by His Royal Highness, the Emir (Alhaji Rilwan Suleiman Adamu), deliberated deeply on your actions which are considered as disrespectful to the Emir, his Council members, District Heads and other traditional leaders of the emirate. “The meeting cited how you came before the emir who was seated with the governor with Alkyabba and Kandiri (Royal Gown and traditional staff) which you were admonished to remove. “The Council will not condone such disrespect and because of that, you are hereby suspended from being the Wakilin Birni of Bauchi, indefinitely.” Efforts by our correspondent to get a reaction from the suspended traditional title holder proved abortive as he did not pick calls put across to him, even as his phone was later switched off.
