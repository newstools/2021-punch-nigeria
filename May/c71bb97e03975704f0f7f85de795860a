The Director-General of the National Identity Management Commission, Prof. Aziz Aliyu, has said 56 million Nigerians have been registered into the NIMC database with their National Identity Number. He disclosed this on Monday at the virtual launch of a new national policy and four digital projects. “As of today, NIMC has been able to register 56 million Nigerians with their NIN and that has been possible since Dr Isa Pantami took over as Minister of Communications and Digital Economy in October 2020. We register at least two million Nigerians monthly which is a good effort toward the digital economy agenda,’’ he said. The projects launched were the National Policy on Virtual Engagements in Federal Public Institutions; Emergency Communications Centre in Akure, Ondo State; and Digital Economy Centre at the Federal University, Gashua, Yobe State, Delta State University, Abraka, and Government Secondary School, Rigasa, Kaduna State.
