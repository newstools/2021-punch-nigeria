The Ogun State chapter of the  Oodua People’s Congress, affiliated to the Are Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Aare Gani Adams, says it is ready to provide an alternative towards securing lives and property of residents in the  state. The  coordinator of the OPC in the state, Chief Adesina  Jimoh, in a statement on Tuesday, said the congress had   the unabated spate of armed robbery, cultism and in particular, the new trend of “kidnap for money of our kinsmen and women across the three Senatorial district of the state and we are saddened about it.” Jimoh said the most disturbing aspect of this banditry was the seeming ineptitude of the security operatives across all agencies to stop the menace. “Also going by the media reports, it has been established that members of the Fulani ethnic tribe are behind these act of kidnap for ransom for which our people in Ogun state have been subjected to in recent time. While lamenting over the issue, the OPC said, “We are ready to provide an alternative towards securing lives and property of all the Oodua sons and daughters of Ogun State. “We are battle ready to defend the Yoruba people of Ogun State against all acts of subjugation that may be perpetrated in any forms under any guise or name; be it banditry, kidnappings, killings, raping of our girls and women, or herdsmen’s acts of terrorism.” Copyright PUNCH.
