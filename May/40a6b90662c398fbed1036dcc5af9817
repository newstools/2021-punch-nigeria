GOtv subscribers will on Saturday watch the live broadcast of the Emirates FA Cup final match between Chelsea and Leicester City at the iconic Wembley Stadium in London. This year’s Emirates FA Cup final promises to be a cracker as Champions League finalists, Chelsea, seek to confirm their supremacy over the Foxes. Nigerian fans will get to watch in-form Super Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho continue his impressive form for Leicester. Both sides have met 118 times in all competitions since their first clash in 1905. The Blues have claimed 57 wins compared to 27 for the Foxes, while 34 games have been drawn. Chelsea, eight-time winners of the FA Cup (most recently in 2018), will come into this clash with both the historical pedigree and their status as favourites, given the excellent performance under manager, Thomas Tuchel. Leicester, meanwhile, reached the FA Cup final for the first time in more than half a century and will be hoping to win the competition for the first time ever. Chief Customer Officer, Multichoice, Martin Mabutho, said, “The FA Cup is the world’s oldest knockout football competition and we are glad to bring the live action from the final match to our GOtv Max and Jolli customers at no extra cost.” Copyright PUNCH.
