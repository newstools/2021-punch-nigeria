EKITI State Government said on Thursday that the state would continue to cooperate with the Federal Government and abide by the decisions of the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the virus. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Filani Oyebanji, said in Ado Ekiti that the state would continue to emphasise social distancing, personal hygiene and observance of other COVID-19 protocols. Explaining that the state government will also encourage residents to get vaccinated, Oyebanji said, “The state government has continued to limit government meetings to virtual platforms as much as possible while regular temperature check and ‘no mask, no entry policy’ in the public setting, workplace buildings, businesses and places of worship, markets and motor parks are encouraged as part of efforts at keeping the virus at bay in the state. “The restrictions on mass gatherings outside workplace settings with a maximum number of 50 people in an enclosed space for events, including weddings and funerals, is still in force.” Oyebanji solicited the continued support of people in the state for government’s efforts at safeguarding their health and ensuring a healthy environment in the state.
