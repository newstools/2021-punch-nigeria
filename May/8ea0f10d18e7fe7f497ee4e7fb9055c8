The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, said his administration had initiated and sustained inclusive security arrangement that brought all communities in the state into a network to support security agencies. Oyetola stated this on Wednesday while addressing the newly trained special police constable in the state. The governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Wole Oyebamiji, said this was aimed at achieving the security and safety that the residents of the state desired and deserved. Oyetola urged the new 480 constables to approach their duties with the highest level of professionalism. He added, “As you assume duty today, I charge you to always fly the Omoluabi flag that has earned Osun awards and marked its citizens out for distinction in their fields of human endeavour.” Copyright PUNCH.
