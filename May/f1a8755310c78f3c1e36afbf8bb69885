THE Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, on Tuesday raised the alarm that Boko Haram insurgents had started regrouping again in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. He stated this while briefing journalists after plenary on his bill seeking to establish a Federal College of Education in Gwoza, Borno State. The proposed legislation passed second reading on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday. He, however, said the resurgence of Boko Haram activities should not stop the establishment of more education institutions in Borno South. According to Ndume, the area he represents at the National Assembly exists without a higher institution of learning despite its size and population. Ndume said, “Last week, 30 soldiers were killed in Mainok on the highway. Yesterday (Monday), just 30km from Maiduguri, the town was overrun by Boko Haram. It took concerted effort of the armed forces, but we lost a major and two soldiers. In Rann Local Government, the same thing happened. “The problem we are facing in Borno and, to some extent, in Yobe and Adamawa, is that the insurgency is resurging and that is a matter of concern. “Part of the solution is not to give up and not to show the insurgents that Nigerians are overwhelmed but to show that despite their terrorist acts and their stance against western education, more institutions would be established.” On the bill, Ndume said if passed, the establishment of the College of Education would help in transforming the educational fortunes of the people of Borno South.
