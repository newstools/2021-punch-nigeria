The Lagos State Government, through the Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency, has announced the payment of N39.8m to families displaced due to redevelopment. The announcement was made through the stateâ€™s official Twitter handle. It was disclosed that the money was distributed to displaced families in Isale-Gangan Phase I, as well as some allottees at the Adeniji-Adele Housing Estate, whose dilapidated buildings were pulled down to prevent collapse. Speaking at the presentation ceremony, the General Manager of LASURA, Ms Ajibike Shomade, said the terrible state of five blocks at the Adeniji-Adele Estate necessitated the demolition in July 2014 and the implementation of a resettlement plan for the 30 displaced families. Shomade said 12 of the affected families in the estate opted for receipt of annual rent payment while the others opted for resettlement, stressing that the advance rent payment was made to the 12 families in May 2017. On the Isale-Gangan urban upgrade and renewal project, she said nine of the affected families that opted for payment of annual rent in lieu of accommodation received their initial payment in January 2017. Speaking on behalf of the affected families, Alhaji Giwa Bioku thanked the Lagos State Government for the gesture and prayed for the speedy completion of the projects to create better aesthetic value for the area.
