•It’s not true, says Imo govt A former governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has accused his successor, Hope Uzodinma, of clamping down on his supporters for no just cause. Okorocha, levelled the allegations in a statement signed by his Spokesperson, Sam Onwuemeodo, in Owerri, on Tuesday. He alleged that Governor Uzodinma was desperately seeking to link him with the insecurity in the state, hence the attack on his supporters and associates. The statement read in part, “This is to inform the general public that the Government in Imo State, led by Governor Hope Uzodinma, has begun the indiscriminate arrest of Senator Rochas Okorocha’s political associates in the state, using the Anti-kidnapping Squad in the police headquarters. “The government has drafted a list of Okorocha’s political family members and has written petitions against those on the list, claiming that, ‘they are those helping to disorganize the state government. We are yet to know or to be told, what helping to disorganize the state government is all about.” When contacted, the Imo State Commissioner for information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, described Okorocha as “a perennial liar.” Emelumba, said, “ Okorocha is a perennial liar. Is Imo state government the police? It is not true that the petition was written by Imo state government. Any of them who was invited by the police should answer them. What is the involvement of Imo state government? Is Imo state government the police?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
