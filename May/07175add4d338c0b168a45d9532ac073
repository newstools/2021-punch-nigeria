Two farmers living in Oyan, Osun State, Joseph Goje and Nathaniel Goje, have been attacked by suspected herders on their farm at Afoyin village, Erinle, Kwara State. Joseph explained on Sunday that the incident happened around 6pm on Saturday. He said, “Three herders with clubs and cutlasses led their cows to graze on our maize farm and attacked us.” He added that the herders would have killed them, but one of them that escaped called on the people nearby to assist, which made the attackers to flee after they had stabbed the two in the head. “We just told them to leave our farm. Instead of leaving our farm, they attacked us. Nathaniel and I sustained an injury on our heads. “They used the clubs to hit us and left us drenched with blood. But Friday managed to escape and called for help. “We are living in Oyan, in Osun State. The Bororo that attacked us are living on Erin-Ile land. We are afraid of going back to our farm. We have not also reported the matter to the police.” But the Chairman, Osun Committee on Peaceful Coexistence between Fulani/Bororo and the Crop Farmers, Mudashiru Toogun, said his committee was aware of the incident. He said, “I have sent some representatives to visit the place. The incident happened on Kwara land, but the victims are living in Osun. “I also told the victims to report the matter at the nearest police station. If we can identify those herdsmen, we will get across to the Kwara State Government.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
