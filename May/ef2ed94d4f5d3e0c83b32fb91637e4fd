Members of the defunct Mo’hits crew — Don Jazzy, D’Banj, and Wande Coal — reunited to perform at rapper, Ikechuckwu’s wedding recently. Mo’hits Records was founded in 2006 by Michael Collins Ajereh, a.k.a Don Jazzy, and singer Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo, professionally known as D’banj, who was also the first recording artist signed to the label. The group experienced a shakeup when Don Jazzy confirmed via Twitter in March 2012 that D’banj had left the label due to differences in interests. The creation of the Mavin Records by Don Jazzy in May 2012 signalled the end of the Mo’hits crew. The viral video from the wedding showed D’banj and Wande Coal performing the song ‘Iskaba’ by DJ Tunez featuring Wande Coal, while Don Jazzy danced along to the tune on stage. The trio was particularly known for hit songs such as ‘Pere’, ‘Booty Call’, and ‘Move Your Body’. The artistes wowed the star-studded audience which included the likes of Praiz, Omawunmi, Waje, Sasha, Chigurl, and many others.
