Former Super Eagles assistant coach Sylvanus Okpala says Eberechi Eze is the best midfield option for the national team and urged coach Gernot Rohr to grab the Crystal Palace man. The 1980 Africa Cup of Nations winner said Eze, who played for England at youth level, had a lot to offer the Eagles. “I have watched Eze play with his club, he is very good in the midfield. I think the Eagles coach (Rohr) should try and get him to play for Nigeria. He’s the best midfielder we can get at the moment and we should just try our best to make him play for the Eagles,” Okpala said. “Though, I will not subscribe to the officials begging him to play for Nigeria, they should convince him to play for the Eagles just like Leon Balogun, William Troost-Ekong and others who switched their allegiance to play for Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
