Bishop Isaac Oluyamo of Ijesa North Anglican Diocese, Osun State, has said the insecurity in the country is worse than in previous governments. However, he called on Nigerians to unite and work towards ending insurgency threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria. The cleric said this in a speech he presented at the pre-2021 Synod of the diocese held in Ijebu-Jesa. He lamented that Nigerians could no longer sleep with their eyes closed because of the increase in crime rate. Oluyamo said, “It is very unfortunate that this present government, voted into power with the hope that it would find solutions to the problems of this country, is so helpless. “One can even say without mincing words that there is a high rate of insecurity in this government than the previous governments in Nigeria. “The President should declare national fasting and prayer. Nigerians must stand firm and unite against the monster of insecurity because it is a challenge to everyone, not just a group.” The cleric called on the government to restructure the country, saying a lot of things would work better if done.
