Regency Alliance Insurance Plc has said its assets rose by 17.77 per cent to N10.05bn as of the end of 2020 from N8.54bn in 2019. The Chairman, Mr Clem Baiye, disclosed this during the 27th annual general meeting of Regency Alliance in Lagos which was held virtually. “The total assets base of our company grew by 17.77 per cent from N8.53bn in 2019 to N10.05bn in 2020, while the shareholders’ fund stood at N6.32bn at the end of 2020, which is 11.02 per cent higher than the position as at year end 2019,” he said. He disclosed that the company recorded a gross premium income of N3.87bn in 2020, compared to N3.9bn in 2019. The chairman reiterated the company’s commitment to meeting the needs of its insured by ensuring their claims were promptly settled. He said the company recorded a 51.02 per cent increase in net claims, adding that the sharp increase in the net claims was due to increased claims from the oil and gas business line. Baiye said that the company’s gross claims expenses rose from N738.32m in 2019 to N1.29bn as of the end of 2020. The chairman disclosed that the company’s profit after tax in 2020 was N628.59m, compared to N649.59m in 2019. While giving account of the group’s performance, he said that the total asset base of the group as of the end of 2020 stood at N12.75bn, while the equity attributable to the company in the group at the same time was N6.47bn. The chairman reassured its shareholders that the company’s fundamentals remained strong and that it was well positioned to meet the new minimum capital requirements of the National Insurance Commission. He recalled that NAICOM had earlier extended the deadline for compliance with insurance industry’s recapitalisation due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. While noting that projections were that the economy would continue to grow in 2021, he said the company was prepared to take full advantage of the upsurge in economic activities. Copyright PUNCH.
