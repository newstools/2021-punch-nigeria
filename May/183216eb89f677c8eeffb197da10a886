Fears still radiated among residents of Jibia community on Monday following the early morning bandits’ abduction of some Muslim worshippers in the town. The Katsina Police Command which rescued 30 of the abductees, however, said 10 people were still unaccounted for. The spokesman for the Command, SP Gambo Isah, provided a further explanation of the incident. He said, “Yesterday(Monday) at about 12.30am, gunmen armed with sophisticated weapons attacked a mosque which is a new building located at Abatuwa community. “The new mosque is located on the road leading to the Jibia dam, where there is little people activity, which gave the gunmen the opportunity to carry out the attack. “The gunmen abducted 40 people, but when we heard about the incident, we didn’t waste time to pursue them and we were able to rescue 30 of them. “Ten others are still missing, and we don’t know their whereabouts. An investigation is ongoing,” he added.
