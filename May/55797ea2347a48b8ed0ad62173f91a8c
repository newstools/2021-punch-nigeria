Residents of Orlu, Imo State, are currently frightened by the heavy presence of fierce looking military men at checkpoints. Our correspondent learnt that the military men shot indiscriminately for several hours at Umuna and the Timber Market junction along the Orlu/Owerri rRoad. According to a source from the community, the shootings caused panic among the people, who have since retired into their various homes for fear of being harmed or killed. “They have been shooting like this since morning; if they stop, they will continue later. We don’t know why they are shooting, but we are afraid; we don’t want to be victims of their continued shooting,” the source stated. Meanwhile, the State Chairman of the Traditional Rulers’ Institution (community policing), Eze Emmanuel Okeke, confirmed the shooting, but described it as a military routine to scare bandits and kidnappers, who had become an issue in the state. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, did not answer several calls put across to him. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
