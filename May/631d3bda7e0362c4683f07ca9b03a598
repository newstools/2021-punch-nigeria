The new Commissioner of Police in Imo State, Abutu Yaro, on Thursday, assumed office and said he would put an end to the killing of policemen and burning of security formations in the state. Yaro spoke at the command headquarters shortly after taking over from Nasiru Muhammed. He said although the attacks on the police had affected the psyche and moral of the cops, there were strategic plans to halt and win the war against the attackers. The CP said, “The challenge at the moment is enormous but with the cooperation of all of us, we will achieve positive results. “Within the period the Imo State Police Command will be under my watch, we will do our best to revive visibility policing and ensure that police assets and personnel are seen in the public domain, because visibility policing has the potential of reducing criminality.” Copyright PUNCH.
