The Federal Government on Wednesday said the distribution of the four million free electricity prepaid meters pledged by the Central Bank of Nigeria would soon begin across the country. The Minister of Power, Mamman Saleh, said this while answering questions from State House correspondents after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The CBN had promised to augment the government’s effort to distribute free prepaid meters with additional four million pieces. Saleh assured Nigerians that the government was wrapping up the distribution of its initial one million meters, which he labelled phase zero, and would soon begin the distribution of the four million others, which he dubbed phase one. He said, “It’s ongoing; we are almost rounding off. We have almost finished with phase zero. We are now going into phase one of the distribution of the metres; that is the remaining four million the Central Bank promised to augment with. “The first set is one million; we’re about to finish with that, but you know, it’s not the target, one million is very negligible compared to the demand of Nigerians.” The minister added that Nigeria now generates 5,000 MW as opposed to the initial 3,000MW. He further disclosed that the Federal Executive Council approved $8.29m as well as N3bn for the execution of six major electricity projects in the country. Saleh said the projects, which include the procurement of equipment as well as designs and manufactures, were meant to upgrade Nigeria’s electricity facilities and improve power supply across the country. He added that the Ministry of Power tabled six memoranda to the FEC, with all six approved. He said, “The Federal Executive Council today approved six memos under the Ministry of Power. The first one is the award of a contract for design, manufacturing and supply of critical spare parts for Crompton Greaves 330 kV, 132 kV and 33 kV circuit breakers to Messrs.
