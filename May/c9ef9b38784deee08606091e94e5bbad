California on Wednesday issued a warning against printing or buying fake Covid-19 vaccination cards on the internet, saying they were illegal and could undermine public health during the pandemic. Fake cards were being sold “for individuals to misrepresent themselves as vaccinated,” the state’s Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. “These counterfeit records undermine the health and safety of Californians and are also illegal.” Bonta called for people to report alleged fake cards, and added that Californians should also not post pictures of cards on social media as personal information could be stolen to commit fraud. All Californians have free access to the coronavirus vaccine, and receive a vaccination card at their first injection. US media have reported that people opposing vaccinations have posted tutorials on websites and chat forums showing how to produce fake cards. A bar owner in Clements, a small town in California, was arrested in May for allegedly making and selling fake cards for $20 each. Vaccination cards will soon be required for some public events in California, such as the famous Hollywood Bowl stadium in Los Angeles. It will reopen for its traditional summer concerts, reserving 85 percent of seats for vaccinated spectators. The remainder will have to bring a negative test carried out less than 72 hours before the show. A vaccination card could also soon enable Americans to travel to the European Union, which said Wednesday it would open its borders to vaccinated travellers. AFP
