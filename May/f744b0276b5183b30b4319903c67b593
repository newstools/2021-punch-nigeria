Nigeria’s first secondary school, the CMS Grammar School, Lagos, will be celebrating its 162nd  anniversary on June 6, 2021. The theme of the celebration is ‘Pluming Wings for Higher Flight’. A statement by the Old Grammarian Society president, Mr Olu Vincent, said the school which was established on June 6, 1859 had never failed to mark its Founders’ Day, except for 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic affected the celebration. “Next week, there will be a career talk and students’ feast. A prize-giving celebration will be held for students who have attained academic excellence, as well as success in some special categories.” “The proprietors of the school must be acknowledged for their efforts and determination to ensure academic excellence and sound moral standards among the students,” Vincent said. Highlighting some of the recent achievements in his administration, Vincent said the school had Nigeria’s very first state-of-the-art e-library, an olympic-sized swimming pool, fully furnished hostel facilities, an air-conditioned hall, a modern basketball court with spectator stand. “We also have a modern sickbay facility with matrons’ quarters, a bakery under construction, a multi-million naira digitalisation programme, solar panels for independent power generation, and a football field which was being upgraded to a modern stadium with indoor sporting facilities,” he said.
