Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has confirmed that Anthony Joshua will be fighting Tyson Fury on August 14th in Saudi Arabia. Hearn is looking to finalize the date for the Joshua-Fury clash in a built-arena in Saudi. Hearn is finalizing the paperwork and hopes to have the fight ready to be announced soon. It’s a lot of work to go through all the forms to get the fight made, but he’s confident that’ll get done. Hearn says these are the same people he worked with for Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz Jr’s rematch in Saudi in 2019. With the Joshua – Fury fight taking place on August 14th, an indoor arena is being built for the match. The weather would likely be too hot to stage the match outside in the sweltering summer heat in Saudi. “Yeah,” said Hearn to iFL TV when asked if it’s true that the date and location for the Joshua vs. Fury fight are on August 14th in Saudi. “I agree with Frank (Warren) for once, that is correct. “The 7th was actually the original date that the fight was planned for, but that’s also the final day of the Olympics, so the 14th is. “We’re finalising bits of escrow agreements and basic stuff, but yeah, he’s right. August 14th in Saudi Arabia. These are the same people we dealt with before (for the Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz Jr rematch in Saudi in December 2019). “We have to go through that process, which is a long process in terms of paperwork and escrow accounts. But everything is agreed to for the fight, and we now have to start planning for an official announcement and press conferences, and finally give everybody the fight they want so badly. I told everyone all along, “‘The fight is happening,’ and it is happening. Now, thankfully, the other side (Team Fury) agrees,” said Hearn. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
