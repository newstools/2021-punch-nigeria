This move was spearheaded by Elon Musk, and hosted by Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor. Musk tweeted, “Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.” Saylor tweeted, “Yesterday I was pleased to host a meeting between Elon Musk and the leading bitcoin miners in North America.

In a related development, ethereum is closing in on a long-sought fix to cut energy us by over 99 per cent Bloomberg reports. The second most valuable cryptocurrency is making strides in reducing its carbon footprint. ETH and Bitcoin utilise a proof-of-work system that requires a global network of computers that never stop working. Software developers at ETH have been working for years to transition the blockchain to what is known as a proof-of-stake system Bloomberg said. This system uses an entire new approach to secure the network and also eliminates carbon emission problems. Inventor of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin said, “Switching to proof of stake has become more urgent for us because of how crypto and Ethereum have grown over the last year. “I’m definitely very happy that one of the biggest problems of blockchain will go away when proof of stake is complete.” The inventor is hoping for the changes by 2021’s year. The change could boost the price of ETH to compete with Bitcoin, as the digital currency becomes more environmentally friendly. As cryptocurrencies provide an alternative to traditional finances, central banks around the world (save Africa) have begun to set plans for their digital currencies in place.
