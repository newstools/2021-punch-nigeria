A veteran actor, Akin Lewis, has encouraged filmmakers in the country to make movies that address contemporary societal ills. Lewis who spoke at the private screening of a social impact movie, The New Patriots, noted that such films sensitised people to happenings around them. He said, “There is the need for Nollywood to produce movies that address contemporaneous societal ills, and not only make movies that aim to simply entertain. Also, actors should give priority to playing roles that educate the populace about impactful issues in society.” The movie stars veterans, Lewis and Dele Odule, alongside talented actors such as Lateef Adedimeji, Bimbo Oshin and Taiwo Ibikunle. Directed by Adebayo Tijani and Terry Ayebo, the movie has already gained international recognition with one of its leading actresses, Damipe Adekoya, winning the award for Best Lead Actress in a Feature Film at the Five Continents International Film Festival for her role. Billed to start showing in cinemas in July, the executive producer of the movie, Dr Rotimi Adelola, noted that it would also be available on streaming platforms. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
