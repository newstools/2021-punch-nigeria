Super Eagles striker Paul Onuachu is excited to have been awarded Belgium’s Professional Footballer of The Year  and top scorer awards for the 2020/21 season, The PUNCH reports. The 27-year-old made history by becoming the first-ever Nigerian to win the award, after he bagged 35 goals with five assists in 38 games across all competitions. He also won the Belgium Cup and helped Genk qualify for the UEFA Champions League after they finished as runners-up to Club Brugge in the league. “It has been a remarkable season for me and I’m pleased with the way it ended,” Onuachu told The PUNCH. “No doubt it’s one of my best seasons. The award means a lot to me because the Belgian league is difficult, unlike the way people see it to be. This award could not have been possible without my coach and my teammates.” Onuachu, who also finished the season as the highest-scoring African in Europe’s top 10 leagues, hopes to claim the Ebony Shoe award next month. The Ebony Shoe is awarded to the best African player or player of African descent in the Belgian topflight. This season’s winner will be announced on June 7. “I hope to win the Ebony Shoe as well, it has always been the dream, but let’s see how it goes.” The Nigerian could also become the first Nigerian to win the Ebony Shoe since Celestine Babayaro did in 1996 while at Anderlecht. The other names on the shortlist are Onuachu’s teammate Theo Bongonda, Anderlecht duo Albert Sambi Lokonga and Lukas Nmecha, as well as Clinton Mata (Club Brugge). Copyright PUNCH.
