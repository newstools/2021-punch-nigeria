The Chairman of Oyo State Chapter of the Oodua People’s Congress, Rotimi Olumo, has called on the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, and other traditional rulers in the South-West to intervene in the case of the detained three members of the group. Olumo said this in Ibadan on Thursday while speaking with journalists. He said the members assisted the police to arrest Fulani warlord, Iskilu Wakili, who they were unable to arrest, adding that instead of praising them, the police arrested and hurled into police custody. The three members of the OPC were part of the vigilantes that apprehended Wakili in the Ibarapa are of Oyo State. Ibarapa people had accused Wakili and his gang of being notorious for kidnapping, destruction of farms and armed robbery, among others. However, the police detained three of the youths who were among those that took Wakili to the police station. They were charged with murder and arson and the court ordered that they be remanded in custody. Olumo said, “We are calling on all traditional rulers in the south-West Region to intervene  in the release of our three members still in prison. “It’s not a crime for members of the OPC to secure Yorubaland and we have been doing that for long. “We want the Oyo State Government to know that the OPC is complementing the effort of the state government in making sure that kidnappers and other criminals do not take over the state. “We are appealing to Alafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi; Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi; the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Adetunji Saliu; the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, and all other traditional rulers in the South-West to intervene.” Copyright PUNCH.
