The Federal Government in partnership with the United States Centre for Disease Control has launched the second phase of a survey aimed at estimating the percentage of people who have immunity against COVID-19 in the Federal Capital Territory and Kano State. The survey, which is funded by the USCDC, is to be executed by the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Nigerian Office. This was disclosed in a statement on Monday by the Director of Communications and Public Relations Specialist, University of Maryland, Nigerian Office, Sunday James, titled ‘COVID-19 seroprevalence survey.’ James said the survey was due to commence in the first week of June in 38 enumeration areas across the FCT and Kano State. According to the statement, the survey will enable targeted participants to know their malaria and COVID-19 status as well as receive important information about how to prevent COVID-19 in their household with an added opportunity to interact with a trained health professional for any coronavirus-related issues. The statement added, “More so, those who are diagnosed with malaria will be treated instantly while COVID-19 cases will be referred and followed up for adequate free management and care. “The government of Nigeria through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is providing technical assistance and some structural synergy for smooth implementation of all planned activities for the survey.” The Director Special duties, Health and Human Services, Federal Capital Territory Administration, Dr Matthew Ashikini, was also quoted in the statement as saying that those who are to participate have been properly trained and equipped with skills for the data collection.
