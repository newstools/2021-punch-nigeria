Azman Air Services Limited, on Wednesday, said it had received an aircraft with registration number 5N-HBY after a routine maintenance check in Turkey. The airline said the aircraft landed safely at the international wing of Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. “@AzmanAir 5N-HBY landed safely today at the International Wing of MMA Lagos after a routine maintenance check in Turkey,” the company said on Twitter. The airline also noted that the additional aircraft would boost its operations in terms of reliability and expansion. The PUNCH reported in March that the airline was suspended by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority in accordance with the Civil Aviation Act, 2006. The NCAA noted that the operations of all the Boeing 73 Aircraft in the fleet of Azman Air Services were suspended from operations. The NCAA, however, lifted the suspension after a meeting with the airline. The airline confirmed that the suspension was lifted after a meeting with the NCAA on May 1, 2020. Copyright PUNCH.
