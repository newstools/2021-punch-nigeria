The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Benue State, Mr. Terver Akase, has said no land in the state will be surrendered for the establishment of cattle colonies no matter the attacks by herdsmen. He said this in a tweet following the report that several people were feared killed by bandits who attacked some villages in the Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of the state. Sources alleged that the act was perpetrated by Fulani men. However, The PUNCH could not immediately confirm the veracity of the allegation. One of the sources claimed that about 36 people were murdered early hours of Thursday in Shitile, Shikaan, Mbagena Kpav. Another source said over 10 people died. The news of the incident sparked reactions on Twitter with many Nigerians expressing their displeasure using the hashtag #BenueUnderAttack. Activist Aisha Yesufu who joined the hashtag, said, “The lives of Benue people must be protected. No Nigerian is more Nigerian than any Nigerian.” @aproko_doctor tweeted, “We can’t fold our hands and watch anymore. #BenueUnderAttack. People are being killed in their homes and lands and the government is watching. This is a ticking time bomb. Protect all Nigerian citizens!” @BenueElites tweeted, “For how long will we keep on suffering? They drive us out of our homes, take our lands.
We seek refuge in our IDP camps, they go ahead to attack us there. Enough is enough! We demand all stakeholders at all levels to do the needful!” While appreciating all those who showed concern regarding the situation in Benue, Akase revealed that his principal, Governor Samuel Ortom, has ensured the deployment of troops to the affected area. “We deeply appreciate everyone for the solidarity with Benue State via the hashtag #BenueUnderAttack. No matter the attacks by herdsmen, Benue won’t surrender its lands for cattle colonies. Gov Ortom has already ensured the deployment of troops to Katsina-Ala,” he tweeted.
