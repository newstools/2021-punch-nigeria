Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has assured Nigerians that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) is doing everything possible to restore peace and security in the country. The minister made this known while receiving the management of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations on a courtesy visit to his office in Abuja on Monday. His statement was made available to the public by his Special Assistant on Media, Segun Adeyemi. While addressing the NIPR executives, Mohammed stressed that the administration was working to curb insecurity in the country because security will fuel development. “Without security, there can be no development and that’s why this administration is doing everything possible to return peace and security across the country,” he was quoted as saying. He then called on the NIPR to also play their part in ensuring that the country was peaceful and secured. He said, “Each of us in our respective positions has a role to play to tone down the rhetoric and reduce the tension (in the polity), and I am glad that NIPR is lending its platform to work with the government to ensure that we have a country, which is peaceful and which is secured.”
