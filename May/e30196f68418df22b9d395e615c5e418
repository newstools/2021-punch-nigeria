The Presidency has disclosed that there was an attempt by armed robbers to burgle the residence of the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari, early Monday morning. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, revealed this in a two-part tweet on Monday night. He tweeted, “The Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari has confirmed that there ‘was a foolish attempt’ to burgle his residence at 3:00am this morning but it turned out to be unsuccessful. “Professor Gambari, whose house is on a street next to the Villa has assured that there is nothing to worry about from the incident.” A news platform, Peoples Gazette, had reported that armed robbers invaded Aso Rock and emptied Gambari’s residence as well as the residence of an Administration Officer in the Presidency, Abubakar Maikano. “The robbers took away as much as possible from both places,” a security officer that confirmed the incident said. “What is more unfortunate is that no one has been arrested,” the news platform had reported. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has recently come under fire over the escalating insecurity in the country, with many losing confidence in the ability of Buhari, a retired military commander, who won the 2015 and 2019 general elections with the promise of ending the kidnappings, killings, banditry, and other crimes in the country.
