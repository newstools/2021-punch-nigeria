The Peoples Democratic Party has expelled one of its members in Edo State, Kassim Afegbua, over alleged anti-party activities. Afegbua was an aide to a former governor of Edo State and ex-National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. Afegbua had also accused PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, of fraud and had asked the Economic and Financial Commission to probe the party’s finances. But the PDP announced his expulsion in a letter signed by the party’s chairman in Edo State, Tony Aziegbemi. The letter was addressed to Secondus. It was titled, ‘Re: Resolution Of The Expulsion Of Kassim Afegbua As A Member Of PDP’. The statement read, “Mr Kassim Afegbua as a member engaged in series of anti-party activities in his ward before and during Edo State Gubernatorial Election of September 19, 2020. “All attempts by his ward, local government area and state disciplinary committees to secure his attendance at various meetings to clear himself of all allegations proved abortive. “I hereby forward herewith to you the expulsion of Mr Kassim Afegbua as unanimously affired by the state disciplinary committee of our party in Edo State.” But reacting in a statement titled, ‘On My Purported Expulsion’, Afegbua described the party’s decision as “ridiculous, laughable and draconian,” saying he would engage his lawyers. “First and foremost, it is a blatant lie that I was ever invited to any disciplinary committee. The state chairman is just acting the script of one Uche Secondus who is desperately making effort to carry out a misplaced political vendetta because of my petition to the EFCC to seek accountability and transparency. “If this ridiculous, laughable and purported expulsion is meant to dissuade me from pursuing my call for transparency, accountability and probity in the management of the party’s resources, let it be known that I will pursue my call to a logical conclusion,” he vowed.
