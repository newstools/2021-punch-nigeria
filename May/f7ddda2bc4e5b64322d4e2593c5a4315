The Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Housing, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, has advised workers of the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority to maintain positive dispositions when dealing with real estate practitioners and the general public. Benson-Awoyinka, in a statement on Sunday, stressed the need for workers of the agency to embrace ethics and professionalism. She was quoted to have made the statement during a five-day agency’s in-house staff learning and development programme on Customer Service Professional Ethics and Practice. “As a team member of LASRERA, practitioners in the sector, as well as the general public are bound to ask us many questions, lodge complaints and make different requests from us;  hence the need for us to be prepared to provide clear answers to all the enquiries. This is one of the benefits of this in-house training.” “As representatives of this agency, we must give adequate information needed to instil public confidence in our activities,” Benson-Awoyinka said. One of the facilitators during the training session, Mr Nduka Mba-Uzoukwu, who spoke on ‘Customer Service Excellence,’ opined that sustaining the state government’s goals in service delivery would ensure a great experience for the stakeholders in the state’s real estate market.
