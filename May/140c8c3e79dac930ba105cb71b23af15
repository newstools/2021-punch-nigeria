In the midst of the Covid-19 upsurge in India, two lions at a safari park have been tested positive for the virus. India has experienced an upsurge in the coronavirus pandemic. Last Wednesday, the country recorded up to 3,780 Covid-19 deaths, being the highest single-day death toll. Hospitals in India are also struggling to meet up with the excessive increase of Covid-19 patients. So far, animals have also been affected by the virus as two lions at the safari park tested positive for the virus. According to officials at Etawah Safari Park in the Indian State Uttar Pradesh, both the lions were discovered to have high temperature and their samples were sent for testing, CNN reported. According to authorities, both infected lions were in stable condition. Both lions “have been kept in self-isolation with their health being monitored regularly,” stated the report. However, this is not the first time that lions have been tested positive for the virus. Earlier this week, eight lions at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad, India had tested positive for the virus. In a previous statement, the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change had pointed out that experience showed that zoo animals have been tested for Covid-19 across the world. It further noted that there is  “no factual evidence that animals can transmit the disease to humans any further.”
