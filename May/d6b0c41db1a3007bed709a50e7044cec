The workers of Imo state College of Education, Ihitte Uboma, have demanded for the sack of the acting Provost of the institution, Dr. Bonn Asiegbu. The staff on Monday, stated in a release that the acting Provost lacked requisite qualifications to head an academic institution adding that he had not been a lecturer all his life, hence lacked experience as a chief lecturer in a tertiary institution. The staff also said that he (Asiegbu) mandated them to obtain Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, when he did not qualify to apply for it, adding that Asiegbu had passed the appointment age of 55. Moreso, the release stated that contrary to the National Commission for Colleges of Education guidelines for appointment of a Provost PP13, Section 2.8 subsection 2.8.1 ,Asiegbu did not have five years cognate experience. The release partly read, “Dr. Bonn Asiegbu does not have any of the above listed criteria such as TC II, NCE or B.Ed or even PDE let alone PGDE as required qualification to be a Provost of the college, one therefore wonders how he managed to wangle his way to the position”. “The state government may further consult similar constitution, like Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, Nwafor Oruzu College of Education or even the National Commission for Colleges of Education to verify these facts”. Meanwhile, the staff also said that as at the time of the undue appointment, records showed that Asiegbu had passed the age specified in the Revised Condition of service for College of Education Guidelines which they said stated 55 years. He added that  Asiegbu was 63 as at the time of the appointment. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
