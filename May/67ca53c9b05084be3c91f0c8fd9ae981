Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has warned residents, especially non-indigenes, living in the state against the shielding of criminals. The governor said suspicious movement must be reported to appropriate quarters in the interest of continued peaceful coexistence in the state. Oyetola spoke at the Governor’s Meeting held at Adenle Grammar School Ayetoro, Osogbo, with representatives of non-indigenous communities resident in Osogbo Federal Constituency. Addressing the participants at the meeting which include representatives of Hausa, Igbo, Tivs, Ebira, Igede, Igala, and Fulani, Oyetola, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, commended the non-indigenes in the state for their commitment to peace and stability, despite series of security challenges linked to non-indigenes in other places. He said, “We reassure you of our resolve to further engender inclusive governance, peaceful coexistence as well as the security of all and sundry in the state. Don’t harbour criminals. Always report cases of breakdown of law to the appropriate authority on time. “We also charge all residents to abide by the laws and orders, as the government would not condone any erring individual or group irrespective of social, religious and ethnic consideration.” In his remarks, the Senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Ajibola Basiru, explained the importance of continuous engagement with various stakeholders, describing it as a good means of managing series of ethnic challenges to sustain peaceful coexistence. Representatives of different ethnic groups in their remarks pledged their commitment to better security in the state and assured to monitor activities among non-indigenes with a view to reporting suspicious movement to the security agents.
