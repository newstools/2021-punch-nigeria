Barely two months after an abandoned day-old newborn was rescued near a bush in the Oko-Oba area of Lagos, another baby abandoned around Orile bus stop has been found by the police. The baby girl said to be about one-month-old was rescued around 8am on Friday by policemen attached to the Orile division and handed over to the Gender Unit of the state police command in Ikeja. The spokesperson for the police, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, in a statement on Friday said some passersby who sighted the baby alerted the police. Adejobi stated that the officer in charge of the gender unit took the baby to the office of the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who directed that she should be given proper medical attention and taken to a government accredited shelter for custody and proper care. He added, “The CP reassured the general public that the command will continue to work with all relevant government agencies and interest groups in fighting against this inhuman act and other social vices in Lagos State.” Policemen from Abattoir Division had rescued a day-old baby around 10.30pm on Monday, March 15, on Oladejo Street, Oko Oba after a resident attracted to the baby’s cries raised the alarm.
