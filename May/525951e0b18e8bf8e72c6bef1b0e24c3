The Comptroller of the Apapa Command of the Nigeria Customs Service, Mallanta Yusuf, has said the command generated N65.46bn in  April. He said the revenue collected by the command in April rose by N25.59bn when compared to the collection of the same month in 2020. “This unprecedented record has never been achieved in the history of Apapa Area Command,” he said at a press briefing on Thursday. He said the command had also impounded some harmful and unauthorised products that were imported into the country. Yusuf said, “In line with the provision of extant laws, trade guidelines and enforcement of government fiscal policy measures, the command was able to further strengthen its anti-smuggling operations against economic saboteurs through credible intelligence-driven operations. “This led to the seizure of 4x40ft containers laden with unregistered pharmaceuticals (674 cartons of tramadol tablets in 225mg and 120mg, and 805 cartons of codeine syrup in 100ml) at APMT and Sifax 3 bonded terminal respectively. These importations contravene sections 46 & 47 of Customs and Excise Management act CAP C 45 LFN 2004.” According to him, the drugs pose a serious threat to the health of the citizenry and the economic well-being of the country. He said other items seized were two containers of unprocessed wood, and a container of scrap copper wire, adding that their exportation was in breach of Schedule 6 (items 4 and 6) of the Common External Tariff. Yusuf added that the duty paid value of the seized items stood at N1.76bn. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
