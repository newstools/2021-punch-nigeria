Yola, Maiduguri, and Jalingo would be the first cities to witness the appearance of the lunar crescent, while Birnin Kebbi would be the last, it said. Islam follows the lunar calendar which has 354 days. Like every other month, the month of Ramadan begins with the sighting of the lunar crescent. The sighting of another lunar crescent on Wednesday will signify the end of the month of Ramadan, ushering in Eid al-Fitr, and the beginning of the month of Shawwal. According to the official Twitter account of the National Moonsighting Committee, Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Tuesday is the 29th day of Ramadan 1442H, and is the first day for the Muslim faithful to look out for the Shawwal crescent. The Shawwal crescent signifies the end of Ramadan. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
