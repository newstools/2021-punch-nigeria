Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper Maduka Okoye has been nominated for the Eredivisie’s goalkeeper of the season award, The PUNCH reports. Okoye, who conceded twice as Sparta Rotterdam lost 2-0 to Feyenoord in the first leg of their semi-finals clash in the Eredivisie’s Europa Conference League playoffs on Wednesday, was nominated alongside Remko Pasveer (Vitesse), Maarten Stekelenburg (Ajax), Sergio Padt (Groningen), Nick Marsman (Feyenoord), Marco Bizot (Alkmaar) and Joel Drommel (Twente). Okoye, who was second choice to Benjamin van Leer at the start of the season, has kept 10 clean sheets in 27 games, helping Henk Fraser’s side to an eighth place finish on the league table. The 21-year-old has been linked with a move away from Sparta this summer, following his impressive debut season in the Eredivisie. The Nigeria international has been called up for next month’s international friendlies against Cameroon and Mexico. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
