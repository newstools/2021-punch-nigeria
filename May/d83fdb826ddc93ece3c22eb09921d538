the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate on Wednesday said it has commenced the payment of the consequential adjustment to pensioners under the Defined Benefit Scheme. The Executive Secretary, PTAD, Chioma Ejikeme, said this was in fulfillment of the promise made by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Buhari recently approved the implementation of the consequential adjustment to pension benefits following the new minimum wage increase of 2019. Ejikeme had also promised that the upward adjustment of pensioner’s benefit would take effect from May 2021. The directorate in a statement issued by its management in Abuja on Wednesday stated that consequently, pensioners in the four operational had begun to receive their accrued arrears. It outlined the departments of the directorate to include Civil Service Pension Department, Parastatals Pension Department, Police Pension Department, and Customs, Immigration and Prisons Pension Department. While reacting to the messages of gratitude received from some pensioners, the executive secretary assured them of PTAD’s commitment to the welfare of pensioners in the DBS. Copyright PUNCH.
