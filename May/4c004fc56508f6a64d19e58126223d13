MEMBERS of the Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, on Thursday, held two parallel stakeholders’ meetings to assess the performance of the Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq-led administration and the state of the party after two years. At the stakeholders meeting, which Abdulrazaq and other government functionaries attended, the state party leaders and stakeholders gave the administration a pass mark. Those, who attended the event at the Government House, testified that Kwara State had “never had it so good.” Speaker of the House of Assembly, Yakubu Danladi-Salihu, the Head of Service, Mrs Susan Oluwole and a representative of people living with disabilities, Bashiru Yusuf, were among those who spoke. The Speaker said, “We at the Kwara State House of Assembly, are satisfied that Governor Abdulrazaq has done wonderfully well in the last two years. Whoever is saying no to Governor Abdulrazaq, is saying no to the progress and development of the state.” Also speaking, Abdulrazaq said, “We have our records; at the right time we shall expose them. They were getting the same money that we are getting but they squandered everything. We shall continue to do the right thing for our people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
