The National Business and Technical Examination Board has released the results for the 2020 Ordinary and Advanced level with 25,844 candidates scoring five credits and above with or without English Language and mathematics out of the 32,541 that sat for the exam. At the announcement in Benin, Registrar/Chief Executive Officer of NABTEB, Prof. Ifeoma Isiugo-Abanihe, also said that 21,175 candidates obtained five credits above including English Language and mathematics. She also said that 250 candidates who sat for the examination were found to be involved in malpractices, noting that the examination body will continue to make more effort by stepping up examination personnel and use of technology to further check examination fraud. She said, “The business of conducting national examinations is a challenging one. This performance is quite rewarding to candidates and statistically similar to those of 2019 November/December. The board has continued to strengthen it quality assurance mechanisms. “It is gratifying that despite the ravaging effect of Covid-19 pandemic which necessitated the postponement of both the 2020 May/June and November/December certificate examinations, NABTEB was able to successfully conduct the two exams from January 25 to Friday 19, 2021. “I will like to use this opportunity to remind everyone of the dire need for increased emphasis on Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) at all levels in the country. The principal objective of TVET is to train youths and adults, preparing them to develop relevant skills needed for today’s labour market and for academic progression.”
