The National Directorate of Employment has enrolled 40 unemployed school leavers in the Environmental Beautification Training Scheme in Ogun State. The Acting Director General of NDE, Mallam Nuhu Fikpo, represented by the Ogun State Coordinator of the NDE, Bakare Tajudeen, made this known at the inauguration of the EBTS in the state capital, Abeokuta. Tajudeen highlighted that the NDE training programmes were designed for youths towards the implementation of strategic policy action in improving employability, closing skill gaps, building a competent workforce of technicians and artisans and providing incentives for private landscaping service providers to create opportunities for training new entrants into the labour market. He said that the EBTS would contribute to job creation, noting that it would also provide starter packs at the end of the training to enable participants set up their businesses. The coordinator disclosed that the training would be implemented in two phases to provide hard and soft landscaping skills to enhance their competence. The participants were drawn from across the 20 local governments in the state with two selected from each LG. The coordinator stated that the participants and trainers would be paid stipends for the three-month duration of the programme. Tajudeen added that the training would involve tilling, making and installation of POP, interlocking, kebs production and installation, and horticulture. The NDE topnotch, who lauded the initiative geared towards curbing societal ills created by unemployment, enjoined participants to be humble and punctual during the course of the training.
