Various items and facilities worth about N160m were lost in the April 21, 2021 fire, which gutted the upper chamber of the Katsina State of House of Assembly. The Chairman of the committee set up by the House to investigate the incident, Abubakar Korau, made the revelation while presenting the report to the Speaker, Tasiu Maigari, on Thursday. The report also stated that the incident was caused by an electrical fault in the inner part of the chamber. Korau added that workers of the state fire service department engaged by members of the committee said the electrical fault did not happen overnight, stressing that lack of adequate check by the Assembly workers as well the non-availability of fire alarm gadgets led to the fire incident. Receiving the report, Speaker of the Assembly, Tasiu Maigari, commended members of the committee for a thorough job. Sources at the Assembly revealed that the report would be submitted to Governor Aminu Masari on Monday. An early morning inferno burnt down the upper chamber of the Assembly on April 21, 2021. Items either completely burnt included the Speakerâ€™s seat as well as those of other lawmakers being used during plenary sessions. The public gallery and the media section as well as glass planes used to partition parts of the chamber and the POP used to decorate the ceiling, were also not spared. There was, however, no loss of life. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
