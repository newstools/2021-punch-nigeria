The management of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State says it will investigate the reason behind the death of one its students identified as Feranmi Fasunle. Fasunle reportedly died as a result of the sniper she allegedly drank on Wednesday night. It was gathered that the 200-level student of the Department of Political Science at the varsity drank the insecticide on Wednesday night in her room and was later rushed to the school’s health centre but was later referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Owo where she gave up the ghost early Thursday. The reason for taking the action against herself was yet unknown. It was insinuated in some quarters that the deceased had relationship issue but some of her friends refuted this as they said she had no boyfriend. The Head of Media and Protocols of institution, Victor Akinpelumi, speaking on the incident, described the student’s death as unfortunate, saying there was indication that Fasunle committed suicide for another reason and not on relationship matter. Akinpelumi said, “It is true that she committed suicide. We have not been officially briefed but the only details we have is that she took sniper and she was later rushed to the state health centre and from there she was referred to the Federal Medical Centre in Owo. “The bad incident happened on Wednesday and we have not carried out our findings to ascertain if she committed suicide over relationship issues but from what we gathered she had no boyfriend. “The doctor, who spoke with me, said those who brought her said they were close to her and that she was not involved in any relationship. So, why she did that to herself is what we are yet to know. “We will further react if we later know why she took that decision to take her own life.”
