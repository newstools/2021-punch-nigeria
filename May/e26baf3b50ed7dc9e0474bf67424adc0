THE National Secretary of the Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, has said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), and other stakeholders will determine the date for the convention. He said this while addressing newsmen after an emergency meeting of the committee, at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, on Monday. Akpanudoedehe said, “ The convention can be done in June and congresses can start and end in June, but it all depends on what the leaders of this party agreed upon. “This committee is honest and we have never lied to Nigerians. We can always fight and resolve at family level. “I can tell you that we are looking into so many things. And I can tell you that we have to consult extensively before we will do anything. We have major stakeholders like Mr. President, Vice President, Governors among others.” Akpanudoedehe further said, “We have lots of problems in the country, not only the national Congress of the party. We have serious security issues like the agitations going on in the zones. “We are very conscious of Nigeria as a country, not only the congresses. We are mindful that our party must be strong. We just welcomed the governor of Cross River State and assuming we were having congress, how would we have accommodated him. “Be rest assured that the overall interest is paramount to us. We have taken lots of things into consideration to ensure that the party is peaceful and united. On the recent membership registration and revalidation exercise, the party Secretary explained that over 21 states have already submitted their final reports while others are putting finishing touches to theirs.
