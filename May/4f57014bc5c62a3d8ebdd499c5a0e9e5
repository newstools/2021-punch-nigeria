The people of Kwapree community in the Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State have cried out for help one month after the abduction of 52 residents by Boko Haram members, who have demanded N28m ransom for the victims. The PUNCH had reported that on April 9, the insurgents, who wore military uniforms, attacked the community, killing 10 persons and displacing over 5,000 residents. The village head of Kwapre, Joel Kulaha, who spoke to our correspondent on Wednesday, lamented that the Boko Haram insurgents had been asking his community to pay N28m ransom for the victims. The traditional ruler noted with concern how the hoodlums destroyed the community and at the same time demanded such a huge amount of money from them. Kulaha appealed to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), the state Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, and other well-to-do individuals to come to their aid so that his subjects would regain their freedom. The ward heads of Kwapre I and II, Sabon Gari, Kwapre Central, Hayin Rafi and Unguwan Masalaci â€“ Usman Yarda, Abenego Bitrus, Naptali Gabriel, Saidu Dauda, Silas Apolos and Jonah Gayus, respectively, appealed to the state governor to assist in securing the release of the victims. Earlier, a delegation representing the Adamawa State Government, led by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Aminu Iya-Abbas, condoled with the community over the attacks on residents.
