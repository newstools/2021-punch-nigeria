The Peoples Democratic Party has hailed the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, over his victory at the Supreme Court. It described the victory as that of good over evil. This was contained in a statement titled, “PDP Hails Gov. Obaseki’s Victory At Supreme Court …Says It’s Triumph of the Will of the People,” signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Friday. The party said the Supreme Court Judgment upholding the election of Obaseki, is “as the inevitable triumph of the will of the people over anti-democratic forces.“ The PDP said the verdict of the apex court in throwing out the petition of All Progressives Congress is a resounding reinforcement of the popularity of the PDP and Governor Obaseki in Edo state, as firmly established in the election. The party urged Governor Obaseki to continue in his commitment towards the development of the state and the wellbeing of his people in line with the manifesto and ideology of the PDP; the very reason he was overwhelmingly re-elected as governor of the state. Ologbondiyan further said, “The PDP is proud of Governor Obaseki for the empowerment of the people as well as massive infrastructural development of Edo state in critical areas of healthcare, education, agriculture and food production, oil and gas, industrialization among others.“ The party also commended the judiciary for its courage in upholding justice and the will of the people in the Edo governorship election. The APC is yet to react to the judgment.
