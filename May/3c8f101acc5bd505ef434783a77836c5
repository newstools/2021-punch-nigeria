Nigerian athletes have lamented the postponement of the 2021 African Athletics Championships in Algeria. Africa’s flagship athletics event, which was billed to hold in Oran between June 22 and 26, after it was moved forward from last year, was again postponed due to COVID-19 concerns. Announcing the postponement, the Algerian Ministry of Youth and Sports in a statement said the postponement was “due to the health situation, marked by resurgence in the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the risk of circulation of new variant(s).” Speaking with our correspondent on Thursday, men’s 110m hurdler, Oyeniyi Abejoye, described the postponement as disheartening. “I feel really bad about it, but I still have to keep a positive mindset. I believe it will hold before the Olympics, so we have to stay in camp pending when the date will be fixed,” Abejoye told The PUNCH. Henry Okolie, 400m hurdler, said, “It is a very painful situation, the country (Algeria) felt it was no longer safe for them to host the event. Although painful, we have to bear with them.” National discuss thrower Utitofon James bemoaned the opportunity to attend her first international event. “When I saw the news online, I felt very bad, because I was already looking forward to my first international meet. I prepared so well for it. But that notwithstanding, I will keep training because I know that there are more competitions ahead,” she told The PUNCH. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
