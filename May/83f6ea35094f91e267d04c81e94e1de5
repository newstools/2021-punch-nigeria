NO fewer than four policemen were attached to the residence of Maikano Abdullahi, the Administrative Officer of the Presidential Villa, which was targetted by suspected burglars.

The building which was located a stone’s throw from the residence of the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was situated a few metres from a military post usually manned by about four soldiers. Checks also indicate that the building located within the Presidential Villa precinct, had a watchtower where a sniper was usually stationed. The building was said to host a huge number of contractors and individuals seeking Abdullahi’s influence and presidential connections to sort out issues. Security sources said the intruders must have believed that there were huge sums of money in the building. It was gathered that the suspected burglars were chased away by an armed Mobile Police officer on duty at the time of the breach. The intruders, who reportedly came in through a back street, scaled the fence into the premises and on seeing the armed policeman in the compound jumped over the wall and made good their escape. A source said, “What happened was that the intruders scaled the fence from the backstreet and on landing inside the compound saw an armed MOPOL. So, they ran and managed to jump out of the fence and escaped.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
