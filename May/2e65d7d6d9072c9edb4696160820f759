The Ogun State Police Command has said it is investigating allegations against some naval ratings who reportedly connived with land grabbers in the state. Some men of the Nigerian Navy attached to the Arepo pipeline in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state were accused of conniving with some land grabbers to harass residents of Fowowawo village near the Magbon Etido area of the local government. A petition written by Chief Layo Shittu Opaleye, Waheed Ilo, Chief Waheed Murano and Ismaila Sanyaolu, claimed that the naval ratings allegedly flogged them and their relatives. They also alleged that the ratings obtained money from motorists and passers-by in the area. The petitioners, through their lawyer, PeachTree Solicitors, claimed that they had evidence to support their allegations. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed that the command was treating the petition. On the involvement of the navy in the matter, Oyeyemi said, “You know the Navy cannot just go there on their own, if not on invitation from somebody. So, those people that involved the Navy in that issue we first need to question them to know the reason they did it.” A spokesman for the Navy, who identified himself only as Muhammed, confirmed that his ratings worked around the area. He added that they  were drawn from the Lagos headquarters to man the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation pipeline in the community. “Let the state Commissioner of Police write to the Navy and let it be official because these officers are not on illegal duties,” he added. ”Copyright PUNCH.
