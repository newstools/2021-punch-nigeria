Shareholders of Sterling Bank Plc approved resolutions for payment of five kobo per share dividend for the 2020 financial period. A statement, titled ‘FY 2020: Shareholders commend Sterling Bank’s improved performance’ on Thursday, said the shareholders gave the approval at the 59th annual general meeting of the bank which held by proxy in Lagos and streamed live across digital platforms. The Chairman, Board of Directors, Sterling Bank, Mr Asue Ighodalo, said the bank focused on the continued strategic development of its core pillars – digitisation, agility and specialisation – in a challenging year. Ighodalo said, “Sterling Bank sustained an improvement in business performance during the year under review despite the harsh economic environment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Although earnings declined by 7.5 per cent to N138.9bn, we delivered a 15.9 per cent growth in profit before tax and a 6.0 per cent growth in profit after tax to N12.4bn and N11.2bn respectively.” He noted that in line with the commitment to drive operational efficiency across the organisation, the bank achieved a 2.5 per cent reduction in operating expenses as it continues to leverage on past investments made in technology. He said the bank closed the year with an improved balance sheet position as total assets grew steadily by 9.8 per cent to N1.3ton in 2020. This was driven by consolidated efforts in mobilising customer deposits, leading to a record 6.5 per cent growth in deposit base to reach N950.8bn from N892.7bn in 2019. Ighodalo said the bank achieved a 39.5 per cent growth in low-cost current and savings accounts deposits resulting in an improved deposit mix of 78.9 per cent (CASA/total deposit) during the year under review. He said this contributed largely to the improved cost of funds from 6.3 per cent in 2019 to 4.7 per cent in 2020 below the five per cent threshold. The bank also grew shareholders’ funds by 13.5 per cent to N135.8bn on the back of a rise in retained earnings. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
