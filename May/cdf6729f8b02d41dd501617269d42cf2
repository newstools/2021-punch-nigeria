American rapper and actor A$AP Rocky has confirmed dating rumours with singer, actress, and Fenty Beauty CEO, Robyn Rihanna Fenty. In an interview with GQ magazine released on Wednesday, the rapper when asked about his relationship with the Barbadian beauty, regarded her as “the love of my life,” and his lady.

He also featured on the track “Cockiness” from her 2011 album Talk That Talk. Dating rumours were sparked by the pair early 2020 when both were sighted on multiple outings together, after Rihanna broke up her three-year relationship with billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel, January last year. In July, the beauty industry mogul featured the rapper in a campaign for her new line of beauty products, Fenty Skin. There were also pictures and interviews from the collaboration, which gave a sneak peek into the couple’s laid back relationship. When asked what it felt like to be in a relationship, the rapper replied without hesitation:
“So much better. So much better when you got the One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones.” “I think when you know, you know. She’s the One.” He continued. While the world was on shutdown, the artist revealed that he and Rihanna went on a cross-country road trip in a tour bus last year. Speaking on his upcoming album, He disclosed that Rihanna was the inspiration behind some of his upcoming new music. “I think it’s important to have somebody that you can bounce those creative juices and ideas off. It’s just a different point of view.” He said. When asked about plans for family life A$AP Rocky replied he would love to be a dad if it was in his destiny. “I think I’d be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad. I would have a very fly child. Very.” He continued.
