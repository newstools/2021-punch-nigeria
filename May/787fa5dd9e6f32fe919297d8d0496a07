The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is partnering the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit. Executive Secretary, NEITI, Orji Ogbonnaya-Orji, said the aim of partnerships was to ensure the enforcement of compliance and sanctions in the extractive sectors. The NEITI boss, who disclosed this at the agency’s headquarters in Abuja in a meeting with reporters, stressed that compliance had been a challenge to extractive industries transparency initiative. He said, “One of the challenges we have in implementing the EITI is compliance and enforcement. You are aware that reports are published in Nigeria and is usually (a challenge) to implement. “This is because agencies just don’t think to do so. If there are no sanctions or incentives; sanctions for refusing to implement, incentives for doing well, everybody moves on and that is the bane of our society. “That is why we said that we will have to align with those who have very powerful machineries to enforce sanctions. So in the next couple of days, we will be signing a draft MoU between us and the EFCC and it is being reviewed by the two organisations. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
