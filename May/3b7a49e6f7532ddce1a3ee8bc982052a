FORMER President, Goodluck Jonathan, on Sunday backed the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, noting that the platform remains the best to discuss issues affecting the country. President Jonathan made the remarks in Benin on Sunday after attending the thanksgiving service organised to mark the 50th birthday anniversary of Pastor Charles Osazuwa, General Overseer of Rock of Ages Christian Assembly International, Benin. The former President urged the governors to eschew hostility. He said the argument between the Southern Governors’ Forum and the Northern Governors’ Forum following the former’s inaugural meeting held in Asaba last Tuesday, was uncalled for. He said, “The governors should continue to meet; I don’t love a situation where the Northern governors will meet, then the Southern governors will cry foul and vice versa. This will not help our country. “The governors through the governors’ forum should meet, they are the people who run this country, the President is just one person in Abuja.” He condemned the antagonism among the governors, saying, “I don’t really enjoy the antagonism between governors, they should come together and discuss. “If there are issues affecting one or two states, I think the governors should see how they can collectively come with a way to address those issues,” he added.
