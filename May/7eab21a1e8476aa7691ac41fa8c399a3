The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Gboyega Akosile, has said his principal was warmly received by Afrobeat musician, Seun Kuti, at the 60th birthday of the singer’s sister, Yeni Kuti. Reports (Not by The PUNCH) had stated that Seun Kuti stormed out of the event after showing Governor Sanwo-Olu the ‘middle finger.’ Reacting, Yeni Kuti tweeted, “What happened was that the security detail in the course of doing their duty pushed his wife. He got upset at them understandably, not the governor. He even explained to the governor. I beg o! He has home training.” To prove that all was well between Seun Kuti and Sanwo-Olu at the birthday party, the governor’s aide shared photos from the event on Twitter. He captioned the photos, “So it was 60th birthday of @YeniAKuti yesterday and the people’s Governor @jidesanwoolu rounded off his day by showing up and sharing a memorable moment with one of Nigeria’s talented artists. Her brothers @Femiakuti and @RealSeunKuti received the Governor warmly.”
