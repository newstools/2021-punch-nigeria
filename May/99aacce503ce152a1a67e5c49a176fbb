The Nigerian Bar Association, Ado Ekiti branch, said on Monday that the conference suggested by a legal luminary and founder of the Afe Babalola University, Aare Afe Babalola, was aimed at restoring hope to Nigerians. The branch Chairman, Adeyemi Adewumi, who criticised those tagging the event as an affront on the Federal Government’s rejection of a national conference, said Babalola meant well. The body, which spoke in a statement, said the law was clear on the right of every Nigerian either singly or together, to advise the government in good faith on how the country could move forward devoid. “The rationale behind Aare Afe Babalola’s call for a ‘Summit of Hope’ was to prevent the country from disintegrating and drifting into anarchy so that it can remain an indivisible entity. Aare Babalola’s call was to raise and restore hope for Nigerians and not in any way an attempt to remove the government from power. “We wonder how the most nationalistic suggestion to summon all living former Nigerian presidents, the leadership of the National Assembly, governors, religious leaders and frontline traditional rulers as well as civil society organisations, which was made in the most unparalleled good faith, now amounts to conspiracy to remove the government from power,” the group said.
