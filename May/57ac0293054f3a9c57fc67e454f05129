The President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has promised that his regime will assist the Republic of Chad in all ways possible, to stabilise and return to constitutional order. According to a statement on Friday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President made the promise while receiving the President, Transitional Military Council of Chad, Lt. Gen. Mahamat Itno, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The statement was titled ‘Count on us, we’ll lend a helping hand, President Buhari assured Chadian transitional leader.’ Adesina quoted the President as saying that, “We are bound together by culture and geography, and we will help in all ways we can. “Nigerians know and appreciate the role Chad played in helping us to combat terrorism, and we will continue the collaboration.” Speaking of the late Marshal Itno, Buhari was further quoted as saying that, “he was a personal friend, and a friend of Nigeria, and Chad has been very steadfast in defending Nigeria.” Buhari added that Chad should not hesitate to ask for help in areas it deemed necessary. “We will also help you to ensure a smooth transition in 18 months, as you have promised your people,” Buhari said. He assured the interim leader that Nigeria would help strengthen the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Multinational Joint Task Force. In his address, Lt. Gen. Itno appreciated Nigeria for the support displayed following the death of the former President, Idris Deby, noting that the main aim of the Transitional Military Council “is the security and cohesion of our country.” He reiterated to Buhari his commitment to run democratic, free, fair polls in 18 months, saying “You were very close to Marshal Itno. I’m here to reaffirm that relationship, and for you to support our transition. We rely on our brother country Nigeria, as we have shared history, culture and geography. We are ready to be guided by you in our journey to constitutional rule.”
