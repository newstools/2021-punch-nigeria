MODAKEKE community in Osun State on Wednesday demanded an investigation into the killing of a cocoa merchant, Titilayo Gbadegesin, and his son, Reuben, in Alapata village by some yet to be identified assailants. The community made the demand through Modakeke Progressives Union, the flagship group for indigenes of the town. Mrs Gbadegesin and his son, Reuben, were reportedly shot dead by some gunmen, who invaded Alapata village in the Ife North Local Government area of the state on Tuesday. The incident immediately led to tension as some aggrieved residents, in protest, took the corpses of the deceased to the palace of Ogunsua of Modakeke. After they were prevailed upon, the protesters, it was learnt, also took the corpses to Oke Otubu Divisional Police Station, Modakeke, from where the bodies were taken to the morgue. Commenting on the incident, the spokesperson for Modakeke Progressive Union, Venerable Debo Babalola, explained that only a thorough investigation would deescalate tension caused by the killings. He said, “The two people killed are; Reuben Gbadegesin, the son and his mother, Titilayo Gbadegesin. Mrs Gbadegesin was a produce buyer, while his son, said to be her first child, was due to travel out of the country. “Some of her colleagues in the village may know what happened and who did it. Alapata village is in Ife North Local Government Area.” The Osun Police Command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, who confirmed the incident, said the woman and her son were murdered on their farm in Alapata village by yet to be identified persons.
