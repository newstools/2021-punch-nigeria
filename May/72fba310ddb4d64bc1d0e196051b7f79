US comedian, Dave Chappelle, has expressed the desire to star in some movies produced by the Nigerian movie industry, popularly known as Nollywood. He said this while fielding questions during his appearance on the Joe Rogan Podcast. “I have this weird idea. I want to go to Africa and do some of these Nollywood movies,” the comedy legend said. “I’ve been watching them, and how people can solve problems with so little resources. “This is what these African directors are like. The movies look crazy but it’s funny how crazy they look. “But it is also inspiring because I can’t believe this guy with no resources solve complicated filmmaking problem with this type of ingenuity because they had to. “What if there is a reputable American star to apply these tricks to? “I come with this funny; you just give that look. Don’t you worry, it’s all going to work out. “I want to do that, I want just to see what’s popping over there. Africa is popping right now.” Chappelle stated that he doesn’t think he needs a script to star in a Nollywood movie because of the way they are. “I don’t know that I need one. You have to see one of these movies to see what I’m talking about,” he said. “It’s like something about it makes me feel joyful when I watch it.”
