The member representing Nasarawa Central Constituency in the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ismai Danbaba, has been abducted by gunmen. The Chairman, House Committee on Information in the Assembly, Mohammed Omadefu, confirmed the development to our correspondent on Sunday in Lafia. Omadefu explained that his colleague was kidnapped on Saturday while traveling to Jos, Plateau State, to attend a workshop for Nasarawa legislators. He said the incident took place around a forest in the Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State. “He was traveling and had already passed Andaha in Akwanga LGA, heading to the forest area in Sanga LGA of Kaduna State, when the kidnappers ambushed and took him away,” he added. Omadefu, who represents Keana State Constituency, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, told our correspondent that the kidnappers had made contact with the Assembly, but yet to demand ransom. Danbaba came into the assembly last year on the platform of the APC through a bye-election. ”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
