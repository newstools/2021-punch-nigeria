The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to use electronic transmission of results in 2023 general elections and subsequent polls. In its Tuesday statement titled, ‘INEC has no excuses on electronic transmission of results’, the PDP demanded a transparent online voters registration and called for the implementation of online transmission of results. “The party’s position is predicated on INEC’s announcement of its readiness to conduct online (electronic) registration of voters for future elections in the country,” read the statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. The PDP posited that since the INEC has made a move to conduct online registration, the commission should also deploy technology to transmit election results. “Our party calls the attention of the commission to the fact that it no longer has any excuse not to employ the direct transmission of results from polling units, which will ensure credible elections by eliminating manipulations, alterations, switching, and disappearance of election results during manual collation processes. “The PDP insists that if INEC can use the electronic platform for registration of voters it could as well deploys the same technology for electronic transmission of results in future elections including the 2023 general elections. “Our party however urges INEC to ensure that the online registration of voters is credible, transparent, and not open to the manipulations of desperate politicians, particularly in the All Progressives Congress,” the statement read. PDP further called on all Nigerians to work together in making the election a success. “We, therefore, urge Nigerians to intensify their efforts in the collective quest to rescue our country from misrule by adding their voices to the demand by our party for electronic transmission of results in future elections and particularly, the 2023 general elections,” the statement concluded.
