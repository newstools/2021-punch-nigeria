Organisers of Yoruba Nation Mega Rally scheduled to hold in Osogbo on Saturday have warned hoodlums to stay away from the venue of the event. They also advised security agents against attempt to stop the event. A statement issued on behalf of the organisers signed by Oba Adetoyese Olakisan, the convener of Kiriji Heritage Defenders, and obtained on Friday in Osogbo, said the rally was not to launch an attack on anyone, but was meant to sensitise people on the need to join agitation for total freedom for the Yoruba nation. The organisers also promised to co-operate with security agents and ensure the lives and property of residents remain secured before, during, and after the rally. “Like previous rallies held to garner support for Yoruba nation, the rally is being organised by Omo Oduduwa United in collaboration with Ilana Omo Odudua. “We also urge security operatives that may want to stop the rally not to give such action a thought. We are law-abiding citizens and we will not do anything against the Constitution.
We are ready to co-operate with security agents to ensure the lives and property of residents remain secured before, during and after the rally. “Hoodlums, touts and any individual that have different purposes should please stay away from us. We will not hesitate to hand over such a group of people to the constituted authorities.
We are not attacking, disturbing, and destroying anything but to sensitize our people on the need to support the agitation to have total freedom for the Yoruba nation,” the statement added.
