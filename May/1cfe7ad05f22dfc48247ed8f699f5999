Richvest 360 said it has launched a platform to provide profitable investment opportunities for Nigerians. A statement by the company on Monday said this would provide affordable and accessible banking and investment opportunities for Nigerians. The Head, Operations, Richvest 360, Tobi Dada, said, “Many Nigerians today live below the poverty line not necessarily because they have low incomes or poor salaries, but perhaps they lack a savings and investments culture. “The Harmonised Nigeria living standard survey reports that Nigeria spends about N25bn daily on food items. “There is high propensity to consume but low propensity to save. This is quite alarming for a developing nation. High consumption would mean low savings, low investment, and low capital formation.” Dada added, “There are a lot of investment companies that have made investment easy and provided a lot of people with smart ways to grow their money. “Richvest 360 is one of the leading investment companies in Nigeria that offers people opportunities to build their financial legacy by providing multiple sponsorship channels in the industry of your interest.” The company said it was looking at empowering several young Nigerians with the platform. It stated that with over 5,000 users and 3,000 active users, it had successful projects that had been completed, which were opening more investment opportunities for the users. Copyright PUNCH.
