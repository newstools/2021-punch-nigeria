Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on Tuesday sacked the State Executive Council, directing all commissioners to hand over to the permanent secretaries in various ministries. This dissolution of the executive may not be unconnected to the 2023 governorship race that is currently causing ripples in the state. Speaking after the Executive Executive Council meeting presided by the governor, the immediate past Commissioner, Mr Charles Aniagwu, said that the governor had dissolved the exco. He said, “Today, Governor Okowa dissolved the State Executive Council and directed all the Commissioners to hand over to the permanent secretaries. “Also, all SSAs have been directed to hand over to the next senior officials in their various offices. The dissolution of the EXCO today has nothing to do with the 2023 election. “Okowa believes that there are other Deltans who can also make useful contributors to ensure nothing stops his stronger Delta agenda.” Aniagwu also stated that the state government has dismissed one Bernard Onomovo, a servant working in the ministry of finance as a result of the illegal inclusion of fictitious names into the state’s payroll.
