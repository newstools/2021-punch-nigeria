ZOLA Electric, a renewable energy provider, has said its goal is to provide power to a million homes in the country and cover the energy deficit with innovative and cost-efficient clean energy. The Managing Director, ZOLA Energy Nigeria, Olufemi Ashipa, said at a press exhibition that the company was intent on deploying its technology to the Nigerian market to reduce fossil fuel consumption in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. Ashipa said, “Our products are affordable, as we have products and plans targeted for every market segment. We have two products in the market, Flex and Infinity. “Our pay-as-you-go solutions are attractive to our distributors because as the proprietary manufacturer, and with our business-to-business model, we save costs related to salesforce management and operating expense overhead.” According to Ashipa, the company’s flagship product, Infinity, comes with a Lithium Ion battery and a five-year warranty. He said, “Infinity contains a 2.3KVA battery in addition to a 1.2KVA output. It is also scalable and modular, so extra boxes give you additional power.” “Our solar panels generate both AC and DC, so customers can use power directly from the panels, and the batteries. We have an app through which the customer and the distributor can both track performance in real time and resolve problems remotely.” ZOLA also stated that it conducted extensive training for its distributors on market entry, business setup, customer acquisition and monetisation. “We want our partners to make money and do business easily, so we put in these efforts to make sure they succeed.” Copyright PUNCH.
