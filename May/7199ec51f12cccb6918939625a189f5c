Paxful has assured Nigerians that their crypto investments are safe. This is coming after an alleged probing of Binance by the US justice department and internal revenue service. Although the company refused to comment directly to PUNCH on Binance’s alleged probe, it said, “Paxful cannot comment on Binance’s alleged probe as we’re not privy to the specifics. “What we can say is that safety is a concern of all financial companies and law enforcement agencies. “Paxful was one of the first peer-to-peer platforms to implement an Anti-Money Laundering programme and have dedicated significant resources to our compliance programme and department. “Paxful cooperates and works with local and global law enforcement agencies on inquiries and any prevention measures. “It’s important that we collaborate as an industry to share learnings – Paxful does this informally and also by being part of organisations such as Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative’s Cryptocurrency Consortium and the Crypto Defenders Alliance.” Nigeria is Paxful’s biggest market. The PUNCH had reported that the company was expecting 23 per cent more crypto traders from Nigeria on its platform than what it recorded in 2020. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
