A multinational company, Tiens Group, has called for support for orphans and vulnerable members of society. The General Manager, Tiens Nigeria, Mr Michael Yang, said the firm believed everyone could maximise their potential if given the needed help. Yang spoke on Tuesday during a visit of the company to the Little Saints Orphanage, Lagos State. He said, “Tiens has always subscribed to the philosophy of serving society by restoring health to mankind and actively committing to corporate social responsibility. We have been in Nigeria for about 21 years now and within the period helped thousands of Nigerian families maintain optimum health through our super health products. “We chose the orphanage for visit because we wanted to remember the underprivileged, give back to society and help those in need. We want to give back to the orphans and hope they can remember us and be their best. So far, Tiens Group has donated more than $240m to charity and public welfare projects worldwide.” The health and wellness company donated food items, some of its products and cash to the home. The administrator of the Akowonjo home of the orphanage, Mrs Tina Odiong, encouraged couples having delay in childbearing to consider adoption. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
