The fourth Luik Tennis and Recreation Club Members Tennis League ended at the weekend at the club’s courts in Lekki, Lagos with former Super Eagles captain, Austin Okocha, the star attraction. The 1994 AFCON winner played an exhibition match against another celebrity, Dare Art-Alade, shortly before the final matches in the men and women’s singles events. Okocha and Art-Alade were cheered on by fans during the entertaining exhibition match. In the men’s singles, Emelie Okika defeated Rume Dubre 7-5, 6-2 to lift the title, while Betsy Eze defeated Mobolaji Ogundairo in straight sets 6-4, 6-2 to win the women’s singles event. The most explosive match of the day was the men’s doubles final between Rume Dubre/Godwin Kienka and Tope Aremu/bayo Oguntunde. After losing the first set 6-4, Dubre and Kienka won the second set 6-3, before going ahead to win the tough decider 11-9. Manager of Luik Tennis Recreation Club, Joseph Ogar, said, “We’ve had loads of fun during the tournament. People were eager to play and the excitement was wonderful because of the bragging rights and the love of the game. “I want to thank our sponsors – Nigeria Breweries Limited under brand, Amstel, ARM Pensions and Redbull- they were really supportive. We are happy and hope the next edition will be better.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
