A man, Chika Uba, has died after taking his 32-year-old girlfriend, Amaka Joseph, to watch a football match on Adeniyi Jones Avenue in the Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State. PUNCH Metro gathered that Uba went to pick Amaka from her residence on Ogunsolu Street, Cement area of Ikeja, and they both went to watch an English Premier League match between Chelsea and Leicester City at the Runway Bar on Adeniyi Jones Avenue. After the match, it was learnt that Uba took Amaka back to her residence, but the story took another dimension when he got to her residence and allegedly started behaving strangely. It was learnt that Amaka sought the assistance of her neighbour, Macaulay Justice, who helped in rushing Uba to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, for urgent medical attention. However, Uba reportedly died on the way as one of the doctors on duty at the hospital pronounced him dead on arrival. It was learnt that on Sunday, May 16, 2021, Amaka reported Uba’s death at the police station, where she explained that her boyfriend started behaving strangely five minutes after their arrival at her residence. When PUNCH Metro visited Ogunsosu Street on Sunday, some of the residents of No. 40 A and B said nobody bearing Amaka or Macaulay resided there. The residents, who spoke to PUNCH Metro, said they were unaware of the incident. However, it was gathered that Uba’s family members refused to press charges. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said the case was reported to the police, adding that the command had commenced investigation into the matter. “The case was reported to the police and we are still investigating it,” he said. ”Copyright PUNCH.
