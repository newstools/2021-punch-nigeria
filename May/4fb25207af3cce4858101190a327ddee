The National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association, and the Payment and Clearing Association of China have banned financial institution and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions in China, Reuters reports. The country has banned institutions such as banks and online payments channels from offering clients any service involving cryptocurrency, such as registration, trading, clearing and settlement. The financial institutions said in a joint statement, “Recently, cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and plummeted, and speculative trading of cryptocurrency has rebounded, seriously infringing on the safety of people’s property and disrupting the normal economic and financial order.” The firms also warned investors against speculative crypto trading. Although China had banned crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings, it has not barred individuals from holding cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, it was reported that China was in advanced development stages of its national digital currency, a project it has been working on since 2014. The People’s Bank of China has been spearheading work on the digital yuan, a so-called central bank digital currency that aims to replace some cash in circulation. China would be the first nation in the world to float a digital currency if it succeeds. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
