The Federal Capital Territory Command of the Nigeria Police Force on Tuesday said none of its stations in the nation’s capital was attacked. A video had surfaced earlier in the day, claiming that one of the police stations in the FCT had been attacked and set ablaze. But the spokesperson for the command, Mariam Yusuf, in a statement said the command had no record of such incident. She said, “The Police Command of the Federal Capital Territory wishes to debunk a viral video in the social media suggesting that a Police Division in Abuja was attacked and set ablaze by hoodlums. “The command wants to state categorically that there is no record of such incident in the FCT. ” She enjoined the public to cooperate with the Police and other security agencies by providing prompt and useful information rather than circulating messages capable of causing undue panic amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT. Yusuf reaffirmed the resolve of the command towards the protection of lives and property within the Federal Capital Territory.
