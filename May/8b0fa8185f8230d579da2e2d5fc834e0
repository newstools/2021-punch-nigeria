Sunshine Stars coach Gbenga Ogunbote is confident the Akure-based side won’t be relegated at the end of the Nigerian Professional Football League season despite their miserable run, The PUNCH reports. Ogunbote’s side are without a win in their last 14 matches losing seven, with the other seven ending in stalemate. Sunshine are 17th on the log, three points above the relegation zone with 20 points from 21 games. “If we keep this level of competitiveness we have a chance of avoiding relegation,” Ogunbote said. “We’ve been unlucky in some of the games but I believe we can kick-start our season when we play against IfeanyiUbah on Sunday. “Our performance has been consistent, the difference is that we have not managed to score and win games.” Highest goals scorer, Sadeeq Yusuf, on loan from Plateau United, added, “It’s been a tough season and we’ve been struggling to win games. “But I’m hopeful that we will end the long wait for a win soon.” Jamiu Alimi, who rejoined the club on a short term deal till the end of the season, said the club’s priority was to ensure they secured their topflight status. “Of course wins give the team confidence and we want to achieve that in the next games and keep picking up more points.” Copyright PUNCH.
