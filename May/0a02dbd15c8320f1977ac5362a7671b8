The Lagos State Government has promised to ensure a sustainable industrial harmony in the state by continuously dialoguing with labour leaders. The Lagos State Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Mrs Ajibola Ponnle, made this known during an open training session for labour leaders with the theme, ‘Strengthening Trade Union Leadership, Mitigating the Challenges and Fostering Sustainable Industrial Harmony for More Development and More Prosperous Lagos State,’ held in Ikeja, Lagos. Ponnle, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Establishment and Training, Dr Abiodun Onayele, said labour leaders in the state should always opt for dialogue with the government as a means of resolving their grievances instead of resorting to incessant strike. Commending the industrial harmony enjoyed in the state in the last two years, Ponnle pointed out that such was due to the proper management of situations and creative approaches of the leadership of the state to labour union issues. She said, “Lagos State would continue to maintain that relationship, and more important, no request or suggestions made by the union leaders would be swept under the carpet.” Also, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Labour and Industrial Relations, Babatunde Williams, enjoined all participants to be attentive. He said, “Other plans to ensure the labour leaders are professionally and industrially equipped would soon be unveiled.” The guest speaker at the training, Prof. Shola Fajana said, “Trained, visionary and strong leaders will beneficially impact their organisations by being able to inspire the people to buy into the visions crafted by the leaderships.” Copyright PUNCH.
