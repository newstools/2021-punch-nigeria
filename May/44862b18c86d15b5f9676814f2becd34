The International Seafarers’ Welfare & Assistance Network, the Mission to Seafarers, Stella Maris, Sailors’ Society and other charities have raised $299,000 in seven days in aide of seafarers devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The PUNCH had reported that leading seafarer welfare charities and shipping industry players had launched an emergency relief fund to support seafarers who had been devastated by the rampant COVID-19 pandemic in India and other countries. It also reported that as of press time on May 7, the amount donated by respondents had hit $61,508. Three days after, the donations have hit $299,794, from 95 respondents. The group plans to raise $1m to address the current economic hardship facing the global maritime industry. Lending his voice to the effort, Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping, Esben Poulsson, said, “We have all been shocked by the images and stories coming from India and our hearts go out to the people of India and those from India working around the world that are suffering from the impact of this pandemic. “It often takes a crisis to bring people together and this is no different. The fact that seafarer charities have come together signifies the scale of the challenge before us in the short term and looking further ahead. “I am calling on ship owners and all those engaged in the maritime sector to support this initiative and consider increasing your contribution to seafarer charities at this time.” He added that when faced with significant challenges, the maritime community always come together.
