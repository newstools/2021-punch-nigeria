Sotheby, an American multinational corporation that auctions fine art, has said it will start accepting cryptocurrency for its auctions. The company, one of the world’s largest auction houses, made this known on Tuesday. It said it would begin accepting Bitcoin and Ethereum via Coinbase. The CEO of Sotheby, Charles Stewart, made this known on CNBC. “As you may recall, we did our first NFT sale a few weeks back. We had over 3,000 bidders participate in that sale series and so it made us think that we need to take this next step and begin to accept crypto as payment for physical art as well.” Sotheby is the first auction house in the world to accept crypto in exchange for physical art. This market-defining arrangement paves the way for further adoption of cryptocurrency across the physical art world. The decision to accept cryptocurrency via Coinbase comes on the back of the success of ‘The Fungible’ Collection, Sotheby’s debut NFT sale, which made more than 3,000 unique collectors, majority of whom were first-time buyers with the company. In a statement available on the company’s website, Stefan Pepe, Sotheby’s Chief Technology Officer, said, “With the growing adoption of digital art and NFTs, along with our increased focus on digital innovation, we’ve seen an increasing appetite among collectors for more seamless payment options when doing business with Sotheby’s. “Leveraging the trusted exchange Coinbase is a natural progression and is in line with our dedication to enhancing our client buying experience and developing new ways to expand our client base by meeting them where they are.” The decision to accept crypto by the company is an important step for the crypto world, especially after the S&P Dow Jones Indices launched its first three cryptocurrency indexes on Monday. The S&P crypto indexes are poised to normalise bitcoin and ether data on Wall Street.
