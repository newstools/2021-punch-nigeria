The Lagos State Government has said that a total of 360 youths in the state have been trained in the breeding of honeybees, as well as fish production. The Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr Wale Ahmed, said this on Tuesday at the press briefing of the ministry to mark the two years in office of the state governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in Ikeja. Ahmed disclosed that the Centre for Rural Development of the ministry organised programmes to engender development in less-developed communities across the state, including training youths in bee and fish management. He said, “The Ministry, through one of its centres; an apiary (bee farm) in Igbodu-Epe has trained 235 youths on breeding of honeybees for honey collection. The centre also trained 125 youths in the last one year on fish breeding and management.” Ahmed described apiculture as a sustainable means of creating wealth for youth population in the state. “The centre has obtained approval of the governor to expand the bee project with 50 new beehives. “The resultant effect of this is that more youths will be trained and engaged, thereby ensuring wealth creation in the state,” he added.
