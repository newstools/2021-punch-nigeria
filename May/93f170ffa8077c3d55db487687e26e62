The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has on Tuesday flagged off Operation Restore Peace in the Enugu State to contain the rising insecurity in the South-East region. This was coming barely 24 hours after the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Enugu State was attacked and properties set ablaze by yet-to-be-identified gunmen on Sunday night. The PUNCH gathered that the launching of the operation was in compliance with the National Security Council resolutions of May 11, which approved a new security measure for both South-East and South-South geo-political zones. The council which was headed by President Muhammad Buhari gave the go-ahead to review security strategy to contain the menace in the zones. South-East and South-South regions have in the recent time witnessed surging security challenges ranging from attacks on security facilities, personnel and recent attacks on the INEC offices.
