PALPABLE fear has gripped some communities in the Gwarzo Local Government Area of Kano State following reports of the presence of bandits in some major villages of the area. It was gathered that residents of Getso, Kutama and some other neighbouring villages were currently living in fear as a result of the report that the hoodlums were seen moving in and out of the areas. The military had already deployed its personnel to Gwarzo and other neighbouring villages in readiness for any eventuality, according to the spokesman of the Nigerian Army 3 Brigade Kano, Capt. Njoko Irabor. He told newsmen in Kano on Wednesday that the military and other sister security agencies in the state were on top of the security situation in Kano, adding that there was no cause for alarm. “You know we are doing routine security operations in and around Kano together with our sister security agencies and our men are everywhere as such no course for alarm,” he said. Meanwhile, the Chairman of Gwarzo LGA in Kano State, Bashir Kutama, has ordered the restriction of vehicular movements from 11pm to 5am in all parts of the LGA as part of measures to enhance security in the area.
