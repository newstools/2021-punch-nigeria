Barely two weeks after a driver and some passengers were kidnapped, another four travellers have been abducted along Ayetoro-Ilara Road in Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State. They were reportedly abducted on Tuesday night at Olubo Village while travelling from Abeokuta to Ilara in the Yewa-North Local Government Area of the state. The Residents of Olubo, Idi Emi, Imeko-Afon, Ilara protested and blocked vehicular traffic, which left so many travellers on the road stranded. This is also coming less than a week after a businesswoman, Roselyn Edusi, and her guest were abducted in Omu, Ofada in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent gathered that five other passengers who were travelling in the same Toyota Avensis Commercial SUV with number FFF 654 TK were, however, spared. One of those spared, Rofiat Oladeinde, while narrating her experience said the incident occurred around 8pm on Tuesday night. She said they were accosted by four gunmen, who shot into the air repeatedly. She added that the kidnappers abducted the driver and three women who were selected randomly among the passengers. They said the abductors spared one Fulani and two Hausa passengers among them. Oladeinde said in Yoruba, “They collected our money and our handsets before they led the captives into the forest.” Meanwhile, the Assistant Commissioner of Police of the state Police Command, Muritala Bolanle, who visited the scene of the abduction at exactly 12 noon in a police helicopter marked 5N-GEJ, promised that they would arrest the abductors. He said, “We are going after the abductors, that is why we are here. We shall definitely get them.”
