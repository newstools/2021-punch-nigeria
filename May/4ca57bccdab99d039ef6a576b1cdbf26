Checks by PUNCH Metro revealed that the victim was one of seven students of an almijiri school, who were injured in the explosion that occurred at a filling station adjacent the school. It was also learnt that while some of the injured were receiving treatment at the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, others were patronising traditional healers to treat their burns. When contacted for confirmation, the spokesman for the Kano State Hospital Management Board said he was not aware of the death of any of the victims. A fuel tanker had exploded last Saturday while discharging its content into an underground tank at the Al-Ihsan filling station in the Sharada Industrial Area of Kano metropolis. Governor Abdullahi Ganduje had said after visiting the scene, “Henceforth, any fuel station operating in the state without standby fire fighting equipment risks prosecution. “I have directed the state fire service to prosecute owners of filling stations, who do not have functional fire fighting equipment. The state fire service must undertake routine inspection of filling stations to ensure that they comply with all safety standards, so that lives and property are not endangered.” The governor also ordered the agency to conduct regular seminars for employees of filling stations to educate them on best practices in fuel management and fire prevention. ,Copyright PUNCH.
