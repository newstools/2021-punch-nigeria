The Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Brig-General Buba Marwa (retd.), has directed members of the agency’s Directorate of Intelligence to track and apprehend fraudsters behind scam messages being sent to job seekers in the name of the agency. The agency’s Director, Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday titled ‘NDLEA disclaims messages demanding payment from job seekers.’ Babefemi said the fraudsters pretending to be representatives of the agency were demanding payments from unsuspecting members of the public as a means of including them in the employment list of the NDLEA. “Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. General Mohamed Buba Marwa (retd.) has directed the agency’s Directorate of Intelligence to track and apprehend fraudsters behind the scam messages,” the statement read in part. The agency, therefore, advised candidates scheduled for screening as narcotic officers and narcotic assistants in Abuja and Jos from next week and other job seekers not to fall for the scammers. The statement added, “Our attention has been drawn to some messages being sent round to some shortlisted candidates and other job seekers to make payment into some phoney bank accounts to secure them employment slot. “Of particular interest is a message that reads: ‘You are to come with medical certificate of fitness, guarantor form, credentials, registration slip and writing materials to ndlea academy katon rikkos, lamingo road jos plateau state. Name Ali Imran Musa/Acct No 2191549625 Bank Name U.B.A Bank/Phone No 07084068948.’ “Shortlisted candidates, other job seekers and the general public should please note that the NDLEA will not ask for payment from anyone seeking to work in the agency and are therefore urged to discountenance this fraudulent message and similar ones.”
