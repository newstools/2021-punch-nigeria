The Enugu State Police Command, on Monday, said it had launched a manhunt for the killers of a former State High Court judge, Justice Stanley Nnaji. Justice Nnaji was allegedly killed around the Ebeano Tunnel bypass by gunmen on Sunday. A statement by the command, however, did not identify the victim as a former judge. The statement was titled: ‘Murder of an unidentified man: CP orders full-scale manhunt for assailants, says they must be fished out and brought to book’. It read, “The Commissioner of Police, Enugu State Command, Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, has ordered the launch of a full-scale manhunt for yet-to-be identified armed assailants alleged to have trailed and shot dead an unidentified man driving in a Mercedes Benz SUV, which they carted away, along Ebeano Tunnel, Enugu, on Sunday, May 30, 2021, around 5pm. “The victim, whose true identity has yet to be ascertained, was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead by doctors on duty and his remains deposited in the mortuary for autopsy.” The statement signed by the command’s spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, quoted the CP to have given an assurance that no stone would be left unturned in fishing out the killers. He appealed to residents of the state to remain law-abiding, vigilant and assist the police with useful information that would lead to the arrest and prosecution of the assailants. Justice Nnaji was a judge of the Enugu State High Court until he was dismissed following his role in the removal of the then sitting governor of Anambra State, Chris Ngige, in 2007. Copyright PUNCH.
