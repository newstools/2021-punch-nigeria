Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has declared Friday as work free day to enable Muslim faithful continue with the Eid-el-Fitr celebration. The Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, announced this in a statement on Thursday. He said the decision was in consideration of the fact that Wednesday, May 12, which was part of the two-day Eid holiday declared by the Federal Government fell within the 30 days of Ramadan period. “The governor felicitates the Muslim Ummah on this auspicious period that calls for sober reflection and sharing of goodwill among adherents,” the statement said. It also urged people in the state to use the occasion to pray for peace to continue to reign in the state and the country in general. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
