Malnourished children in Enugu State may lose their lives unless something drastic is done to stop the impending doom, the state Nutrition Officer, Primary Health Centre, Mrs Henrietta Ugwu, has said. She explained that the three Community Management of Acute Malnutrition Centres in the state, where malnourished children were kept for treatment, were running out of Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs). Ugwu expressed worry that more malnourished children were being referred to the centres daily. She stated these on Thursday in an interview with our correspondent. According to her, 1000 cartons of RUTFs donated to the state by the United Nations Children’s Fund and other donor agencies are almost exhausted and need urgent replenishing. She said, “As we speak now, the 1000 cartons given to Enugu State are exhausted.  We need to scale up. There is a need for the centres to be set up in every local government of the state, not only at the three centres. “More malnourished cases are being reported daily and now we are short of the food supplement.” Copyright PUNCH.
