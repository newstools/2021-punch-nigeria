A middle-aged man was involved in a crash on Monday while trying to escape with a motorcycle he allegedly snatched from a man in the Alagbaka area of Akure, the Ondo State capital. It was gathered that the deceased, alongside one other, snatched the motorcycle from the owner at gunpoint. A source said, “Nemesis caught up with the robber as he crashed in front of a restaurant in Alagbaka. After snatching the motorcycle with his accomplice, the owner cried out for help and other motorcyclists in the area, who saw what was going on, began to chase after the robber. “It was in the process of escaping that the robber crashed the motorcycle and passed away on the spot.” Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, said he was uncertain if the deceased was a victim or a robber as the other suspect escaped. Ikoro said investigation into the incident had commenced. It was gathered that the remains of the deceased had been deposited in the morgue of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Akure. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
