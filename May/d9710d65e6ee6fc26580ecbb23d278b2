Nigeria’s only individual Olympic gold medallist, Chioma Ajunwa, believes Ese Brume can follow her footsteps and win the women’s long jump gold medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Ajunwa, who spoke with our correspondent after Brume broke her 25-year African long jump record, expressed delight at having someone finally surpass her feat. “I feel so happy; I thank God that after 25 years my record is finally being broken. I know now that we have some people working. Without the help of anybody, the girl kept working and this time around, she has broken the record,” Ajunwa told The PUNCH. “I pray she keeps her head down till the Olympics and repeat it again. “That will now allow us to have another gold medal in the Olympics. If she can jump 7.17m, even 7.12m in the Olympics, I believe she will win gold,” Ajunwa added. The PUNCH had reported that Brume leapt a distance of 7.17m at the Chula Vista Field Festival in California to break the 7.13m record set by Ajunwa on her way to winning gold at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games. The Brume’s is the World Lead in the women’s long jump event. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
