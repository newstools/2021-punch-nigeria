GUNMEN again on Wednesday set ablaze a rented divisional police station in Etim Ekpo Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and killed one officer. The officer, a police constable, Edogi Bassey, was shot dead by the hoodlums during an exchange of fire in a desperate attempt to repel them. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Odiko Macdon, who confirmed the attack in a statement in Uyo, said the hoodlums drove into the station in two vehicles loaded with dangerous weapons, including AK-47 rifles, and opened fire. According to the statement titled ‘Police repelled attack at police stations’ only a small portion of the building was torched. The statement read in part, “At about 6:30am today, armed men, in their numbers, armed with AK 47 rifles and other dangerous weapons, in two vehicles attacked the rented building housing the Etim Ekpo Area Command and Division. “The undaunted and vigilant police officers on duty, gallantly fought back, repelled them and averted the intended carnage. Unfortunately, a dedicated officer, one PC Edogi Bassey, paid the supreme price while a small portion of the building was torched. “The gunmen who proceeded to Ika Division to perpetrate their nefarious activities were successfully again repelled, leaving the station intact without loss of lives or arms.” The statement indicated that the worrisome situation was being addressed by the police hierarchy and required the collaboration of all. It noted that Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, had visited police formations and had called on law abiding citizens to volunteer timely information that would enable the police to tackle the present security challenges in the state.
