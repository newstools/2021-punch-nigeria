The Defence Headquarters has challenged Civil Society Organisations in the country to put the same pressure being mounted on the armed forces on terrorists in the country. The Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, made the call on Monday in Abuja. Irabor spoke at the opening of a three-day training on African Commission Guidelines on Human Rights in Counter Terrorism Operations, organised by the Centre for Strategic Research and Studies of the National Defence College in collaboration with the Open Society Initiative for West Africa. He said the conflict could be easily resolved when the same pressure is brought on the adversaries, adding that this would also reduce the carnage being perpetrated against innocent citizens. He said, ‘“What I need to put forward to you (human rights organisations) and of course the rest other actors within the human rights system is that oftentimes you find out that greater attention is given to the government forces that are dealing with terrorism with little or very minimal attention being given to the adversaries, the Boko Haram and the ISWAP. “I believe the conflict can be easily resolved if or will be resolved faster than this if the same measure of pressure being brought on the government forces to respect Human Rights Commissions is brought on the adversaries to the extent that conflicts of such nature can be resolved, thereby reducing carnage being perpetrated against the innocent citizens, who in the first place are even aware of the contending issues that gave rise to the conflict.”
