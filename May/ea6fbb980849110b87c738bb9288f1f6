The acting Managing Director/Chief Executive, Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, Dr Kelly Nwagha, has said that its 18-storey building, when completed, will create jobs and improve economic and commercial activities. Nwagha stated this on Saturday when the agency handed over documents for the commencement of the building project to the new contractor, Old English Consolidated Limited. In a statement, he explained that the construction of the structure, located along the Lagos international route linking Nigeria and the ECOWAS region commenced about 39 years ago. He added that when completed, it would be put into effective use for employees and employers all over the federation. Nwagha also said people in the community were sure of getting jobs, both the formal and informal types. “This project will impact on the economic and commercial activities of the people, which is part of the Federal Government’s plan to ensure improved living standards, and social vices and insecurity minimised,” he said. He said the project commenced as far back as 1982 and the reason the project was sited in Lagos was the state government’s intention to decongest the state and expand development towards the hinterland.
