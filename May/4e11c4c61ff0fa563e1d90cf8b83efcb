A renowned scientist and Vice Chancellor of Elizade University, Ilara-Mokin, Prof. Olukayode Amund, has called on government at all levels to place more emphasis on applied research. He added that such would make Nigerian economy to experience the expected boost that can improve its citizens’ wellbeing. Amund made this remark on Wednesday during his induction ceremony as a fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science in Abuja. He lamented the abysmal pace at which Nigeria’s technology was developing, saying, “Science is not being encouraged as it ought to be in Nigeria. Even though the government, as a policy, is favouring the study of science as against the humanities in our schools, the economic climate is not aiding the fulfilment of government’s aspiration in this regard.” Amund lamented that the lack of funding for scientific researches in Nigeria was having a ripple effect on the country’s economic development. He described research as the bedrock of development and asked for more synergy between the private sector and the academia. He noted that most foreign multinationals that do business in Nigeria only see the country as a sales outlet and would rather sponsor research in their home countries than give such supports to local researchers.
