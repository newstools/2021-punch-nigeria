The General Manager of the Lagos State Office of Disability Affairs, Mr Oluwadamilare Ogundairo, on Thursday, said people living with disabilities were critical to governance, hence the need to include everybody so that all could contribute meaningfully to the progress and development of any ministry, department and agency they find themselves. Ogundairo stated this at a one-day workshop for senior officials in local government administration on the Lagos State Special Peoples’ Law and Inclusive Governance at the grass roots. The general manager said the workshop was organised to re-orientate all tiers of government on the need to make use of the recommendation of law, especially in tandem with the government’s policy of inclusion. “In day-to-day running of all ministries, departments and agencies, leave no one behind in decision making. They should not be discriminated against as far as decision making is concerned in such MDAs,” Ogundairo said. He urged the heads of the different MDAs to create a conducive environment to accommodate all the people living with disabilities and display equality and equity. Copyright PUNCH.
