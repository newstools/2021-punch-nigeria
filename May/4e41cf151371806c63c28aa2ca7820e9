Enyimba striker Tosin Omoyele says the Aba side won’t take Pyramids for granted when both sides face-off in the first leg of their quarter-final match of the CAF Confederation Cup at the 30 June Air Defence Stadium in Egypt on Sunday. The Peoples Elephant advanced to the knockout stage after defeating Orlando Pirates 1-0 in their final Group A game in April to finish top of the log with nine points. Two-time African champions Enyimba are the favourites for this tie, but Omoyele, in a chat with Saturday PUNCH, said they had been training very hard ahead of their game because of the pedigree of the Egyptians. “We have been training very hard for this game. We cannot afford to be complacent at this stage of the competition because we are getting close to the final. “We don’t want to leave anything to chance because we are not ready to start struggling against them in the second leg. “Pyramids are a big side and we will not take things for granted against them,” Omoyele said. The reverse fixture is scheduled for May 23 in Aba. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
