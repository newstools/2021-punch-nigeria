THE decision of the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, to sack 20 out of his 28 Commissioners, sent shock waves across the state, on Wednesday. The sacking of the 20 Commissioners came barely one month after the governor reshuffled his cabinet and appointed new Commissioners for Finance and Health. Members of the State Executive Council, who survived the latest purge include the commissioners for Health, Youth and Sports, Tourism, Information and Strategy, Woman Affairs, Works, Finance and Technology. Uzodinma, two weeks ago, accused some of his appointees of sabotaging his administration. Our correspondent gathered that the unceremonious dissolution of the cabinet took most of those affected by surprise because most of them reported for duty as usual and were at their desks when the announcement relieving them of their appointments was made. Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Nwachuku Oguwike, who confirmed the development to The PUNCH, said, “The news is correct; 20 commissioners were affected, while eight were not affected. The reason is to infuse new blood and add more value to the governance system of the state.” When contacted, the state Commissioner for information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, also confirmed the development.
