Radio broadcaster and human rights advocate, Ahmed Isah, commonly called ‘Ordinary President’, has apologised for striking a lady on camera. Isah, who hosts the popular Brekete family show on Human Rights Radio Abuja, was outed on Monday by a BBC Africa Eye report which showed how Ordinary President violated the rights of some persons brought before him for investigation. The video also showed Isah physically assaulting a woman identified as Susan on his show. The woman in question had been alleged to have physically abused her six-year-old niece, burning her hair after branding her a ‘witch’. The report by BBC Africa Eye had sparked an outrage, with many Nigerians chiding the radio personality for his untoward behaviour. On Wednesday, Isah apologised for his actions, claiming that he was driven by “passion”. He said, “I apologise to everybody that I have offended in one way or the other. Please, I’m a human being. I’m bound to make mistakes. I was triggered by the zeal and passion in me. As a human being, even computers tend to malfunction, there is blood flowing in my veins, I tend to get emotional sometimes. “Whenever I do anything out-of-control on the basis of emotions, I always apologise when I realise it and correct the mistakes. For those disappointed in me, please forgive me. For those I have offended, please find a place in your heart to forgive me. I’m only but a human being. “I know some people will say that there is nobody that sent him to do human rights work, forgetting that government organisations that are supposed to get justice for ordinary Nigerians are not doing their work.” Isah also announced plans to quit the Brekete show after the month of May. “I do not know how this will sound to you all. I did not consult with anyone but by the first of next month (May) we will stop the programme; since the programme is their problem.”
