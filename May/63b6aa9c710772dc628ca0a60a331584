Cardiff defender Sol Bamba has revealed that he is now cancer free after battling Non-Hodgkin lymphoma since late last year. Bamba revealed this good news in a Twitter statement on Wednesday, spurring jubilations from his fans. The former Leicester City and PSG player was said to have been diagnosed with the illness last December but a public announcement was made in January. Since then, the 36-year-old Ivorian had undergone a series of chemotherapy sessions and had been off the field during the period. His announcement on Twitter was, therefore, received with a lot of celebration. “Hey everyone, just a quick message to inform you that I’m now cancer-free! It is of course incredibly heart-warming news for my family and I, we are over the moon right now,” he wrote. He further appreciated those that supported him through his trying times. “I really want to thank each and everyone that has been supporting me, whether it’s been with a comment, a message, a like, or whatever, that definitely gave me extra strength to go through this. “Above all, I want to thank the family at the NHS who took such good care of me, I will always be grateful for your job. “Thank you to all my family, my friends, and of course the club and everyone in the football industry that has helped me face this challenge. I wish you all a blessed day and hopefully will see you soon again on the pitch,” Bamba wrote. The defender appeared on the field this month as a substitute on the final day of the Championship season, playing for just a few seconds before the match ended. His announcement is a confirmation that he is now back on the field.
