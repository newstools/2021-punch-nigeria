About 300 players will slug it out as the 2021 Nigeria Table Tennis Federation National Championships begin at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos on Tuesday. Speaking at the tournament’s press conference on Monday, Chairman, NTTF Caretaker Committee, Ishaku Tikon, said the tournament served as an opportunity to identify talents who would take over from the likes of Quadri Aruna, Funke Oshonaike, Olajide Omotayo and Segun Toriola. “For the next five days from tomorrow, (today), we are going to be witnessing explosive contests among the players and we believe we can identify more Quadri Arunas, Olufunke Oshonaikes, Segun Toriolas, among others in the tournament. “This competition is another avenue for our national handlers to identify some talents that will form the bulk of our national teams at junior and senior levels and we hope we can use it again to gauge the players in terms of their ranking.” Tournament Director Tayo Adesoji said, “We are aware of the quality of play in Edo and Abuja and for us, we want to continue to raise the bar by staging the national tournament so that our players can showcase their talents for the national handlers to identify them.” The tournament features 12 events, which includes cadet, U-21, senior and veterans and will run for five days, with a prize money of N4.5m.
