Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the legislative arm of government must ensure that adequate budgetary allocation is made for public health emergencies. Osinbajo, who was represented by the Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, spoke during the 4th annual legislative summit on health in Abuja on Monday. He also said that the COVID- 19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of the country’s health system while also commending the health workers for their commitment across the country most especially by restoring already declining outpatient consultations in the first four months of the pandemic. He said “The attainment of the Universal Health Coverage for all Nigerians and especially for the most vulnerable Nigerians is at the heart of the human capital development initiative of this administration. “Our experience in the last one year of COVID in Nigeria has exposed the vulnerability of our health system and the importance of preparedness, diagnosis and response mechanism. “However, there are different understanding of what is meant by the concept of health security. “One of such proactive steps is to ensure that there are funds set aside always and which can be made available whenever there is a public health emergency. “Such fund should only be utilised when a public health emergency is declared, while the legislature must ensure that adequate budgetary allocation is made for preparedness activities.” Osinbajo added that public health security requires proactive and reactive measures to minimise the danger and impact of acute public health events such as immunisation, family planning and keeping sight of other diseases like malaria.
