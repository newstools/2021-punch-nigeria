The League Management Company faces a race to end the 2020/21 Nigeria Professional Football League in order to be able to present representatives for continental club competitions for the 2021/22 season. Our correspondent gathered that the Confederation of African Football sent letters to football associations across the continent asking them to send names of clubs taking part in the Champions League and Confederation Cup latest June 30. The letter however sent confusion within the country’s football sector, as the league was just halfway, with eight weeks left before deadline. The NPFL have gone on a mid-season break since April 2, to resume on May 9. While on break, Enyimba, are playing their outstanding games due to their continental engagement. Our correspondent gathered that the LMC will meet with the 20 NPFL clubs in Abuja on Thursday (today) to determine the next line of action. “Yes, we are meeting in Abuja tomorrow (Thursday) to look at what will happen with the league,” a source told The PUNCH. The Chief Operating Officer of the LMC, Salihu Abubakar, didn’t pick our correspondent’s call, while text messages sent to his line for his comments on the issue were unanswered as at the time of filing this report.
