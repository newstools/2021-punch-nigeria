THE Sokoto State Government has reiterated the need to restructure and reposition vigilante groups in the state to enable them to strengthen and assist the subsisting Federal Government security outfits in the state. This, according to Governor Aminu Tambuwal, becomes necessary in the face of pockets of security breaches experienced recently in Rabah Local Government Area in the eastern flank of the state. The governor disclosed this on Monday at Gandi town, Rabah LGA of the state, where bandits clashed with some local vigilante groups, leading to the death of 21 persons. “We are going to restructure and reposition the vigilante groups in Sokoto State. We are going to make sure that we provide them with motorcycles and communications gadgets so that they can be communicating with security agencies effectively; and for them to provide basic information and guide to the security agencies,” he said.
