Darnella Frazier, the teenage girl who filmed the harrowing death of George Floyd, has spoken out about the experience a year after the incident. In a Facebook post titled “1 year Anniversary”, the 18-year old, who was at the scene of the incident when she was 17, wrote about the trauma and grief that became a part of her life after witnessing the death. Narrating the events of the day before she encountered the scene, she said it was just another day for her as she walked with her nine-year-old cousin to the corner store, unprepared for events that followed, which changed her life. “It changed me; it changed how I viewed life. It made me realise how dangerous it is to be Black in America,” Frazier said. According to her, days after the event, her family had to constantly be on the move as nowhere seemed safe for them. She wrote, “Having to up and leave because my home was no longer safe, waking up to reporters on my door. Hopping from hotel to hotel because we didn’t have a home and looking over our backs in the process. Having panic and anxiety anytime I saw a police car, not knowing who to trust because a lot of people are evil with bad intentions. If it weren’t for my video, the world wouldn’t have known the truth. My video didn’t save George Floyd, but it took his murderer away and off the streets.”(sic)
