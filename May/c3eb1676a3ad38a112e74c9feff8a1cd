Supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party, under the aegis of Anambra PDP Renaissance Group, have cautioned the party against fielding politicians who had a history of defecting from the party in the November 6 governorship election. The group said its membership was drawn from politicians, who had remained with the PDP through thick and thin. This was contained in a statement signed by the President and Secretary of the group, Dr. Mckizit Ukadike and Mr Kingsley Odibendi respectively. They declared support for the aspiration of Senator Ugochukwu Uba. The statement read in part, “Senator Ugochukwu Uba’s undivided loyalty and whole commitment to the PDP since 1999 is worth rewarding as a deterrent to party members who often abandon the party in difficult times and move on to other parties, only to return after the party had survived without their help, just to use the party to further their ambitions.” Copyright PUNCH.
