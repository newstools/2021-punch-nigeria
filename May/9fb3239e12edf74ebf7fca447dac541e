The Vice-Chancellor of Trinity University, Yaba, Lagos,  Prof. Charles Ayo, has told the new matriculating  students to uphold the tenets of integrity, discipline and sacrifice in all their pursuits. Ayo who was speaking at the third matriculation ceremony of the school said these tenets were necessary for them to achieve academic excellence and become stars in their endeavors. “To the matriculating students, I am convinced that you can picture a glorious future ahead of you. Remember, also, that there is no star without a scar. The scar of any star is discipline and sacrifice. You must be obedient and go the extra mile to become a star in your field.” “Remember, you cannot feature in the future you cannot picture. At TU, we make you see possibilities in the midst of impossibilities, we help you actualise your dreams,” he said. He added that TU was a school on a mission to raise young men and women who would rescue Africa from the decadence it had been plunged into by weak leaders. The Pro-Chancellor of TU, Mr Samuel Olatunji, also enjoined parents to always reinforce all what the school stood for. “Parents will need to understand and reinforce what we stand for and ensure there is harmony between home and school, especially as anti-social and delinquent behaviour are so rife and spreading fast everywhere. Students should be conscious that they are at the centre of it all and are the greatest beneficiaries of the image and respect our university earns. They carry our certificates for life. By the grace of God, the Governing Council will take the lead in walking the talk and support other stakeholders to discharge their own responsibilities.” 182 students matriculated at the ceremony.
