Team Lagos Taekwondo Poomsae gold medallist at the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival, Aminat Idrees, has given birth to a baby girl, The PUNCH reports. The athlete and her husband, Nurullah Matepo, both confirmed the arrival of their baby. According to Nurullah, Idrees put to bed on May 21 at the Surulere General Hospital, Lagos. Idrees turned poster girl of the festival last month, after pictures and videos showing her competing with pregnancy and winning gold in the taekwondo event went viral online. In a chat with The PUNCH, Idrees said, “Our baby has arrived and she is doing great.” Nurullah said, “It is a thing of joy to finally have our baby. “Both the mother and the baby are doing fine; there is no medical issue or complication. So, it is something to be happy about.” He added, “Eyebrows were raised when she competed at the sports festival with the pregnancy but I would have been a selfish husband if I stopped her, when I knew she could do it. At the 2018 festival, she won two silver medals and a bronze, so it is not new to her and it wouldn’t have made sense to stop her. “A lot of people that raised eyebrows didn’t know what the medical experts said about her condition. They didn’t know the consultations we had before the Lagos State Sports Commission allowed her to compete. A lot of meetings were held to ensure she would be fine before she was allowed to go for the festival.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
