Unitrust Insurance says it has launched a new integrated marine portal designed to deliver consistent positive experience across all its interactive platforms. A statement on Friday said during the launch of the portal at the head office in Lagos, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, John Ijerheime, said the interactive portal was a strategic attempt to improve the firm’s brand equity and the associated customer experience that delivered on the promise. “We have restructured our business, invested in our people and in our overall operational efficiency in line with leading practice standards,” he said. He noted that with multi-channel interaction becoming the new normal, the need for cross-channel integration could not be overstressed, giving its customers excellent options to transact business at their convenience. The managing director added that the company was leveraging its contact centre platform and technology to deliver an experience that spanned multiple channels without a break in customer dialogue. The Executive Director, Technical, Mrs Yetunde Adenuga, said, “Unitrust Marine Portal delivers customer experience with limitless relevance, personalisation, and value – and you can set it up in minutes. Never forget that our five-star support team is at your disposal 24/7. “We offer unique solutions to manage marine risk, providing flexible, robust cover against loss of or damage to ships, vessels, and cargo from the point of origin to the destination.” Unitrust Insurance was licensed and authorised by the Corporate Affairs Commission and the National Insurance Commission in 1986.
