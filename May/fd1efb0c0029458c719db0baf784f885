The Commissioner for Banjul Accord Group Accident Investigation Agency, Mr Charles Erhueh, has said air transport is extremely important as it guarantees connectivity. He said this at the basic aircraft accident investigation training in Cabo Verde on Monday. The training, which started on Monday, is expected to last for nine days. Erhueh said, “Air transport reduces insularity and allows the exploitation of the global market. “The relevance of the aeronautical sector has come to be recognised and manifested through the major investment made in the improvement of airport and air navigation infrastructures.” According to him, the sector enhances construction of a system for regulations, supervisions, inspections, prevention and investigation of accidents and attendants safety recommendations in the aviation sector. “Civil aviation guarantees the safety of air operations, dynamises the market and accommodates the growing number of flights, passengers and goods,” he said. Erhueh said considering the alignment of Cabo Verde with the objectives defined in the creation of the institute for the prevention and investigation of aeronautical and maritime accidents, embodied in the aviation development strategy itself, and with that purpose, the headquarters of BAGAIA was installed. He said the realisation of the training was configured as one of the actions that would contribute to the awareness and familiarisation of national technicians, air safety investigators in the region and professionals in the collective and individual safety measures. “The training will guarantee the prevention of accidents and therefore, enable the consolidation of operational safety and security,” he added.
