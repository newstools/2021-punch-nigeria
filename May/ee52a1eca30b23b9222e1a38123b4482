A 48-year-old man, Awurum Eze, has been arrested by security operatives in Aba, Abia State. Eze is said to be the second in command to the suspected IPOB/ESN terrorist leader neutralised by security operatives. According to a statement on Wednesday by the Director of Army Public Relations, Mohammed Yerima, the suspect was arrested after he had earlier escaped when the Intelligence Response Team stormed his village where he went to hide. The statement titled, ‘Security forces arrest another IPOB/ESN terrorists’ henchman’ read, “The second in command to the neutralised IPOB/ESN terrorist leader Ikonso, Awurum Eze, has been nabbed. “The 48 years old Awurum Eze, a native of Umoneke Nta, Isiala-Mbano LGA, Imo State, had on May 4, 2021 escaped when operatives of Intelligence Response Team stormed his village house in Isiala Mbano where he was hiding. “Intensive manhunt was thereafter launched towards tracing and arresting him. He was eventually apprehended on Wednesday, May 12, 2021, in Aba after weeks of unrelenting follow-ups by operatives. “Awurum Eze is one of the main sponsors of the numerous killings in Imo State and has been on the wanted list of security agents for more than three months. Many of the arrested IPOB /ESN terrorists had earlier mentioned him as their key sponsor, mastermind and second in command to the late Ikonso. “According to them, among all their leaders in Imo State, only Ikonso and Awurum have direct communication link with Nnamdi Kanu. He can be seen in several photographs posing with the fugitive terrorist leader, Nnamdi Kanu.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
