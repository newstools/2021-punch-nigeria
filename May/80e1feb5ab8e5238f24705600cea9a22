THE House Committee on Public Petition has commenced a probe into an alleged fraudulent payment of compensation to impostors claiming to be owners of residential buildings and churches marked for demolition in Gyadna community, Abuja. The committee has also summoned the Gyadna community leader, Mr Jubril Hassan, and Federal Capital Territory Development Authority officials, who were said to be complicit in the alleged fraud. As part of its fact-finding, some FCDA officials visited the community on Monday where they interviewed landlords who were either short-changed or not paid their due compensation allegedly because they were not Abuja indigenes. The summons/hearing notice addressed to Hassan dated May 6, and signed by the committee Chairman, Jerry Alagboso, directed the District Head to appear before the committee on Thursday (today) to explain his alleged involvement in the matter. It reads, “You are hereby required to note section 88 and 89 (C) of our constitution (as amended) and appear before this committee on Thursday, May 27, 2021, at 2pm or as soon thereafter as the committee shall direct.” Twenty-one landlords had in a petition to the Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, alleged that some Gyadna indigenes led by Hassan connived with some top officials of the FCT Department of Settlement and Compensation to divert the compensation meant for them because they were not Abuja indigenes.
