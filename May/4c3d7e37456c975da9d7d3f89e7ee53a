ISRAELI Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday said despite diplomatic moves to end the hostilities with Gaza fighters, there was no obvious end in sight. Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip entered its seventh day with air raids early on Sunday killing at least 47 Palestinians, wounding dozens more, and flattening at least two residential buildings. The home of Gaza’s Hamas chief, Yehya al-Sinwar, was also targeted, according to the group’s media. In Israel’s Tel Aviv, people dashed for bomb shelters as sirens warning of incoming rocket fire blared across the city, according to the BBC. According to a statement from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry, at least, 188 people, including 55 children and 33 women, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in the past week. More than 1,200 others have been wounded. “In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have killed at least 13 Palestinians. Ten people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks on Israel, Israeli officials say. Israel’s army chief said Hamas “misjudged” the strength of Israel’s response when the group first launched seven rockets from Gaza at Jerusalem almost a week ago. “Hamas misjudged the strength of our response,” said Aviv Kochavi, the army’s Chief of General Staff, saying Gaza had since been enduring an aerial bombardment of unprecedented “intensity.” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, however, told the UN Security Council in an online meeting on Sunday that hostilities in Israel and Gaza were “utterly appalling” and called for an immediate end to fighting.
