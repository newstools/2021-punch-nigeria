There was tension on Friday at the Abattoir community in the Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State following the arrest of a Lebanese said to be using underage girls to act pornography. The man whose name was not immediately known was said to have been arrested by some youths on Thursday night and taken to the Abbatoir police station for interrogation. However, the youths who returned to the station on Friday morning to know the fate of the Lebanese alleged that he was nowhere to be found. They accused the police of releasing the suspect in questionable circumstances, a development which caused tension in the community. One of the angry youths, who gave his name only as John said, “We have an issue about a Lebanese man using girls of age 10-13 to act pornography. He was arrested yesterday (Thursday) but now he is nowhere to be found and the policemen are saying nothing about it. “The police have refused to release the girls in question. So there is uproar around the station because the youths insist that the girls must be released and that the man must not go free.” It was gathered that It took the reinforcement of security personnel to disperse the angry youths who had mobilised and started throwing stones at the police station. However, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Ubah Ogaba, who confirmed the arrest of the Labanese said he was still in their custody. He said, “We have not released him. He is still in our custody but the case has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation. Calm has also been restored to the Abbatoir community.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
