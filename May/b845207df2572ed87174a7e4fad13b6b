Former Super Eagles stars Nwankwo Kanu and Emmanuel Amuneke have expressed their disappointment at not seeing Nigerian trio Victor Osimhen, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi iheanacho qualify for the UEFA Champions League with their respective clubs, The PUNCH reports. The trio missed out on Europe’s most glamourous football competition on the final day of the season. Leicester City duo Iheanacho and Ndidi were broken as they missed out of Champions League qualification on the last day of the season after losing 4-2 at home to Tottenham Hotspurs on Sunday in the EPL. In the Serie A, Napoli drew 1-1 with Verona on the final day, but it was not enough to secure UCL place, with dethroned champions Juventus claiming the final spot instead. “It’s so sad not to see the three of them and their teams qualify for the Champions League, but anything can still happen if they change clubs,” Kanu said. Amuneke added, “Losing out when it matted most is the painful aspect of it. I hope they get into the competition either through transfer to a team that will feature in the competition next season.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
