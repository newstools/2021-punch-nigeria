THE Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, on Tuesday, threatened to sack any appointee found to be corrupt. The governor issued the threat while inaugurating four boards of government agencies namely: Civil Service Commission, Local Government Service Commission, Imo State Internal Revenue Service and Imo State Universal Basic Education Board. The event held at the Exco Chambers, Government House, Owerri. Uzodinma said, “Let me use this opportunity to advise you and all in this government that I will not hesitate to relieve you of your duties if you are found wanting. “You are expected to take consequential decisions on behalf of this government. That means you must manifestly consciously toe the line of honour in the discharge of your duties. “While I welcome you to our share property government, let me make it absolutely clear that your appointment is a call to serve the people of the state. “In the past, government appointees usually saw their appointment as an opportunity to come and loot This is a different area. We have come to change.” Uzodinma noted that before the appointments were made, the appointees were properly screened after passing through a rigorous selection process. Chairman, Civil Service Commission, Mrs. Juliet Onyeukwu, who spoke on behalf of the appointees said, “We are going to work with honesty, impartiality and objectivity. I want to assure you that the appointees will not let the governor down.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
