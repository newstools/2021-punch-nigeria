The Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos State chapter, has commended the action taken by the Lagos State House of Assembly in the suspension of three local government council chairmen over their disregard for the rules and underperformance. This was expressed in a statement by the Lagos PDP spokesman, Taofik Gani, on Sunday. Recall that Ogidan Mukandasi Olaitan of the Lekki Locsl Council Development Area, Suleiman Jelili of the Alimosho Local Government Area and Tajudeen Ajide of the Surulere LGA were suspended by the House for consistently flouting the local government guidelines. Gani said, “As a matter of fact, 85 per cent of these council chairmen have nothing to show for being in office. Their council areas are so underdeveloped and apparent mismanagement and high-handedness exist. So the Speaker did well to deliberately set up a ‘service delivery’ committee of the house to specifically act as a monitor for the councils, parastatals, agencies, ministries and contractors. That way, the Lagos State House of Assembly’s oversight function will be expanded and purposeful.” Gani also affirmed that the PDP would participate in the  local government poll schedule for  July “with the determination to win if Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission allows free, fair, credible poll.” “We are impressed by the large turnout of aspirants in our party. We have enough to choose our first eleven from,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
