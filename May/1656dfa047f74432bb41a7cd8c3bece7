The Indigenous People of Biafra has faulted the arrest of Ikonso’s second-in-command, Mr Awurum Eze. The secessionist group, which denied the identity of Eze, described the claim by the Nigeria Army as a blatant lie, adding that security operatives sold a dummy to unsuspecting members of the public. The group, in a statement signed by its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH, boasted that the group was not moved by such cheap propaganda and blackmail. Recall that the Nigerian Army, in a statement on Wednesday night, claimed that it arrested late Ikonso’s second-in-command in his hideout at Aba, Abia State. The PUNCH reports that Ikonso was the commander of the Imo State chapter of the Eastern Security Network and was allegedly killed by security agencies last month. But IPOB, in the statement, said, “The Indigenous People of Biafra, ably led by our great leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, read with utter amusement, media reports of claims by the Nigeria Army that it arrested Ikonso’s second-in-command in Aba. “This is a blatant lie and cheap propaganda to lay false claims to imaginary military prowess. The said man is not an operative of ESN. Such a man is too old to be recruited into ESN, let alone being Ikonso’s second-in-command. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
