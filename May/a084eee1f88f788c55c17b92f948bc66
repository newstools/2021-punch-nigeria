The All Progressives Congress in Oyo State has berated Governor Seyi Makinde over insecurity in the state following the kidnap of the wife  of the youth leader of the party  in the state,  Dr Aderiyike Oni-Salawu. Our correspondent gathered that the victim, who is a medical doctor, was on her was home when the incident happened. She was said to have been kidnapped at around 10.20pm on Sunday in the Aromolaran area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The victim, who was driving  an ambulance, was said to be heading home after closing from work when the gunmen struck. The husband, Isiaka, was said to be driving a car behind the victim and on getting to the gate of their residence, the wife alighted and was about to open the gate when the hoodlums swooped on her and whisked her away. Isiaka, reportedly escaped from the hoodlums. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Adewale Osifeso, said he would get back to our correspondent but was yet to do that as at the time of filing this report. Speaking on the kidnap in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Monday, the acting Publicity Secretary of the APC in the state, Dr Kazeem Olatunde, said, “ We have been saying this for a long time that there is no security in Oyo State but this is another confirmation. People are being kidnapped in almost every part of the state. “Security was not this bad when Senator Abiola Ajimobi was in charge. Governor Seyi Makinde must improve on security situation in the state. As the governor, he must work hard on this because he cannot keep blaming the President. He was elected to protect the lives and property of the people of the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
