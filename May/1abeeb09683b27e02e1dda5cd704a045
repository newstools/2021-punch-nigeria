The CEO, Monimichelle Group, Ebi Egbe, has called on the Federal Government to work on the bad roads in the country, following a video released online by Egyptian club Pyramids, which showed the bad state of the Port Harcourt-Aba Federal Highway. The Egyptians, who were in Aba for their CAF Confederation Cup quarter-final second leg tie against Enyimba on Sunday, posted a video of their trip by road from the Port Harcourt to Aba. The North Africans sent Enyimba packing from the CAF Confederation Cup after a 1-1 draw, as they advanced to the semi-finals on 5-2 aggregate. Egbe, whose outfit constructed the Enyimba stadium turf, stated that the state of the road was a bad advertisement for the country, noting that the Egyptians deliberately painted the country in bad light by releasing the video to the world. “That video by Pyramids is a wake-up call for us to not only fix our stadiums, but also fix our roads. Teams that come to Aba to play have always commended the playing pitch. We need to get it right on all fronts. This is why I’m appealing to the Federal Government to get our roads fixed. Our teams would return to the continent next term and it would be a shame if teams from other countries that are far less endowed than us come in and mock us because of the bad state of the country’s roads,” Egbe said.
