BENUE State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has accused opponents of the resolution by Southern Governors to ban open grazing as harbouring a hidden agenda. Ortom said this while speaking during the ‘Media Week and Communications Day 2021’, organised by the Catholic Diocese of Makurdi, at Holy Ghost Parish Hall, Makurdi, on Thursday. He commended his colleagues from Southern Nigeria for towing the right path towards addressing insecurity in the country. The governor said, “Open grazing is no longer feasible in the country due to development and population growth.” Ortom noted that it will be difficult for Nigeria to attain its full potential without the safety of lives and property of its citizens. He expressed gratitude to the citizens and residents of Benue State for their support for his administration. The governor  gave a hint about his administration’s plans to commence the teaching and learning of local languages in schools owned by the state in the next academic session. Earlier, Catholic Bishop of Makurdi Diocese, Most Rev Wilfred Anagbe stated that social communication was meant to uplift humanity and the society, adding that it was a positive aspect of the reality of life and not the other way round. The Catholic Bishop  who advocated teaching of history and vernacular in primary and secondary schools in the state said language defines a man and so should not be allowed to go into extinction.
