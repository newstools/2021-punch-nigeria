The All Progressives Congress in Oyo State has said the party is in court to file a suit seeking to stop the local government elections scheduled for Saturday from holding. The Publicity Secretary of the APC in the state, Kazeem Olatunde, said this in a telephone interview with our correspondent in Ibadan on Thursday. He said, “Our lawyers are already in court as I speak with you, they are filing papers to make sure the council election is postponed. “We are waiting for the outcome of that. We believe the court will answer us.” The APC had insisted that conducting the poll without their candidates was wrong. The party said it decided not to participate initially because the case filed by the elected local government officials was in court and rushing to organise another poll without waiting for that to be determined is wrong. The Chairman of the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission, Isiaka Olagunju ( SAN), had said the opposition party was given notice and that he personally went to the APC Secretariat to persuade them to participate in the poll but he said they spurned the opportunity. The Supreme Court had on May 7 delivered the judgment in the case and ordered that the elected council officials should be paid all their salaries and allowances since May 29, 2019, when Governor Seyi Makinde dissolved them.
