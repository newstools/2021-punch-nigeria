Banjul Accord Group Accident Investigation Agency, an independent body in the West African aviation sector, has said the flight safety laboratory of Nigeria’s Accident Investigation Bureau can provide technical support to other West African countries. The BAGAIA had announced last week, through its commissioner, a proposal of $1.5m integration for flight data analysis for its member states. The Commissioner, Charles Erhueh, during a visit to the Guinean Civil Aviation Authority, said the member states, namely The Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Cape Verde, Liberia and Sierra Leone, would be provided with a core analysis capability with the AIB’s existing FDR/CVR safety lab as the central hub for expert technical support. In an interview with our correspondent on Monday, Erhueh said in executing the proposal, the agency had showcased AIB’s safety lab as one worth emulating. He said, “BAGAIA plan is to project the world-class facility of AIB Nigeria in terms of flight safety laboratory so that African investigators going overseas like America or Europe for the download of the Flight Recorders, Cockpit Voice Recorders, Flight Data Recorders, etc. look to Nigeria’s AIB and believe that we Africans (Nigerians in particular) can do it. According to him, BAGAIA is expected to be one of the best regional accident and incident investigation agencies in the world in the near future, with improved aviation safety recommendations.
