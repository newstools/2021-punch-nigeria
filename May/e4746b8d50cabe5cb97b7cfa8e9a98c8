The Nigeria Table Tennis Federation has staked N4.5m for the 2021 National Championships scheduled for May 18 to 22 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos. According to the breakdown of the prize money for the five-day tournament, winners in men and women’s singles events will earn N250,000 each, while U-21 and cadet champions take home N100,000 and N50,000 respectively. Winners in team and doubles events will get N200,000 and N100,000 respectively, with quarter-finalists in each event earning a minimum of N50,000 each. Also, the national technical crew will be present to identify talents that will be invited to national camp in junior and senior categories. Twelve events will be contested for by the players in the cadet, U-21, men, women and veteran divisions. Already, winner of the women’s singles event of the just-concluded Aso Championship, Fatimo Bello, has vowed to continue her dominance at national level. “I’m coming to Lagos to give my best because there are no pushovers in the game anymore. Everybody wants to become the champion, but it is a bit tougher to remain on top,”  Bello, who claimed the singles title in Abuja and the 2020 National Sports Festival in Benin City, said.
