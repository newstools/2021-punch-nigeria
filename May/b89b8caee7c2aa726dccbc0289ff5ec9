Thirteen persons abducted by bandits in Kwakwashi, a community in Niger State, penultimate Thursday, have regained their freedom. It was gathered that while 12 of them were released on Tuesday, the remaining one was freed on Wednesday. The PUNCH had reported that the bandits numbering about 30 stormed the community around midnight, killed one resident and abducted 13 persons. A community leader, Aliu Muhammed, told our correspondent on Wednesday that ransom was paid to secure their release. He said families of the abducted residents paid a total of N6.5m before they were freed. He said, “All the 13 abducted residents have been released. They freed 12 yesterday (Tuesday) and one today (Wednesday). “They held onto the other person because his family did not pay the N500,000 ransom on time. In total, the bandits collected N6.5m.” One of the abducted persons, who did not want his name in print, said, “My experience there is not a pleasant one. We dare not look into their eyes. I discovered the people abducted from Bwari, Dutse and Kubwa and us were kept in the same place, We were flogged like babies. “A lot of us are with scars and some have been in the hospital since they returned. They requested the names and information of other people in the community from us.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
