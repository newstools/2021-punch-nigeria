The Federal Government, through the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, has partnered the Lagos State Government to train public finance managers across the 20 local government areas of the state on the implementation of the international public sector accounting system accrual basis. The Accountant-General of the Federation, Idris Ahmed, who noted that the training had been packaged to bring up treasury officers at the sub-national level up to speed on the practical steps in the preparation and presentation of IPSAS, said most states and councils were behind schedule in the implementation of the IPSAS. Ahmed, who was represented by the Chairman of the Federal Account Allocation Committee sub-committee, Chris Nyong, noted that Lagos State Government had adopted of IPSAS in its accounting processes since 2016. He said, “It is not cheering news to report that only 13 states have so far complied with the directives of the government on migration to IPSAS method of accounting and this is why the Federal Government has mandated this training programme across the country.” The Lagos State Accountant-General, Dr Abiodun Muritala, urged the local government officials to embrace the IPSAS method of accounting, noting that the position of the state’s revenue and its status in obtaining foreign grants and loans were a result of the robust accounting system being used.
