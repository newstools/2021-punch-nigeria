The Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos chapter, has shifted the primaries for its councillorship aspirants to May 28. The Lagos PDP Chairman, Mr Adedeji Doherty, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Lagos on Monday that the primaries, earlier scheduled for May 25, would now hold three days later. Doherty said the move is to enable the party to complete the screening process of the candidates in the forthcoming July 24 local government elections. He said, “Most likely it is going to happen on Thursday or Friday. We opted to move it forward because we have quite a lot of responses in the aspirants for the councillorship seats. “We didn’t think we were going to have that many aspirants, but we have quite a lot. So, our screening procedure has been extended.” Doherty said the party would field candidates from the chairmanship and councillorship seats across the 20 local government areas and 37 local council development areas of the state.
