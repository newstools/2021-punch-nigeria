Some governors in the All Progressives Congress are in Cross River State to persuade Governor Ben Ayade to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party to their party. Some of the governors arrived in Calabar on Wednesday evening ahead of their meeting on Thursday with Governor Ayade. The APC governors expected at the meeting are Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodima, David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State among others, according to Government House sources. It is not certain if Ayade would succumb to the pressure to defect as he has been threatening to do following complaints about the way he is being treated in the PDP.
