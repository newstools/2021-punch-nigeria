The newly established Bauchi Road Transport Agency said it had arrested over 100 commercial drivers for picking or dropping passengers outside designated parks in the metropolis. The Director General of BAROTA, Air Commodore Tijjani Gamawa (rtd.), who disclosed this during a press conference in his office in Bauchi on Tuesday, said first time offenders were made to pay N20,000 each, while second time offenders were fined N40,000 each. He pointed out that the fines were paid directly into the state government’s coffers. While giving a rundown of the activities of BAROTA since its inauguration, Gamawa said over 100 offenders had been arrested and fined, adding that about N4m had been generated by the agency from fines. “All drivers that drop or pick passengers on the way, we have been able to curtail them; we have been able to sanitise the state and this even improved our security situation,” he added. Gamawa said his agency would also relocate 298 illegal traders. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
