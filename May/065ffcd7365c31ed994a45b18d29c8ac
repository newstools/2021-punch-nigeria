Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State says his administration has reduced governance cost by 50 per cent in the last two years. He stated this in a broadcast to mark his second-year anniversary. “We have reduced the running cost of government by 50% and also reduced government overhead cost by 12.3%. This saving in overhead cost has been ploughed back into capital projects which will yield significant economic benefits in the future,” he said. The governor also credited his administration for not reneging on his electoral promises not to increase taxes. “Instead, we simplified the tax payment system, and broadened the tax base to capture the informal sector,” he said. According to him, external debt in the state has been reduced $24 million. “We have been deliberate about borrowing and ensuring we do not accumulate any debt without concrete repayment plans.” The education sector, he said, was improving, as the number of out of school children was reduced by 10% within two years. Access to education was made free, 5000 teachers were employed and school structures were rehabilitated to ensure continued improvement of the sector, he added.
