The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, has called for an immediate investigation into the murder of an All Progressives Congress chieftain, Ahmed Gulak. This, he said, was necessary in order to unravel the motive behind his death, just as he described the murder as barbaric and unwarranted. This was contained in a statement by the Director, Information, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Willie Bassey. The statement was titled ‘SGF mourns death of Gulak’. It read, “The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, has expressed deep shock over the killing of Ahmed Gulak, an APC chieftain and an indigene of Adamawa State while on his way to Chief Sam Mbakwe Airport, Owerri, Imo State, early this (Sunday) morning. “He described the killing of Gulak as barbaric and unwarranted. “SGF called for urgent investigation by appropriate security agency to unravel the motive of such gruesome murder. “He expressed his condolences to the APC family, the government and people of Adamawa State, his family and prays to God to grant the soul of the departed eternal rest.”
