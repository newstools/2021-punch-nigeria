The Adamawa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has raised concern over the increasing debt profile of the state, saying the recent N100bn bond approved by the state House of Assembly is a means to siphon funds for the 2023 elections. The party told Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to concentrate on tackling the non-payment of pensions, promotion dues and arrears, while decrying the absence of basic facilities in the state. The APC caretaker Publicity Secretary in the state, Mr Mohammed Abdullahi, in a statement asked the lawmakers to leave up to their constituents’ expectations and avoid being used as a rubber stamp by the government. He stated, “In 2019 and 2020 alone, the governor through the Assembly collected about N30bn, which cannot be properly accounted for. “The sum of N9bn was collected as loan to execute a housing project of 2,000 units at Malkohi, but the houses are nowhere to be found. “The N15bn collected for the renovation of secondary schools cannot be accounted for, because no single secondary school was renovated. The governor, in his response, said the bond would open up the agricultural sector and help in the employment of about 750,000 youths in the state. He stated that the government had partnered the Arewa Research and Development to explore the huge potential in agriculture and make funds available for the state, not just for the capital projects. Fintiri stated, “The Adamawa agro business bond I think is something that should be celebrated by all, especially in Nigeria. “That is the first time the Securities and Exchange Commission gave approval for a state to borrow from the capital market for agricultural business.” ,Copyright PUNCH.
