THE National Consultative Front, promoters of the mega political movement, on Thursday, called for the inclusion of a clause in the new constitution to allow Nigerians hold a referendum. The NC Front is a political movement under the co-chairmanship of a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Na’Abba and foremost Nigerian Political Economist, Prof Pat Utomi. Head of Secretariat of the NC Front, Olawale Okunniyi, in an interview with The PUNCH, enjoined members of the organisation to take active part in the ongoing constitutional review and also canvassed for the inclusion of electronic voting and transmission of results. While enjoining members of the movement to attend the sessions, Okunniyi said, “We expect that our position at the various zonal public hearings shall be strong advocacy for the National Assembly to amend sections 8 & 9 of the present Constitution to provide for a referendum clause that will allow for National Referendum and Constituents Assembly of Nigerian citizens over provisions in the constitution in such a way that Nigerians can take back their sovereignty and ownership over their Constitution and state. “Other vital points which we shall be canvassed for are; The adoption of electronic voting, electronic counting of votes, electronic transmission of election results as well as biometric electronic accreditation of voters.” Copyright PUNCH.
