The United Nations Development Programme has advocated alternative means of livelihood as a means of curbing the rising insecurity in Nigeria. A consultant with the UNDP for West Africa and member of Nigeria Committee on Small Grant Programme, Dr Chris Ugwu, spoke to journalists on the sidelines of a workshop on ‘Reclamation of Oil Spill Degraded Farmlands through Sustainable Agro-forestry in Egbema, Oghaji/Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State.’ Ugwu argued that the spate of killings and related crimes across the country was the handiwork of idle minds, urging the government at all levels to deploy alternative livelihood means to engage youths in human capital development. He added that human capacity development through alternative means of livelihood would help in reducing the security challenges the country was faced with. The consultant expressed optimism that the projects being funded by the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme through the UNDP in Etekwuru, Abacheke, and Ugada villages in Egbema would engage women and youths to shun negative vices, be productive and make meaningful contributions to society.
