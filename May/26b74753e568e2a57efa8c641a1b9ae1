The Chief of Staff to the State Governor, Terwase Orbunde, who received the defectors on behalf of Governor Samuel Ortom applauded their decision to have jettisoned the APC which he described as a failed political party that could not secure the lives of people and revive the economy of the country. The governor told the defectors that the Peoples Democratic Party was the only political party that could guarantee the security and economic survival of the country and assured them of equal rights and privileges in the party. State PDP Chairman, John Ngbede, expressed delight that the defection of the APC ward chairmen and other top members had weakened the party in Makurdi LGA, stressing that the APC must be voted out of power at the national level to ensure a better Nigeria.

Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Ibrahim Alhassan formerly of the APC Central Mission, and Solomon Kwaghtser formerly of APC Makurdi South said the decision to join the PDP was to team up with the Governor who they noted had done well in tackling the security challenges confronting the state.
