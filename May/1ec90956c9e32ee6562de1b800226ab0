A community development association in Maidan, a border community between Lagos and Ogun states, and a local government council have built a primary health centre for the use of the residents decades after the community came into existence. The project, initiated by the CDA and completed by the Ifo Local Government Council of Ogun State, will serve residents of Legun, Matogun, Olambe, Osere, Koye and environs. Maidan is a settlement after Matogun in the Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State, which is one of the border communities with Lagos like Akute, Alagbole, Olambe, Okearo, Agbado, Ijoko and environs. The Transition Chairman, Ifo Local Government Council, Fatiu Salami, expressed happiness with the project, adding that it would reduce the stress of going to Okearo to access healthcare by the residents. “Contrary to rumours that we took over the project when it was 90 per cent complete, we began work when it was still not plastered,” he stated. The community health practitioner in charge of the health centre told PUNCH Metro that “services in the centre will include immunisation, antenatal as well as child delivery.” Copyright PUNCH.
