Commercial activities came to a standstill on Monday in Owerri as residents deserted the Imo State capital in compliance with the sit-at-home order issued by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra led by Nnamdi Kanu. IPOB, through its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, had said human and vehicular movement would be restricted across the South-East on Monday to mark the 54th anniversary of Biafra. As a result, he said all markets, parks, schools, airports and others would be shut down. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, and the police had also asked the people to ignore the separatist groupâ€™s sit-at-home order. But The PUNCH reports that commercial banks, schools, shops, malls, were all shut in Owerri on Monday morning. Also, commercial and private vehicles deserted the roads in the state capital for fear of being shot by IPOB operatives. Efforts to get the reaction of the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Bala Elkana, proved abortive as his line was switched off as of the time of filing this report. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the House of Representatives suspended its constitution review hearing in Imo and Abia States. The hearing was scheduled to hold in the two South-Eastern states this week. The suspension of the constitution review hearing in the two South-Eastern states followed the sadistic killings and destruction of police states, and other government assets in the two states. Earlier on Sunday morning, the police claimed gunmen said to be IPOB members killed a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak, in Owerri. Gulak was callously murdered while he was on his way to catch a flight at Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri.
