The Confederation of African  Football Referees Instructor Chukwudi Chukwujekwu has warned that the two Nigerian match officials selected for the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand Ndidi Madu  and Mimisen Iyorhe may be technically knocked out of the competition due to their poor knowledge of the Video Assistant Referee, which is presently not in use in the country. Chukwujekwu made this known at the just-concluded C-Diploma Course of Football Coaches Association of African Nations in Akure, the Ondo State capital. He said VAR would be used as one of the major criteria to select the final officials for the World Cup. The well-attended FCAAN course  is meant to keep Nigerian coaches up to date with the new coaching trend. Chukwujeku, who lectured the coaches on ‘The Rules of The Game,’ said Madu and Iyorhe, who were shortlisted  by FIFA for the 2023 Women’s World Cup were on the brink of missing out unless the country took steps to align the duo with some other African countries where VAR was being used, to improve their knowledge  on the usage of the technology. “The nation is already tackling the issue of VAR, and very soon it will be included in our system. The truth of the matter is that VAR is not part of us but we are already tackling it. We’ve held meetings with FIFA regarding these candidates (Madu and Iyorhe), but in the main time we can take the advantage of African nations that already have VAR to train them,” Chukwujekwu stated.
