Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, on Sunday began mobilising the youth in the South-West to support his presidential ambition in 2023. The governor, who was represented by one of his aides, Moses Okezie, at a mobilisation programme in Ibadan  said it was now the time  to ensure a youth was voted in to lead Nigeria starting from 2023. He said Bello, who he described as a detribalised Nigerian had repositioned Kogi State and would make Nigeria a great nation if he becomes the President. Okezie said, “Governor Yahaya Bello has drastically reduced the number of out of school children in Kogi State. If he becomes the President, he will use education to tackle the problem of insurgency and other criminal activities. “His government is the most transparent in the country and the facts are there for anybody to check. He understands that  the next leadership in Nigeria must be youthful and useful.” A group known as Afenifere for Collective Transformation headed by Tolu Ajayi, said the group called on the youth in the South-West to remain politically conscious and support a youthful and useful person to become Nigerian president in 2023. He said, “The call for youths in position of authority is a divine call. The decay in our system can still be restored if we collectively wish this generation well. This is the reason for this name Afenifere.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
