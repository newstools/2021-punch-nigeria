The Lagos State House of Assembly on Tuesday read for the second time a bill to establish a legislative and research institute to foster the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. The Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, said the bill was to entrench an efficient and effective legislative institute in the state and to solve the problem of councilmen who were not provided the opportunity to perform their functions as legislators due to lack of knowledge. He said, “This bill is viable to us and also for other legislatures in service of the parliament and other states can share in it as the centre will be a learning space for councillors and local government chairmen, promoting and deepening democracy in our state. The institute will also engage international legislative bodies like the African Parliamentary Union, where we can acquire more knowledge through the centre.” The member representing Eti-Osa II Constituency, Gbolahan Yishawu, noted that the bill would help new legislative members and workers of the Assembly. The member representing Kosofe II Constituency, Femi Saheed, also described the bill as a total reflection of the situation in the state. “With the population of 25 million people, if we want democracy to be enhanced in Nigeria, we need an institution that will uphold it and this bill will add quality to the lawmakers and enhance democratic tenets, saving cost for the state in terms of education tourism and increase the know-how of the lawmakers elected into office,” he said.
