The Directorate of Public Prosecutions has said a prima facie case has been established against Yoruba actor, Mr Olanrewaju James, aka Baba Ijesha. Recall that the police arrested Baba Ijesha for sexual assaulting a minor in the care of a comedienne, Adekola Adekanya, aka Princess. On Friday, April 30, 2021, the police forwarded the case file to DPP for legal advice. The DPP in a statement on Monday signed by the Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, concluded that a prima facie case had been established against James. It recommended that Baba Ijesha should be charged for the offences, including indecent treatment of a child, which is punishable by nine years’ imprisonment;  defilement of a child, which is punishable by life imprisonment; sexual assault by penetration, which is punishable by life imprisonment; attempted sexual assault by penetration, which is punishable by 14 years’ imprisonment; and sexual assault, which is punishable by three years’ imprisonment. “Irrespective of Baba Ijesha’s rights as entrenched in the constitution, it is expected that the Ministry of Justice would not relent in its efforts in ensuring that every sexual predator feasting on Lagos residents is speedily brought to book,” the statement added.
