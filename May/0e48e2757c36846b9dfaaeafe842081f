The Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, on Saturday condoled with the families and the entire Nigerian Armed Forces over the death of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt General Attahiru Ibrahim, and other senior and junior military officers who died in a plane crash on Friday. In a condolence statement released in Jalingo, Ishaku described the death of the officers as shocking and a big blow to the families of the victims, the military and the nation at large. According to the statement signed by Mr. Bala Dan-Abu Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Ishaku said the late Chief of Army Staff was a highly disciplined officer. “Attahiru was a disciplined officer who assumed the leadership of the Army at a time that Nigerians craved for a change in the military strategy against insecurity in the country. “The death of the Chief of Army Staff and the other victims of the crash at this time has robbed the country of their contributions to this highly sought new strategy in the war against insecurity in Nigeria,” Ishaku said. The Governor prayed to God to grant the souls of the late military officers a peaceful rest and their families the fortitude to bear the losses.
