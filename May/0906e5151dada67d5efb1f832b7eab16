French champions Lille are poised to sign Super Eagles prospect Michael Olise from English Championship club, Reading, according to TEAMtalk. Olise is also on the radar of Chelsea, Arsenal and Leeds United, along with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. The 19-year-old, who has another year on his contract at Reading, scored six goals in 45 appearances for the Royals last season. Olise is seen as an ideal replacement for forward Jonathan Ikone, who is expected to leave Lille this summer. The youngster of Nigerian descent is one of the most highly-rated young wingers in Europe, winning the Championship Young Player of The Year and was also included in the Championship Team of The Season. Lille are also in the race for Bournemouthâ€™s Arnaut Danjuma, the report added. Danjuma was in sparkling form for the Cherries and played a huge role in their top-six finish. He scored 17 times and added seven assists during a sparkling season on the south coast. However, they fell short in the play-off semi-finals, after defeat to eventual winners Brentford.
