Several people were feared killed as local bandits attacked some villages in the Katsina Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. Though sources alleged that suspected Fulani men were responsible for the killings of the villagers, The PUNCH could not immediately confirm this. One of the sources claimed that about 36 people were murdered early hours of Thursday in Shitile, Shikaan, Mbagena Kpav. Another source said over 10 people died. A military source, who spoke with The PUNCH on Friday on the latest attack, also said the killing was perpetrated by the local bandits. “It is true that some people were killed in some villages in Katsina Ala local government yesterday (on Thursday) but it (killing) was carried out by the local bandits in the area.” Asked if the dead bodies were up to 36, the military source said, “No, there is no truth about that but there was killing and it was done by the local bandits there.” Efforts to get the reaction of the State Police Command spokesperson, Catherine Anene, to confirm the report were not successful as she did not pick her calls. The Force Commander of Operations Whirl Stroke, Brig Gen Clement Akpere, could not also be reached on the telephone when contacted. The chairman of the local government, Alfred Atera, had on Monday alleged that over 100 people were killed last weekend by suspected Fulani herders in connivance with gang members loyal to the state warlord, late Terwase Akwaza aka Gana. Atera mentioned the four wards under severe attack to include; Yoyo, Utange, Mbatyu/Mberev and Mbayongo. He told journalists on Wednesday that one of the wards, Utange, he visited after the attack had been deserted but occupied by animals.
