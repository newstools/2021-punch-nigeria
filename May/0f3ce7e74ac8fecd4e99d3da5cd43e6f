The Dangote Fertiliser and Refinery have been identified as crucial projects that would help realise Sustainable Development Goals as well as the realisation of the Africa Union Agenda 2063. The Charge D’Affaires, Embassy of Nigeria in Senegal, A.K Zanna, reportedly mentioned at his office in Dakar while commending the contributions of Dangote Cement’s investment in Senegal and Africa. He said that the realisation of the United Nation’s SDGs would not be possible without fertiliser use in crop production and noted that the 650,000 barrels per day refinery nearing completion in Lagos, would help bridge the supply gap of Premium Motor Spirit, also known as petrol, in Africa. Zanna stated that the AUA 2063 and the UN SDGs were geared towards food production and poverty alleviation, saying that “You cannot promote food production without the application of fertiliser. I believe that the Dangote Fertiliser is going to assist food production in Africa.” He noted that the continent’s increasing population made boosting food production, a crucial need. Zanna said, “To increase food production, there should also be an increase in yield and you cannot get this without the adequate use of fertiliser. So, the plant is coming in handy for the promotion of the AUA 2063 in terms of increased food production.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
