THE Vice Chancellor of Abia State University Uturu, Prof. Oneymachi Ogbulu, has directed that all lectures and interactions be held from 9 am to 4 pm. The directive came after hoodlums kidnapped an unidentified number of students of the university on Thursday. According to the university Registrar, Acho Elendu, “On no account should any lecturer go contrary to this directive as unpleasant consequences await defaulters”. The VC assured the management, staff and students of their protection, stating that “no stone will be left unturned to ensure the protection of lives and property”. Meanwhile, the Abia State Commissioner of Police, Jane Agbede, the state PPRO, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Imo State PPRO, Orlando Ikeokwu, proved abortive as they did not answer calls and text messages put across to them. The affected students were seized at the Ihube Okigwe area of Okigwe-Uturu axis some metres away from the university. The Abia State Government says, it is “currently monitoring the incident that happened in Okigwe, Imo State, which led to the suspected abduction of yet to be determined number of students of the university.” According to Chief John Okiyi Kalu, the Abia State Commissioner for Information, the public and ABSU community are advised to remain calm.
