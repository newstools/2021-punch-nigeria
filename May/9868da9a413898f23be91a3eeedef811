Many residents on the outskirts of Maiduguri on Tuesday evening fled their homes to escape an attack by suspected Boko Haram insurgents. Major streets were deserted and a massive exodus from Jiddari Polo was reported. Some of the fleeing residents told our correspondent that they heard gunshots around their houses and decided to take flight. The gunshots were heard at about 6pm just when the Muslim faithful were about to break their fast. Some military sources said there was no cause for alarm, insisting that the insurgents who tried to penetrate the town have already been dispelled, adding that life is back to normal in the town.
