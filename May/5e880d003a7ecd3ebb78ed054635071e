The Lagos State Government has promised to support men of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service in equipment, capacity building and other areas. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Dr Omobolaji Gaji, stated this while receiving some firefighters at his office in commemoration of the International Firefighters Day. According to a statement on Sunday, Gaji said, “The labour of firemen who died in active duty will not be in vain.” The Director, Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Mrs Magaret Adeseye, said the agency was committed to responding promptly to distress calls at all times. According to her, in the last two years, the service has adopted a holistic approach to fire safety campaigns by engaging the public to adopt positive behaviour, creating community networks and increasing youth involvement. Adeseye urged residents to report fire incidents promptly, adding that such practice would yield prompt response from the agency and prevent destruction of lives and property. “To meet the demands of our growing population as well as enhance accessibility and proximity of the grass roots to fire safety facilities, four additional fire stations are being established to serve the needs of residents,” she added.
