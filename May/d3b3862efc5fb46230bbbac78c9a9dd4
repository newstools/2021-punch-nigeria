The Oyo State Government says it has begun its quest to build a digital economy through massive deployment of ICT infrastructure and digital skills training for civil servants in the state. The Special Assistant to the State Governor on ICT and E-governance, Mr Adebayo Akande, was quoted in a statement as saying that the massive deployment of ICT infrastructure had led to the digitisation of many government services in the last two years of Governor Seyi Makinde’s administration. “In the last two years, we have also rolled out data warehousing and data infrastructure in Oyo state where all Government data and documentation will be domiciled and accessed in real-time,” he said. He added that the state government had also commenced the process of digitising all paper files for complete business process automation while implementing an Open Contracting Data Standard and e-procurement platform for efficient contracting transparency and online procurement. Akande disclosed that the state had also carried out biometric registration and verification of all government workers, pensioners, and ad-hoc staff. The Chief Executive Officer of Presto Integrated Solutions, Mr Chris Okafor, was quoted as saying, “The future-oriented and visionary government of Seyi Makinde deemed it fit to set up a fibre optic network all over the Oyo state secretariat to enhance staff productivity and efficiency.” Copyright PUNCH.
