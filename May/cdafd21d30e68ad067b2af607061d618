THE Kaduna State Government has broken its silence over claims that salaries of political appointees gulp a large chunk of the personnel cost of the state. It noted that contrary to such claims, the chunk of the wage bill was always going to the state civil servants where 31,064 of them earned salaries amounting to N3.13bn, while 337 political appointees got N259m. While breaking down the monthly wage bill, the government disclosed that “93.55 per cent of its N4.49bn total March 2021 wage bill was paid to the state civil servants and that 31,064 of them earned salaries amounting to N3.13bn, while 337 political appointees got N259m.” A statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication to the Governor, Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, indicated that payment for pensions and KDSG contributions to the salaries of primary healthcare workers added another N1.1bn to the wage bill, adding that these bills did not include the wages of local government employees. “The state government’s total wage bill in March 2021 was N4.498bn. That month, the direct salary bill was N3.39bn, as the 31,064 state civil servants earned N3.13bn, while the 337 political appointees were paid N259.17 million. “Other components of the monthly wage bill were: payments of N478.8m to pensioners on defined benefits, N253.72m as the state government’s 40% contribution to the salaries of primary healthcare workers, N197.4m as 8% pension contribution and N173.3m for the  5% retirement benefit bond,”  Adekeye added.
