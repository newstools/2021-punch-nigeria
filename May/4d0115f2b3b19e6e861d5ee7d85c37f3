Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has revealed that she is colour blind and only able to perceive colours in different shades of grey — a medical condition which is known as achromatopsia. The 35-year-old thespian made the revelation via her Instagram page on Tuesday as she uploaded a five-item fun fact list about herself. She wrote, “Fun facts about me:- 1) I am camera shy 2) I am an introvert 3) I respect all but have no fear for none. 4) Never owned a fake account. I think [it’s] for cowards. I will say more to your face than anywhere else. 5) I am medically colour blind. I see colours in different shades of grey.” People with achromatopsia are either partially or totally lacking in colour vision, thus making them unable to perceive colours except in black and white or shades of grey. According to MedlinePlus, the United States’ National Library of Medicine digital information service, achromatopsia also involves “other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity).” MedlinePlus also stated that people with the condition can have “farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia).”
