The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has given reasons he could not attend the meeting of the South-West leaders of the All Progressives Congress, held in Lagos State, on Sunday. The governor said lack of “timeous communication aside mix up, was largely responsible for his inability to attend the meeting.” In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olabode Olatunde, on Monday, the governor said he had thrown his weight behind the outcome of the meeting. The statement read, “Governor Akeredolu would have loved to be present at the meeting for several reasons. Far more important, the issues distilled bordered on the Southern Governors’ Asaba Declaration. “However, a slight mix-up and communication gap had caused his unintended absence even as an earlier engagement had been fixed for Ibadan weeks before the meeting. “Nonetheless, the resolutions reached by the revered leaders at the Lagos meeting are quite commendable and timely; the issues discussed are germane, and are clear indications that men of goodwill are working together to solve the nation’s current challenges. “As one of the leaders of the APC in the South-West, and more so that, he presided over the Asaba meeting of the Southern Governors, nothing could be more spirit-lifting than the outcome of the Lagos meeting on Sunday. “He, therefore, endorses all the resolutions reached by the leaders who attended the meeting.”
