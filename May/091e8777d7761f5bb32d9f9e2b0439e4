The Department of Petroleum Resources has said it will continue in its quest to deepen human capacity and boost skills development in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. The Director and Chief Executive Officer, DPR, Mr Sarki Auwalu, said the agency would continue to play a leading role and provide needed direction for the benefit of the industry. Auwalu said this while receiving the ‘Oil and Gas Innovative Award’ presented to him by the National Executive Council of the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria during its annual conference, according to a statement by the DPR. He assured indigenous oil and gas trainers of increased collaboration towards sustainable human capacity development for the benefit of all stakeholders in the Nigerian oil and gas value chain. He said the DPR would continue to create opportunities that would enhance businesses and investments for all stakeholders by using its service instruments of its licenses that guarantee investments, its permits that enable participation and its approvals that authorise activities.
