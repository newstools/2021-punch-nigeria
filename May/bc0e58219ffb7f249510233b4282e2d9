The Lagos State Government has said it was working to mitigate the scourge of youth unemployment in the state with remote jobs. The Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs Yetunde Arobieke, made this known on Sunday at the Co-creation Hub and Knowlegde Exchange Programme on career, organised for graduate youths at Sabo, Yaba. She said, “With the advent of the new normal in the work space, this trend is gradually being embraced globally. A proffered solution for social distancing is home working at this period.” Arobieke also appealed to unemployed youths to have their minds re-orientated to learn vocational, technical and digital skills in order to face the present realities of the labour market. “Observations have shown that the number of youths seeking employment, particularly white collar jobs, out-numbered the vacancies required to be filled, hence, the need to re-orientate the mindset of the job seekers to imbibe learning vocational and technical skills to be self-employed. “Let me use the opportunity of this occasion to encourage our youth to be technologically savvy, have sound and qualitative knowledge in digitalisation in other to meet up with global trends,” she added. Similarly, Dr Ayo Adeyemi, a panelist at the event, listed several benefits of remote jobs, which included increased productivity, reduced stress, more family time and less time commuting.
