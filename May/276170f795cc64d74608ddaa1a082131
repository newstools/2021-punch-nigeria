The Kano State Hisbah Board has arrested a 40-year-old woman, Salomi Jerome, and her supposed husband, Salomi Igina, for allegedly trafficking a newborn child from Delta State. This was contained in a statement by the board’s Commander-General, Sheikh Harun Ibn-Sina, which was made available to journalists in Kano on Tuesday. Ibn-Sina said the suspects were apprehended by Hisbah officials attached to motor parks, who suspected a foul play. He stated, “On May 15, 2021, our men attached to a motor park arrested a woman, Salomi Jerome, 40, who was with a newborn boy. “She was accompanied by a man, Salomi Igina, 50, whom she claimed was her husband, which we found out to be untrue. “She also pretended to be breastfeeding the baby in order to deceive the public that the baby was hers. “Investigation, however, revealed that the baby was not hers. The baby was bought from a nurse working with a hospital in Asaba, Delta State.” He said the alleged husband contributed N150,000, while the woman contributed N350,000 before raising N900,000 to buy the baby. Ibn-Sina added that the suspects had since been handed over to the police for further investigation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
