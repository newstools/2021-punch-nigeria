The Ondo State Police Command, on Sunday, said it had commenced investigation into the robbery attack on a petrol filling station on Oda Road, Akure. It was gathered that gunmen attacked the filling station on Saturday and stole an undisclosed amount of money. An eyewitness narrated that the robbers, numbering four, stormed the station on two motorcycles around 7pm. “They shot in the air in order to destabilise the workers and scare people away before entering the station’s office and took away an undisclosed amount of money.” Another source said the bandits shot dead one of the workers during the operation. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident but said no life was lost. Ikoro stated, “Truly, the robbers attacked the petrol station on Saturday evening and stole money, but they did not touch or shot anyone. The CP has ordered a full-scale investigation into the incident. “Also, the tactical team of the command has begun the trail of the hoodlums; very soon, they will be arrested.” Copyright PUNCH.
