Men of the Delta State Police Command have rescued a 27-year-old kidnap victim, Jeffrey Emekume, in the Abraka area of the state. The acting Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Bright Edafe, stated this on Wednesday in Asaba. According to the PPRO, information got to the Divisional Police Officer, Sapele Division, that Emekume was kidnapped on the Eku-Abraka Road while driving his Lexus SUV with number plate RSH 716 AX, with the abductors making a U-turn and head for the Sapele Road. Edafe said the DPO swiftly led crack teams into the bush and the hoodlum, who could not withstand the relentless effort of the police, abandoned the victim and fled, while the victim was rescued and his vehicle recovered. He said efforts were ongoing to track and arrest the fleeing suspects. The PPRO added that the three suspected kidnappers, who were earlier beaten by a mob at the Oghara junction, were pronounced dead at the General Hospital, Oghara, on Monday. Similarly, the police have arrested five suspects, who allegedly specialised in vandalising oil pipelines at the Ogulagha Dried Land and seized a lorry with 170 pieces of six-inch pipes. Edafe said, “On May 8, 2021, the anti-crime patrol team of the ‘A’ Division, Warri, while on routine patrol, intercepted a lorry with number plate BDG 358 YA with five occupants. “The lorry was loaded with 170 pieces of six-inch pipes already cut to various sizes; the suspects are alleged experts in the act of vandalising the Federal Government pipeline at Ogulagha. “The five occupants of the lorry, Lukeman Jimoh, 40; Shola Bimigo; Yahaya Ikane, 55; Ebi Yeregha, 41; and Lawal Aliyu, 35, were arrested, while the lorry was impounded.
