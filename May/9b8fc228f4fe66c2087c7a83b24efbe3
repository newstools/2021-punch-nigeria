Members of the National Assembly Joint Committee on Defence and Air Force have travelled to the United States of America to inspect the progress on the Nigerian Air Force A-29 Super Tucano aircraft being manufactured by Embraer Defence Security Incorporated. The spokesman for the Nigeria Air Force, Edward Gabkwet, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Gabkwet said members of the team, led by Senator Michael Nnachi, arrived the USA on Wednesday and were briefed on the progress of work and likely date of delivery. The statement titled, ‘NASS team In USA to assess progress of work on NAF A-29 Super Tucano Aircraft,’ read in part, “While briefing the NASS team, Colonel Authur Ford of the United States Air Force Fighters and Advance Aircraft Directorate stated that 10 out of the 12 aircraft were ready for delivery while two were undergoing modification and integration to NAF specific operational configuration. “He went on to state that six of the aircraft are scheduled to arrive in Nigeria in July 2021 while the remaining six will be delivered before the end of October 2021. “The NASS team was assured that the aircraft, expected to play critical roles in the fight against insurgency and criminality, would be delivered as planned. “Responding, Senator Michael Nnachi commended EDSI for the quality of work on the NAF A-29 Super Tucano. He however queried the long duration of time from the date of full payment to expected date of delivery, which he estimated to be between three to four years.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
