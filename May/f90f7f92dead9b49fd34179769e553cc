The NGX All-Share Index fell to 39,834.42 basis points on April 30 from 40,270.72bps at the end of December. The latest data obtained from the NGX showed that total transactions at the stock market increased by 5.99 per cent from N215.58bn (about $525.21m) in February to N228.49bn (about $560.55m) in March.

The NGX said, “Retail investors outperformed institutional investors by 16 per cent. A comparison of domestic transactions in the current and prior month (February 2021) revealed that retail transactions increased by 101.77 per cent from N53.80bn in February 2021 to N108.55bn in March 2021. “However, the institutional composition of the domestic market decreased by 20.47 per cent from N99.71bn in February 2021 to N79.30bn in March 2021.” Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said on Friday that bearish sentiments dominated the bourse last week, as the bears took full advantage of the gains over the last two weeks in booking profit on bellwether stocks. They said, “With the Q1-21 earnings season now out of the way, we believe a ‘choppy theme’ will be the order of the day as investors keep their gaze on yield movements in the fixed income market. “The bears will likely maintain dominance as the absence of positive triggers will limit buying interest from the bulls. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Copyright PUNCH.
