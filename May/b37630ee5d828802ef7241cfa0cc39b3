Members of the Ijaw Youths Council Worldwide on Friday shifted their protest to the Rivers State office of the Niger Delta Development Commission on Olu Obasanjo Road, Port Harcourt. The protesters chased employees of the commission out of the facility and used palm fronds,  and bottles of alcoholic drinks to block the entrance of the building. Most of the workers ran out for fear of being attacked by the protesters who said they were carrying out directives of the IYC President, Peter Igbifa. This came barely 24 hours after the youths shut the agency’s corporate headquarters along the Eastern By-pass in Port Harcourt. While they stormed the state office on Friday, the Ijaw youths hoisted their flags at the NDDC gate and demanded the sacking of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. The youths started the protest on Wednesday after the 30-day ultimatum given to the Federal Government to constitute a substantive board for the commission expired. IYC’s Information Officer, Eastern Zone, Jim Samson, said nothing was vandalised at the complex as the protest was peaceful. Samson said, “The security agencies are here. We are asking for the removal of Akpabio because the NDDC is under his ministry. He is pushing that the NDDC Interim Administrator, Effiong Akwa, should stay in office for the forensic audit to be completed. “Now the international oil companies are to pay £1.6bn to the NDDC which he wants to control and use for political reasons come 2023. “So, we are saying don’t give them the money. Let the NDDC board be set up so that there will be equal representation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
