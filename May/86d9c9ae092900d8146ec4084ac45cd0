The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Interior and Principal Registrar of Marriages in Nigeria, Dr Shuaib Belgore, on Friday said the ministry has amended the Marriage Act to allow local government areas and area development councils of the Federal Capital Territory to conduct statutory marriages. According to him, the ministry has the right to issue the “only valid and legally recognised certificate of marriage.” He said the amended legal notices had changed the dynamics of the administration and conduct of statutory marriages in Nigeria and has put to rest the lingering disagreement between the ministry and the Local Government Registrars of Marriage. Belgore spoke in Abuja during the 2021 National Stakeholders’ Conference on the administration and conduct of statutory marriages in Nigeria. He said, “The Ministry of Interior is statutorily responsible for the conduct of statutory marriages in Nigeria, licensing of public places of worship for the celebration of statutory marriages, and ensuring that statutory marriages are conducted in line with the Marriage Act Cap M6, LFN 2004 as amended. “It is my utmost pleasure, therefore, to inform you about one of the major achievements of the ministry which is the successful review of the contents of the Second Schedule to the Marriage Act known as the Legal Notices. “The review has brought the Legal Notices in conformity with the present administrative and political realities in Nigeria today while the amendment of other sections of the Marriage Act is ongoing.
