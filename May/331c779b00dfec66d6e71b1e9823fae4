The African Women Fish Processors and Traders Network on Tuesday inaugurated the Nigerian chapter of the association. The event which took place at the Federal Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Victoria Island, had physical and virtual attendees including Mrs Oluwafunmilola Shelika, president of AWFISHNET, Dr Olalekan Oguntade, vice-president, Fisheries Society of Nigeria FSN, Paul Opuama, assistant director of the Federal Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, and Prof. Stella Williams, vice-president, Mundus Maris, among others. AWFISHNET is a continental network of women fish processors and traders drawn across five blocks from member nations of the African Union. It was conceived during a consultative workshop that held in April 2017 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Shelika in her welcome address noted that the event was long overdue but had been postponed twice due to the pandemic. She said, “Our mission is to produce skilled and financially empowered women involved in fish and seafood processing through training, for standardisation of products in order to meet requirements of African and international markets for information sharing, across African women.” The keynote speaker, Mrs Stella Oraka, spoke on the prospects and challenges of women in fish export.
