Delta and Edo states are set to battle Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Rivers and Abuja for the right to host the Super Eagles in their opening 2022 World Cup qualifying match against Liberia next month, The PUNCH reports. The Confederation of African Football on Tuesday approved seven stadiums in the country to host the Eagles’ qualifying home games for Qatar 2022, with the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba and the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, amongst the approved venues. The others are Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja; Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu; Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos; Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo and the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt. The Eagles have played their recent games in Asaba, Benin City and Lagos, but Delta and Edo states say they will love to see the country’s men’s national football team return to their states for the World Cup qualifying games. Delta State Sports Commission chairman Tonobok Okowa said, “Why not? We are hoping to host the Eagles. We will discuss with the Nigeria Football Federation and look into it. We don’t have anything against the Eagles, and it will be our pleasure to host them,” Okowa told The PUNCH. Chief Press Secretary to the Edo State Deputy Governor Ebomhiana Musa said Edo would not be left out of the race to host the Eagles. “As a state, we have what it takes to host the Eagles, we have the facilities. Politics aside, Edo State has all it takes to camp the Eagles,” Musa told The PUNCH. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
