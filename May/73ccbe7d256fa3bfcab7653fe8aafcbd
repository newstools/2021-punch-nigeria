The National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Kola Ologbondiyan, has stated that the PDP will not succumb to blackmail and intimidation, following the invitation from the Economic Financial Crimes Commission to explain how N10bn was allegedly diverted. The EFCC is reported to have invited senior officials of the PDP following an allegation leveled against the PDP leadership by Kassim Afegbua, a chieftain of the party, concerning transactions related to party affairs. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the PDP National Youths Frontier slammed the EFCC for inviting the party’s officials, stating that only the Independent National Electoral Commission has the legal right to probe a political party’s finances. The PDP has, however, stated their position in their statement on Wednesday, signed by the publicity secretary. The party stated that it will not succumb to any form of blackmail and political intimidation but will “continue in its role of providing constructive opposition as well as being the national platform for all Nigerians in their rally to rescue and secure our nation from the misrule of the All Progressives Congress.” Describing the party as a “responsible and public-spirited political party”, the PDP announced that they have honoured the invitation extended to the party officials by the commission. The statement revealed that the party is not deterred by EFCC’s invitation as it maintains that the PDP did not “raise the sum of N10 billion being frivolously bandied in some quarters as proceeds from the sale of nomination forms.” The party also urged its members, supporters across the nation, and members of the public to remain calm in light of the present situation.
