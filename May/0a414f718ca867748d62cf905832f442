The family of the late governor of the old Western Region, Sir Odeleye Fadahunsi, has lamented the refusal of the federal and Osun State governments to immortalise their patriarch since his death on May 11, 1986. A statement by one of the sons of the late governor, Mr Taiwo Fadahunsi, on Tuesday said the refusal was a disservice to the “nationalistic efforts of the late politician” who the family described as one of Nigeria’s founding fathers. The statement was issued as part of activities marking the 38th anniversary of the demise of the late nationalist. Fadahunsi who was elected a member of the defunct Western Region on the platform of the National Council For Nigerian Citizens took office as the governor of the region with the exit of the former holder, Sir Adesoji Aderemi, the then Ooni of Ife in 1962. He vacated office in January 1966 upon the takeover of government by the military. Taiwo said the family had written a series of letters both to the state and federal governments, “without acknowledgement.” The statement added, “Today marks the 38th anniversary of the demise of our father, Sir Odeleye Fadahunsi. Since he died in 1986, there has not been any effort to immortalise his memory by Oyo (now Osun) State. The Federal Government too has not done anything to immortalise him. “We wish to state that other nationalists of the stature of our patriarch have been honoured with one monument or institution without any thought to Sir Odeleye. “In as much as we are sad by this development, we hope the occasion of his 38th anniversary will force the hands of both governments to do what is right.”
