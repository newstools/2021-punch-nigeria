While rounding up from the church, one of the brothers who was trying to park a car met some boys outside. “He said the boys pushed him out of the car which he thought they wanted to collect from him. They slapped him when they discovered he was not the persons they were looking for. Then they brought him into the church and started searching for who they were looking for. They saw my husband and said he was the person. ‘When we got outside, they started shooting and pushed my husband into their car. We drove after them towards Irese road but they were shooting at us. It was dark so we stopped. Since then we have not heard anything from them (kidnappers). “May God helped me to bring my husband back. He is the only son of his parents. Nigerians should help secure the release of my husband.” The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Bolaji Salami said he had directed his men to secure the release of the pastor unhurt.
