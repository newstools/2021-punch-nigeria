The Lagos State Government has said it will enhance the greenery of the state through its environmental renewal. It added that it would identify degraded, vacant and contaminated spaces and transform such into parks and gardens. According to a statement on Sunday, the General Manager, Lagos State Park and Gardens Agency, Mrs Adetoun Popoola, said  this at the Johnson Jakande Tinubu Park in Alausa, Ikeja. Popoola said, “In the last two years of this administration, LASPARK, as the custodian of public open spaces in Lagos, has strategically aligned its efforts and plans in bringing into its fold more green partners to support and advance the greening evolution.” Popoola said the current administration in alliance with the private sector was working towards the regeneration of Lagos through various programmes to promote clean green environment by building and sustaining urban green spaces like parks, gardens, and roadsides vegetation across the state. “This alliance is key to the state government’s stride in creating a more sustainable city through public-private partnership. The agency has also been able to engage non-governmental actors and green investors to utilise, develop and identify empty open spaces,” she added. She stated that LASPARK had planted over seven million trees across the state in addition to the establishment of 11 public events park and 297 gardens in its efforts to deliver a clean, eco-friendly and sustainable city.
