The Middle Belt Forum has described as sad the threat by bandits to kill the students they abducted from Greenfield University, Kaduna. The bandits who have already killed five of them said they will kill the remaining students in their custody if a  ransom of N100m is not paid on or before Tuesday (today). Reacting, the National Publicity Secretary of the MBF, Dr Isuwa Dogo, who spoke to one of our correspondents in Jos on Monday, condemned the development. He said it was unfortunate that some people had chosen to take the law into their own hands under the guise of banditry while the government whose responsibility is to protect the citizens from such devilish acts watched helplessly without doing anything. He stated, “I don’t believe that the government and the security agents do not know where the bandits are hiding with the abducted students. “In this era of information technology, they can easily use the necessary gadgets to track down the criminals who are issuing the threats to kill the kidnapped students but government has not done that for whatever reason. “So, it is left for them to rescue the kidnapped students or allow the bandits to kill them. “The choice is left for the government, but I don’t think that if  the abducted children were to be the President’s sons or daughters, or  the Senate president’s children, they would have allowed them ( bandits) to kill the students  without doing everything possible to free them from the hands of their captors.”
