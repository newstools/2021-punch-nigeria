Nigeria’s hammer thrower Annette Echikunwoke has qualified for this summer’s Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Saturday PUNCH reports. The 25-year-old, who became eligible to represent Nigeria in January, set a personal record of 73.93m at the Tucson Elite Classic in Arizona where she finished second in the early hours of Friday to become the 11th Nigerian athlete to qualify for the Olympic Games. Blessing Okagbare, Divine Oduduru, Ese Brume, Tobi Amusan, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, Raymond Ekwevo, Favour Ofili, Ruth Osoro, Grace Nwokocha and Usheoritse Itsekiri are the other athletes who have qualified for the world’s biggest sporting event. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to hold from July 23 to August 8. Echikunwoke had set an African record of 72.25m a fortnight ago but it was just 25m shy of the 72.50m Olympic standard. She is also the current National Record and African Record holder in the women’s Hammer throw. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
