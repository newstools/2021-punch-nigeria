Thomas Tuchel is set for a new contract through at least 2023 after helping Chelsea to a 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Champions League final. The Blues became European champions for the second time thanks to a Kai Havertz strike, and have quickly secured the future of the manager who masterminded the success. After replacing Frank Lampard in January, Chelsea signed Tuchel to an 18-month deal that has now been extended. Tuchel hinted at his impending extension at his post-match press conference on Saturday. “I’m not even 100 per cent sure, but maybe I have a new contract now,” Tuchel said. “It can be, my manager said something about it, but I do not know. So let’s check this first. “I spoke to the owner right now on the pitch, this was the best moment for a first meeting. We will speak tomorrow, speak later, speak tomorrow, and looking forward to this.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
