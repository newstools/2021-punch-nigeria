The Osile of Oke-Ona Egba, Oba Adewale Tejuosho, on Sunday said he facilitated the emergence of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999. He explained that Obasanjo was a replacement for the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola. Recall that the election was annulled by the Military government led by the Gen. Ibrahim Babanjida (retd.). The first class monarch said God used him to have an agreement with other regions  during the 1994 constitution conference that a Yoruba man would become the next president of the country to assuage the region. Oba Tejuosho spoke during a press briefing in his residence in commemoration of his 32nd coronation anniversary scheduled to begin on Monday. He explained that it was during the 1994 constitution conference that agreement was made for rotation of the presidency. The monarch noted that although the report of the conference was thrown out by the late Maj. Gen. Sani Abacha, the agreement of shifting the presidency to the Yoruba was sealed. He added, “It was the agreement that made Obasanjo became the preferred candidate for the 1999 election.” Oba Tejuosho stressed that God intentionally sent him to the conference so as to protect the interest of the Yoruba race. “Even though the 1994 constitution was thrown by the Abacha’s regime, it was at that conference that we said okay, if we are not going to give this presidency to MKO Abiola, make sure it goes to a Yoruba man and not other person. “They remembered our agreement and they went to fetch Obasanjo in the prison to become the president of the nation. “So, that was the purpose that God wanted me to be at the conference; to fight for Yoruba.” Copyright PUNCH.
