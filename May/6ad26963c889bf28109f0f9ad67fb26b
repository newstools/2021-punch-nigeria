The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo town, Ondo State, Prof. Adesegun Fatusi, has stated that the newly established molecular biology laboratory in the state will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19, Lassa fever and several other deadly infections. It was  gathered that the laboratory was established from the money realised by the COVID-19 Support Fund Committee of the state government. The don, who spoke at the inauguration of the laboratory located on the premises of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Ondo, said the lab was a key facility in the varsity’s vision to utilise “molecular biosciences to drive health research and training as well as boost quality health care delivery.” The inauguration of the new laboratory was done by the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu. Adesegun said, “These facilities will also drive the use of molecular genomic techniques to better understand and address the challenges of diseases like cancer and diabetes as well as diagnose genetic disorders and provide DNA paternity testing.” In his remarks, Akeredolu expressed his delight over the fight against the spread of the deadly coronavirus disease in the state as he said  there was no COVID-19 patient in isolation centers in the state. He also disclosed that the committee set up by the government to raise funds for the COVID-19 campaign realised a sum of N800m for the fight against the spread of the pandemic in the state. “Even though, the rate of spread of COVID-19 infection in the country is reducing, that has not in any way diminished the need for a molecular biology laboratory as Lassa Fever is still prevalent in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
