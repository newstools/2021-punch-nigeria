The national flag and other flags at the Presidential Villa in Abuja are currently flying at half-mast in line with a directive issued by the President, Major General Muhamamdu Buhari (retd.). Buhari gave the directive in honour of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 others who died in an air crash on Friday. The directive was announced on Sunday by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who revealed that the gesture would last for three days. Personal Assistant to the President on Broadcast Media, Buhari Sallau, shared photos from the Presidential Villa to show compliance with the directive. “Flags flying at half-mast at the State House, Abuja, in honour of the departed Chief of Army Staff and other military officers, who died in a plane crash on Friday, May 21, 2021,” he captioned the photos.
