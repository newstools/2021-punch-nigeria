Nigerian athletes have expressed delight at Lagos winning the rights to host the African Senior Athletics Championships. The PUNCH reported on Wednesday that the championships will return to Lagos 32 years after the former Nigerian capital last hosted it. Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, in a meeting with President of the Confederation of African Athletics in Cairo, agreed to host the event at the Teslim Balogun Stadium and Yaba College of Technology. Speaking with our correspondent on Wednesday, athlete Orukpe Erayokan said it was an opportunity for Nigerian athletes to qualify for the Olympics “It is a very good development and I like that it is holding in Lagos. This is another opportunity to run a good qualification time for the Olympics,” he told The PUNCH. Another athlete, Afeez Abdullahi, said, “I believe this will give us the opportunity to compete with the best in Africa and to set a standard to qualify for the Olympics. Compeiting with the best in Africa is one thing that will motivate many athletes to run PBs.” Hope Ngabi asked the local authorities to use the opportunity to invest more in athletes. “It is a welcome development, I am so excited that after we hosted this competition in Asaba in 2018, we are hosting again, it is a plus for our athletes. “I beg our administrators to give us the desired support so we can give our best at the competition. Our athletes aren’t getting the kind of support we need,” Ngabi said. Africa’s flagship athletics event, which was billed to hold in Oran, Algeria between June 22 and 26, after it was moved forward from last year, was postponed by the Algerian government due to COVID-19 concerns.
