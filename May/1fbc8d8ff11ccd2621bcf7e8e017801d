He said, “We are disappointed that this present administration under Governor Ifeanyi Ugwanyi has yet to establish a campus of ESUT in Nsukka zone since the SEC approved its return to the original multi-campus structure. “This approval and the law backing it entail the relocation of the university’s faculties of Medical Science, Social Science and Agriculture to the zone. There is urgent need to have this compus being fully developed in Nsukka zone by now.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
