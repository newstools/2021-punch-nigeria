wo people were feared killed in Ikire, Osun State, on Thursday as members of Oodua Peoples Congress and Oodua Peoples Congress Initiative clashed. Sources in Ikire told our correspondent that the crisis started in the town on Tuesday when a member of OPCI allegedly shot dead a member of OPC. The Osun OPC coordinator, Deji Aladesawe, told our correspondent that a member of OPC, called Olayode, was shot dead, despite the intervention of the Akire-in-Council, who had earlier brokered peace between the two rival groups. Asked if the deceased member of OPCI was killed by OPC men in retaliation, Aladesawe, who denied involvement of his men in the death of the rival group member, identified as Wasiu, said the security situation in the town was under control. He said, “The suspect involved in the killing of OPC member called him out from his place of work and shot him dead. The name of our member that was killed is Olayode. A member of OPCI was also killed in the clashes that followed the first killing. His name is Wasiu. “Police should investigate and apprehend all trouble makers.” The Special Adviser to the Osun State Governor on Security, Abiodun Ige, told our correspondent that the police were working to ensure peace. The state police command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed that there was an unrest in the town. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
