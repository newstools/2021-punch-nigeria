Enyimba will hope to overcome a three-goal deficit when they face Egyptian side Pyramids FC in the second leg of their quarter-final CAF Confederation Cup clash on Sunday (today) in Aba. Both teams meet at the Enyimba Stadium, Aba after Pyramids posted an emphatic 4-1 victory in Cairo last Sunday. Speaking ahead of the fixture, Enyimba midfielder Anayo Iwuala, who missed the first leg due to suspension, said the People’s Elephant are united and believe they can score three unreplied goals to advance to the semi-final stage. “We just have to put our heads together and work as a team with one mind. It’s football and I believe anything is possible, we have to get the three goals. It’s possible, we can, I believe that come Sunday, we will be able to get the three goals,” the Super Eagles forward told Enyimba’s website. Iwuala also bemoaned missing the first leg. “Missing the first leg was not a good feeling, although I still had belief in my team because I know with or without me, something positive can come out of the Enyimba team. But naturally, I was not feeling good, because I had one or two things to give to the team,” he added. Enyimba will hope to better last year’s record, where they lost 3-1 on aggregate to Guinean side, Horoya, at the same stage of the competition. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
