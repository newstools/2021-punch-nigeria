Former presidential candidate of the People’s Trust in the 2019 elections, Mr Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, on Wednesday said Nigerians must be ready to contribute to the peace that he said the country needed now more than ever before. Olawepo-Hashim said this in his Eid-el-Fitr message titled ‘Olawepo-Hashim felicitates with Muslims at Sallah.’ “We need peace more than ever before. “This period should be for the cleansing of our inner souls and collective prayer for the good and well being of our country,” he said. The politician noted that the Ramadan period, which has been of intense worship to God, should be a time to reflect and abide by the teachings of Prophet Muhammad in extending love, acts of unity and compassion to mankind. While calling on Muslims to continue to pray for the peace and stability of Nigeria especially now that the country is faced with numerous challenges, Olawepo-Hashim enjoined them and other Nigerians to use the Sallah period for the renewal of faith for a strong and united Nigeria. He added, “No doubt the Ramadan period was characterised by an intensely spiritual exercise that bought the Muslims closer to Almighty Allah. “On this special day, we celebrate with the Muslim Ummah and pray Almighty Allah will accept the acts of worship and restore ultimate peace and harmony in all parts of the country.” He said the Ramadan period and the Sallah festivities that followed, should be a period of total submission to the will of God and therefore, admonished citizens to be moderate and law-abiding in their conduct in accordance with the teachings of the Prophet so as to have a hitch-free celebration.
