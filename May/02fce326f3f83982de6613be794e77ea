The House of Representatives’ Committee on Local Content on Tuesday began the investigation of alleged abuse of bidding, contracting and operating processes by Exxon Mobil against Nigerian-owned companies. The probe is being carried out by the House Committee on Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring led by Legor Idagbo. At the maiden investigative hearing of the committee, the Chairman, Legor Idagbo, stated that the exercise was not to witch-hunt the International Oil Company. Idagbo said, “This investigative hearing is not a witch-hunt in any way. “We are all Nigerians and what is to the best interest of our country and our citizens should be paramount in our minds. “There is no way our indigenes would complain to us and we fold our hands and not do something about it.” The Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer, Exxon Mobil, Segun Banwo, who represented the Managing Director, dismissed the allegations. After taking submissions from the stakeholders, the committee adjourned for two weeks, while directing ExxonMobil to provide documents to back their counter claims at the next sitting. The committee also demanded that the company’s managing director should appear in person. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
