The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, has said the Lagos State Government plans to regenerate Otto and Otumara slum communities in the mainland axis of the state. A statement by the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Mukaila Sanusi, said this on Tuesday. According to the commissioner, the move, which is in line with the THEMES Agenda, will culminate in the creation of a new micro city with better urban aesthetics and vibrancy in Otto and Otumara. He said that the creation of a micro city in those locations would complement the proposed revamping of the National Arts Theatre by the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria-led Committee of Bankers. Salako stated that the micro city would be delivered with the upgrade of existing socio-economic amenities like hospitals/clinics, schools, market, water among others, which would be upgraded in-situ. He added that there would be preservation and conservation of ecologically sensitive land spaces such as buffer zones, earth drain, floodplains and waterfronts as well as the creation of new viable economic activity centers, including residential-led mixed use.
