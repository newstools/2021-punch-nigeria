He added, “They will increase local production, create job opportunities and improve our foreign exchange reserve position. “It is, therefore, my pleasure to commission this manufacturing plant which will contribute significantly to the areas I just mentioned. “I believe this will help in taking us steps ahead in our effort to diversify the economy and increase the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the GDP. “Most especially, the plant will provide jobs to Nigeria’s workforce. It will also promote local content and save the nation the extra cost of importing the now locally produced input.”
