THE Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has said that bringing the former Petroleum Minister, Diezani Alison Madueke, to justice was still far from reality. He said the fact that ex-minister was out of Nigeria’s jurisdiction and the challenges associated with bringing her home to face justice remained an obstacle towards ensuring she faced justice. This was contained in the April edition of the EFCC magazine, EFCC Alert. He disclosed that the commission had recovered $153m from the former minister who had been living in Britain since leaving office in 2015. Bawa also said the anti-graft agency recovered no fewer than 80 choice property valued at $80m. The chairman said, “There are several cases surrounding Diezani’s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153m; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 property in Nigeria valued at about $80m. We have done quite a bit on that. “The other case as it relates to the $115m INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country, and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
