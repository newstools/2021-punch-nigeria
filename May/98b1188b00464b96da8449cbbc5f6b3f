A businessman based in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, Linus Owuamanam, has been shot dead by some yet-to-be-identified gunmen. Our correspondent gathered on Sunday that Onwuamana was shot dead by the hoodlums around 8pm on Saturday. The businessman was said to be driving a bus when the incident reportedly happened along the Mokola-Sango Road in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. After shooting Owuamanam, his assailants were said to have also stabbed him on the left side of his chest to make sure he did not survive the gruesome attack. However, he was said to be breathing when he was rushed to the hospital for treatment. As of the time of filing this report, nobody knew the whereabouts of the second person said to be on the bus with the victim when the incident happened. A passerby, who saw the victim in the pool of his own blood, was said to have alerted the victim’s workers. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Mr Adewale Osifeso, when contacted confirmed the killing to our correspondent on the telephone. He said, “Investigations are in top gear to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the incident and to also apprehend the perpetrators of the dastardly act.”
