ADAMU Atiku, son of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in 2019 general elections, has said N100bn bond being sought by the administration of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, is intended to transform the livestock subsector and boost the state’s internally generated revenues from Agro-business. Atiku, who is the Commissioner of Works and Energy Development for Adamawa State, made this known on Sunday while debunking claims that the N100bn bond facility the state government had secured from the capital market was intended for the 2023 elections and completion of massive infrastructural projects, undertaken by the administration of Fintiri. He explained that state secured N17bn loan from a commercial bank to complete all infrastructural projects executed under the urban renewal project that included the first flyover in the North-East and over 50km of township roads, adding that the repayment of the loan, which was tied to its internally generated revenues was separate from the N100bn bond. He explained that the bond facility would purely be utilised in organising livestock business under the Adamawa Agribusiness Support, as the state expected to collect N25bn annually in four tranches for the programme. The commissioner said, “Livestock alone in Adamawa State contributes almost 50 per cent of our GDP. So, there is huge potential in there and we want to take advantage of this. Lagos for example rakes in over N100bn from just slaughtering cattle and livestock got from here. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
