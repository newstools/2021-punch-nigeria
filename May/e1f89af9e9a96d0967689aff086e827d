The Katsina Command of the Nigerian Immigration Service early Friday rescued 10 victims of human trafficking. The victims are Austin Naney, Otto happiness, EyintuOluwa Adelola, Adams Zainab, Jamilu Zainab, Ogunnwa Yetunde, Andrew Ozugbo, Okafor Blessing, Azizat Adamu, and Adesola Eyinzuola. The NIS Comtrproller for Katsina, Abdurrazaq Muaazu, confirmed the development to newsmen on Friday. He said the 10 victims who were from Lagos, Delta, and Edo, were picked up at Babban Mutum axis of the border post. Muaazu believed that the victims must have been misled by the human traffickers. According to him, the victims would be handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons “for further investigation, counselling, training, rehabilitation and prosecution as the case may be.” The NIS boss warned human traffickers to stay away from Katsina, declaring that officers and men of the command were battle-ready to combat human trafficking. He warned, “The command is prepared to burst the syndicate groups operating within our area of jurisdiction.”
