THE Ajia Balogun Olubadan of Ibadanland, Chief Adegboyega Adegoke, had advocated the convocation of a national dialogue to discuss various pro-secession agitations and insecurity across the country. Adegoke in a statement by his media aide, Raji Adebayo, on Tuesday advised those agitating for restructuring or secession to first allow a dialogue on the current insecurity threatening the country. The APC chieftain said the outcome of the national dialogue would determine the next line of action for the country to move forward. He said, “There is the need for a national dialogue where everybody will come together and say his or her mind. “I know that we had one during the time of former President, Goodluck Jonathan, but where is the report? The book is gathering dust. To me, I will tell you that there are a lot of benefits if we are together.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
