The Primate of the First African Church Mission, His Eminence, Most Rev. S.O. Matiluko, has tasked the Federal Government provide employment for the country’s teeming youth population. Matiluko stated this on Sunday during the investiture of 13 sacred Knights of the Primatial Order at Jehovah Shalom Cathedral, Tinubu, Lagos. A statement on Sunday quoted him as saying, “After God, it is the government. Let our government live up to expectation. They can do this by providing reasonable employment for our youths and satisfying the yearnings of the masses throughout the nation. An idle hand is the devil’s workshop.” At the event, candidates for the knighthood, following their presentation and examination by the bishop, swore their allegiance to God. Matiluko urged the new Knights to embrace holiness. “Anything unholy must be found with you. You are now a peculiar people; a unique people. You have agreed to be soldiers of Christ. You cannot do what ordinary people are doing,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
