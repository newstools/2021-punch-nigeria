Public Relations and Communications Association, the world’s largest community of public relations professionals, has profiled three promising Nigerian businesses as part of its small business heroes campaign launched in April 2021. The businesses which cut across fashion, technology, new media and law are 618 Bees, a legal tech company, Gbemisoke shoes, a women’s shoe line, and Emblue, a media and communication company, leveraging technology to drive consumer attention. PRCA PR and Communications Council had launched the Small Business Heroes campaign to support SMEs at all levels as they navigate the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic while demonstrating the positive impact PR can have on businesses when applied effectively. The case studies featured businesses that have demonstrated rapid growth while applying creative PR strategies to address key challenges faced by their target market. Speaking on the inclusion of the businesses, PRCA council member and Founder/CEO of Blackhouse Media, Ayeni Adekunle, said, “Considering that in Nigeria, SMEs account for 96 per cent of total businesses, 84 per cent of employment and contribute 48 per cent of the country’s GDP, there is an opportunity for us to support the wider Nigerian economy by focusing on SMEs.” He added that many entrepreneurs had demonstrated resilience by adapting and in many cases pivoting their businesses in response to the challenges posed by the pandemic.
