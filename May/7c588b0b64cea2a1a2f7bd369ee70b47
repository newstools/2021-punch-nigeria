More deaths have been recorded in attacks by suspected herdsmen on some communities in the Bali Local Government Area of Taraba State. While six people were reportedly killed on Thursday, a local, Suega Anshiva, told our correspondent on the phone that two people were killed along the Yelwa-Jatau Road in an ambush while fleeing the attacks. Another resident, Joy Agbe, said three people were killed in Borno Kurku on the border between Bali and Donga local government areas. Our correspondent gathered that several houses were burnt while hundreds of people have fled their homes since the attacks started on Thursday. The displaced were said to be taking refuge in makeshift camps in Bali, headquarters of Bali Local Government Area. The leader of Tiv in Bali, Zaki Gbaa, said over 4,000 people were currently taking refuge at the Tiv Traditional Council Hall, NKST-Universal Reformed Christian Church, the Legislative Hall, and other locations in the town. Gbaa said, “The population of the internally displaced persons is overwhelming and there is no more space to accommodate them. “Many of them are being beaten by rain anytime rain falls because of the nature of the camps. I worry for the children and pregnant women that we have here. There is no food to even go round. The situation is so pathetic.” Gbaa appealed to the government and individuals to come to the IDPs’ aid. When contacted, Taraba State Police Command spokesman, ASP David Misal, said three people were killed in the attack on villages around Gazabu and Utsua Daa. He added that some people were said to be missing, but said relative peace had been restored in the area. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
