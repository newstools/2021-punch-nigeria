The National Association of Resident Doctors says it has decided to delay its intended strike as a goodwill gesture to the Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who has been making efforts to address its demands. In a statement jointly signed by the President, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi; Secretary-General, Jerry Isogun; and Social secretary, Dotun Oshikoya, of the association, the group commended the Speaker for his interest in the group and decided to delay its strike for three weeks. “Finally the NEC having considered all the facts made available delayed any action on the suspended industrial action till the ordinary general meeting which is to hold in three weeks’ time in Awka, Anambra state as a goodwill gesture to Mr Speaker who mediated between the association and the Federal Government as well as for the government to complete her part of the agreement,” the statement read. According to NARD, the Speaker deserves a special commendation for the uncommon interest he has shown to matters affecting the association and for the promotion of healthcare delivery in the country hence the need to honour him by delaying the intended strike. According to the statement, the Speaker visited the association’s national secretariat on April 13 and promised that demands would be met. The statement further stated that the Speaker on April 29 summoned a meeting where Federal Government officials and heads of medical facilities were present. Recall that resident doctors had embarked on an indefinite strike on April 1, 2021 due to the government’s inability to address issues raised by the association but later called it off. The association was billed to embark on a fresh strike on May 7 but it shelved the idea due to Gbajabiamila’s intervention.
