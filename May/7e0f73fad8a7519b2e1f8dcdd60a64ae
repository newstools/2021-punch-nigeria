THE Federal Government said on Thursday that it would soon revive the Special Terrorism Prosecution Courts. The Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr Umar Gwandu. Malami, in the statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria, said the move was geared towards the Federal Government’s commitment towards ending insecurity in the country. “The Federal Government is committed to ending insecurity in the country. The courts are to bring to book all those found guilty in connection with terrorism so as to serve as deterrence to others. “In addition to the prosecution of 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers, the measures taken by the government will counter the twin trouble of insurgency and insecurity in the country,” the statement read. Malami also, while felicitating with Muslim faithful all over the world on the occasion of the year’s Eid-el-Fitr, noted that Ramadan fast comes with numerous lessons. “The lessons include sincerity, honesty, commitment, sacrifice, selflessness, introspection and empathy, among others,” the minister added. He, therefore, urged Muslims as they celebrate to continue to be law-abiding, have sober reflections and exhibit the lessons learnt during the period of Ramadan fast. Copyright PUNCH.
