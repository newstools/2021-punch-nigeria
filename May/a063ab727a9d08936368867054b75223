THE Ondo State Security Network Agency Amotekun has arrested about 137 persons who were from the northern part of the country for illegally occupying the state forest reserves in the state. The development came barely 48 hours after 45 youths from the northern part of the country, who were arrested in front of the army barracks in Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state, were sent back to their respective states on Sunday on the order of the state government. Speaking on the matter on Tuesday in Akure the state capital, the state Commander of Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, disclosed that the illegal forest occupants would be escorted out of Ondo State to where they came from. He said, “We moved in on questioning majority of them; they said they were from the northern part of the country and others said they are from Ogun State.” “We profiled them and we found out that they were conniving with some persons in Ose (council area) to be given space for settlement in the government’s forest reserve which makes them illegal occupants of the forests. We are sending them back to where they claimed they came from.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
