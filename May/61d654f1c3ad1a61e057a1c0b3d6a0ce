The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the President, Major Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to guarantee the security of children as Nigeria celebrates Children’s Day. PDP made this call in a statement released on Thursday titled, ‘Stop mortgaging the future of Nigerian children, PDP tells Buhari, APC’. In the statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP urged the President to guarantee the safety of children by taking steps to end insecurity in the country. “Our party urges President Buhari to end his administration’s insensitivity to the children by deploying special incentives to boost access to education, healthcare as well as guarantee the security and safety of children especially in crisis areas. “President Buhari must take steps to end the insecurity in the country so that the children in IDP camps and crisis ridden areas can return to their normal lives,” the statement partly read. The PDP also called on the National Assembly, state legislative houses, and Nigerians at large to collectively work towards the safety of children. “The PDP also urges the National Assembly as well as state legislative houses to strengthen all child rights and protection legislations and ensure effective implementation in the interest of the children. “As a party, the PDP believes in the Nigerian child and calls on well-meaning and public-spirited Nigerians to use the day to reach out and intervene in the myriads of challenges facing the Nigerian children.”
