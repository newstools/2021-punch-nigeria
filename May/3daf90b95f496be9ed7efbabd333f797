Hoodlums have razed the Igboeze South Local Government Area office of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Enugu State. This came barely a week after the INEC State Headquarters was attacked and vehicles and other valuables torched. The PUNCH gathered the hoodlums arrived at the INEC office located in Ibeagwa Aka at about 10.45pm Sunday night and set the office on fire. Community sources told our correspondent on Monday that the Hoodlums succeeded in burning one of the rooms in the office before the arrival of the State Fire Service who battled to put the fire off. The PUNCH reports that the Igboeze South attack has brought to three the number of INEC offices in Enugu State that have been set ablaze by arsonists in two weeks. The Enugu State Chief Fire Officer, Okwudili Ohaa, who confirmed the attack to our correspondent said the situation had been brought under control. He said, “There was a fire outbreak at INEC Office, Ibagwa in Igbo-Eze South Local Government Area late Sunday night. We responded promptly, the situation is under control and we have extinguished the fire. “It was only one room that was affected by the fire.” Efforts to get the reaction of the Enugu INEC headquarters were unsuccessful as the spokesman, Mr. Pius Ezeh, did not answer the calls made to his phone.
