Goals from Abba Maigari and Ahmed Jimoh were enough to give Gombe United a 2-0 win over unbeaten El-Kanemi in their Week 13 2020/21 Nigeria National League fixture played at the Pantami Stadium, Gombe. It was El-Kanemi’s first defeat in 13 matches this season. It took 33 minutes before Gombe United broke the jinx, with Maigari capitalising on a goalmouth after a Sani Shehu corner kick to simply slot home from close range. The impressive Jimoh them headed home the second goal in the 38th minute to seal the win. The visitors had the chance to reduce the deficit after Shehu handled the ball inside the box in the 62nd minute but Bala Zaka’s resultant penalty was superbly saved by Itodo Akor, in goal for Gombe United. Gombe United manager Aliyu Zubairu said, “It was a tense match as the two teams have been leading the Group A1 log since the kick-off of the league, but I told my boys to be calm and eventually we got the three points.” Copyright PUNCH.
