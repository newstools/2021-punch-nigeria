The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has announced that candidates are expected to pay N700 to the Computer Based Test centres before taking their mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. JAMB made the announcement three days before the commencement of the mock examination via its Twitter handle. The payment is different from the N3,500 paid by the candidates for UTME forms (ePINs), and N500 for the reading text. It was also learnt this is different from the N700 expected to be paid to the CBT centres for the examination. “All candidates sitting the 2021 Mock examination scheduled for Thursday, 3rd June 2021 are advised to go to their assigned centres with N700. The amount would be paid to the Centre owner as the mock examination fee,” the examination body said.  Earlier, JAMB asked candidates, who had indicated interests to sit for the mock-UTME and had earlier printed the examination slips, were advised to reprint, following the shift in examination date. “Candidates, who had registered for the 2021 UTME and indicated interest to sit for the optional mock examination, are to reprint their mock notification slips. “This is consequent on the change of date for the mock- UTME earlier scheduled for Thursday, May 20 and now to hold on Thursday, June 3. “It is imperative to reprint as the new slip will have a new date. “As disclosed earlier, the optional mock notification slip can be printed from anywhere that candidates find convenient, provided they have internet access.” The board explained that each slip contained candidates’ details such as registration number and most importantly, the centre they were to sit for the examination within their chosen examination town. It added that the slip also contained the expected time to be at the centre. Candidates, JAMB further advised, were expected to print and study the contents in the slip to avoid mix up in the location of their centres and the name of the examination centres.
