Following a poor season, where they finished 11th, Hodo Williams, captain of Nigeria Women’s Football League side, Pelican Stars, says they hope to perform better in the play-offs to ensure they remain in the topflight league for next season. The 2020/21 NWFL play-offs is scheduled for the University of Benin Sports Complex, Benin City from May 7 to 11. Former champions Pelican Stars, Abia Angels, Ibom Angels and DreamStar Ladies are the last four teams in the league and will participate in the play-offs, which will determine the two teams to be relegated. Speaking with Saturday PUNCH, Hodo said she was confident that her Calabar-based side would stay up and fight for the league next season. “Our target is to ensure that Pelican Stars stay in the topflight, and we’ve been training hard to achieve that,” she said. “We are doing our best in putting all our efforts in training. We believe that when we come back, it will be with the desired result, which is to ensure we don’t get relegated. “As the captain of the team, I’ve been talking to my teammates and trying to charge them up to ensure we don’t go down. We need to stay in the league and do better next season because it really hurts that as former champions we are struggling to stay up, rather than trying to win the league again. We all know what our challenge is and that has been the finances, but we are confident that we can bounce back and I’m sure we will do that.” The play-offs would be played on a round-robin basis, with the top two teams retaining their places in the NWFL Premiership, while the bottom two teams would be relegated.
