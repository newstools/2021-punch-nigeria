The Lagos State Government on Wednesday said the government had created the Graduate Internship Payment Programme to tackle unemployment in the state. The Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs Yetunde Arobieke, stated this in Alausa, Ikeja, during her ministry’s press briefing to commemorate the second year anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, adding that the government was targeting 4,000 interns. She said, “We are going to run the programme for six months. The Federal Government will give the interns N30,000 each, while Lagos State will give N40,000 each. Corporate organisations, parastatals and agencies will absorb them so that they will have the knowledge of the workspace. “It is planned to expose interns to a particular job, profession or industry, giving them the opportunity to excel and exposing them to professional skills and interpersonal relationships in a structured setting, as well as  exposing interns to a niche for entrepreneurial opportunities.” She added that the state has revitalised about 10,000 businesses adversely affected by the #EndSARS protest with N939.98m, adding that about 40,020 indirect jobs were saved in the aftermath of the protest in the state. On capacity enhancement and up-skilling for tradesmen and artisans, Arobieke stated that 2,000 artisans selected from trade associations were retrained in 2020 while the retraining of another batch of 2,000 artisans will soon commence.
