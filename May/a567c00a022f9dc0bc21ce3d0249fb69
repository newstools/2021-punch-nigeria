Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State saus, the minimum amount of internally generated revenue required to run the state monthly is between N2.5billion to N3.5bn. To attain this threshold, Ikpeazu said there was the need for the government to be innovative, efficient, and proactive towards IGR growth cannot be overemphasised. He gave this charge when he met with members of the State IGR Council to express his concerns towards the economic downturn in the country as it affects the state’s economy, given that a significant drop in FAAC disbursements was expected in the coming months. A statement said he directed all MDAs and councils in the state to comply with Abia State Revenue laws and the Abia State Internal Revenue Service directives in order to achieve the much needed revenue for state development. “He commended all stakeholders for their efforts in growing and sustaining the state revenue from N500m to the current sum of N1.5bn monthly,  and gave stern matching orders to the Council as it concerns revenue collection administration in the state and directed that planned innovations that will lead to the realisation of the N3billion targeted monthly revenue must be implemented immediately,’ the statement added. The governor warned that any MDA hiding any revenue source will be severely sanctioned. He also mandated the State’s IRS to report all non-compliant MDAs by the end of May, including MDAs that refuse to accept an ABIRS desk officer at their ministries, emphasising that any personnel involved would be redeployed immediately.
