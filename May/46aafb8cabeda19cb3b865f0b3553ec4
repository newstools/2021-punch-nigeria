Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has assured Nigerians that the Federal Government is working to bring the labour crisis rocking Kaduna State to a peaceful end. He said this while answering questions from State House Correspondents after Wednesday’s Federal Executive Council meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Mohammed said that the Federal Government was disturbed about the sudden turn of events in Kaduna State, stressing that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, is already working to broker a truce between the opposing sides. He said, “The Federal Government is not folding its arms and already, the Minister of Labour and Employment has waded in and he is in touch with both the government of Kaduna State and the Labour. “In addition, the security apparatus all over the country have also taken pre-emptive measures to ensure that hoodlums don’t take advantage of this situation. “In particular, I know that the police have reinforced their patrol between Kaduna and Abuja so that we do not witness kidnappers taking advantage of the situation. “Overall, I think the Federal Government is quite concerned and is doing its best to see how the two parties can resolve their misunderstandings amicably, with little loss to productivity, little loss to properties. “At the end of the day, all the parties have to come back to the drawing table to agree and hammer out concessions and agreements”.
