The Federal Government on Sunday said reported cases of domestic and sexual violence tripled during the period of lockdown declared in Nigeria to curtail the spread of COVID-19. The Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, disclosed this in Abuja at a programme to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the World Union of Catholic Women. The programme with the theme ‘The role of women in eliminating gender violence,’ was organised by the Catholic Women Organisation of Nigeria. Tallen did not, however, disclose the figures of reported cases before and during the lockdown. She said, “Gender-Based Violence is reported to have significantly increased since the lockdown began in most affected areas of the country. “Domestic and sexual violence response team reported a three-fold increase in the number of telephone calls received through their hotlines.” She said the situation in Nigeria reflected the global trend of increased Gender-Based Violence. The minister warned against discrimination between both the male and the girl child in the country, saying “only equality would address many challenges in the country.” Tallen said the boy child should be treated as same as the girl child as they both have equal rights to life. The National President, CWON, Mary Gonsum, in her remarks said all hands must be on the deck to address Gender-Based Violence and banditry across the country, especially through prayer. She said as the country was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, homes were no longer safe.
