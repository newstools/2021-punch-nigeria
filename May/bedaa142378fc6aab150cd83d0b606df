The Lagos State Taskforce on Environmental and Special Offences Unit on Thursday evicted illegal occupants from the Iganmu underbridge. The unit said the state government would put the space to better use. Recall that a notice of eviction was issued to the occupants of the bridge on Monday with a three-day ultimatum. The Chairman of the task force, CSP Shola Jejeloye, said this in a statement by the unit’s Public Affairs Officer, Femi Moliki, on Thursday. Jejeloye stated that the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had visited the area in the company with the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and that it was agreed that the place should be put to good use as part of efforts to finding a lasting solution to the traffic jam in the Apapa area. Jejeloye, “Occupants of the Iganmu underbridge were informed to leave the area six months ago before they were eventually served a 72 -hour removal notice on Monday. Government agencies, including the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, Lagos Waste Management Agency, LASPARK and security agencies have been mandated to take possession of the area for cleaning up and management of the area.” The task force boss added that the move by the government would quell criminal activities in the area. “Clearing of the place and dislodgement of squatters will bring to an end the incessant traffic robberies, indiscriminate parking of trucks, environmental nuisance and selling of hard drugs in the area. The State Government will sustain this place. All those illegal activities; and this area serving as hideouts for criminals will no longer be allowed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
