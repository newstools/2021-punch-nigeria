The sacking of the 20 commissioners came just one month after the governor reshuffled his cabinet and appointed new Commissioners for Finance and Health. The sacking came as a surprise to the affected appointees, as there was no sign that the announcement would be made. The PUNCH gathered that the affected commissioners were in their offices on Wednesday afternoon when the news broke. The Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Nwachuku Oguwike, who confirmed the development to The PUNCH, said that the governor wished the affected appointee well in their future endeavours. The governor’s spokesperson said, “The news is correct. 20 commissioners were affected while eight were not affected. The reason is to infuse new blood and add more value to the governance system of the state.” The state Commissioner for information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, also confirmed the sacking of the 20 commissioners when contacted by The PUNCH on Wednesday afternoon. Imo State has been in the eye of the storm of late as members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra have been alleged to attack state security apparatus including prisons and police stations.
