The voice social network Clubhouse has said it will expand its Android app to Nigeria on Friday. This announcement was made on its Twitter account (@Clubhouse) on Sunday as Clubhouse shared its schedule for its Android app rollout. Based on the schedule, roll out to Japan, Brazil, and Russia will occur on Tuesday; Nigeria and India three days later, and the rest of the world by Friday afternoon. The tweet said, “Android rollout continues! Japan, Brazil & Russia coming Tuesday. Nigeria & India on Friday AM. Rest of world throughout the week, and available worldwide by Friday afternoon.” The Clubhouse app, which was originally available to IPhone users since last year, has been made available to Android users with the launch of a beta version of its app on Google-owned mobile operating system for United States users a few days ago. However, the Android app of Clubhouse does not have certain features present in the IPhone app. Some of the missing features include the ability to follow a topic,  create or manage a club, link social profiles, make payments, or change profile name of username. Nevertheless, the start-up said it was working to bring iOS features to the Android app. Backed by A16z, Tiger Global and DST Global, the start-up, which is valued at about $4bn, the app has gained popularity, attracting a number of high-profile celebrities, politicians, entrepreneurs and investors.
