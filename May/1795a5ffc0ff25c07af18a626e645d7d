NSIA Insurance has said it is committed to creating insurance awareness in the country. In a statement, titled ‘NSIA Insurance launches radio ad campaign’ on Tuesday, the company said it commenced the second quarter with the launch of its radio advertisement campaign, tagged ‘NSIA value campaign’. It said the campaign offered the opportunity to deliver a simple and powerful message to a targeted group of consumers in an effort to increase awareness about the organisation, and to communicate effectively the value of its product offerings and tailor-made services. According to the statement, the campaign has two directions, namely ‘Insurance is’ and ‘Insurance has a new look’. “Insurance is’ showcases insurance as a safety net, ensuring a person does not have to pay out-of-pocket when an eventuality occurs. ‘Insurance has a new look’ focuses on changing the perception about insurance in Nigeria,” it said. The statement said the directions spoke to the fact that NSIA Insurance was committed to providing its stakeholders with excellent customer experience, throughout their journey. NSIA said the campaign would run for five weeks on various radio stations in Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Warri, Abuja, Onitsha, Asaba, Enugu, Kaduna and Kano. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, NSIA Insurance, Ebelechukwu Nwachukwu, said, “We have a lot to offer to our customers in terms of value. We seek to help create, protect and preserve wealth.” She said one way the NSIA could fulfill this was by keeping its potential and existing customers in the loop about its new products and how they could benefit from them.
