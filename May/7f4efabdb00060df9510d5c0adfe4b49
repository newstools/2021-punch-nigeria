Striker Asisat Oshoala faces a late test to be fit for the Women’s Champions League Final on Sunday (today). Barcelona women’s side face Chelsea in the Champions League final at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden. The 26-year-old was included in the team of 23 players which arrived in Sweden for the final on Friday. Oshoala suffered an ankle injury, which made her miss their Copa de la Reina quarter-final victory over Sevilla and league game against Granadilla. The Super Falcons captain was involved in Barca’s run to the final, scoring in both legs of their quarter-final victory over Manchester City. Oshoala was part of the Barca side that lost 4-1 to French side Lyon in the Women’s Champions League final in Budapest in 2019. The four-time African Women’s Footballer of The Year will have to undergo a late fitness test to determine her availability for the final against the current English champions. Copyright PUNCH.
