SPEAKER of the Delta State House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, has called on governors of the South-South states to expedite action on the ban on open grazing in the region through executive bills to the various State Houses of Assembly for prompt legislative action. Oborevwori, who is the National Deputy Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, made the call on Tuesday while speaking on the African Independent Television Kakaaki programme. While commending the Southern Governors’ position on open grazing in the region, the Speaker described their action as “patriotic and timely intervention”, to restore peace and security to the region. He remarked that the State Houses of Assembly in the region will continue to throw their weight behind the governors’ ban on open grazing in the area. The Speaker, however, reiterated the urgent need for the governors to expedite action on their pronouncement by proposing a bill in that regard to their various Houses of Assembly in order to give the ban on open grazing some legal backing. He assured that as soon as the governors came up with the bill, the State Houses of Assembly will also expedite legislative action in order to ensure that the bill was passed into law. He said, “The decision of the South-South Governors on the issue of open grazing in the region is indeed a welcome development as it is also in the right direction. “We will continue to support them just as we have urged them to come out with bills on open grazing so that we in the State Houses of Assembly can see how we can pass the bill into law in order to give it a legal backing.” Copyright PUNCH.
