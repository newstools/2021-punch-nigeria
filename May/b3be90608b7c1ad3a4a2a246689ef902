Usman Abdallah, former coach of NPFL side, Wikki Tourist, has refused to state reasons why he parted ways with the club, but added that his wife warned him that he would suffer as a coach working in Nigeria, The PUNCH reports. Abdallah left the Bauchi-based club after 16 months in charge following a poor run of form that saw the club pick up a miserly eight points from their last 10 games. Interference from the club’s management was cited as key reason why the former Enyimba gaffer left the relegation-threatened club. But Abdallah, in an interview with The PUNCH, kept mum on why he resigned. He said, “Nigeria is a complicated country and I don’t want to talk much. I have a good relationship with Wikki Tourist even though we are now apart. “Maybe my orientation does not belong here. That’s why I don’t want to talk about my resignation. My second wife in Nigeria already warned me that I was going to suffer because this country is not a place for me to work. “She said if I’m not a hypocrite I can never achieve anything in this country. This is why I have refused to talk to anybody. I reserve my comments because it is my career. I won’t speak on why I left Wikki Tourist because they are nice people and I am in touch with the chairman. Everybody is happy but I just had to resign.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
