Former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has claimed that he became poorer after ruling the state for eight years. The Senator representing Imo West District at the ninth Senate said this while denying allegations that he acquired properties with government funds when he appeared as a  guest on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. He said, “I challenge anybody to prove that I acquired any property with any government fund. “I think people have forgotten that I was Rochas before becoming the governor of Imo State; I think they have forgotten completely. “If anything, becoming a governor made me even poorer than what I was in the past. I don’t know whether I acquired any property here in Abuja, there is none.” While narrating his encounter with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, he said, “I said to them (EFCC) that I have not come to respond to your call because there is already a matter in court and once a matter is sub judice, you cannot talk about it. “Imo State government has taken me to court on the same subject matter, and we are at the Federal High Court in Abuja on the same subject matter. “EFCC is doing their job because if there is no report, they can’t nose into whatever you are doing; EFCC is not witch-hunting, they are acting on a petition being written by somebody.”
