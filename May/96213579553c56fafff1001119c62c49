The Ogun State Government says 98 per cent of private estates selling land in the state have yet to get necessary approval from the government. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr Kayode Odunlami, stated this during the inauguration and electrification of Pelican-Brief Estate at Kobape, Abeokuta. The commissioner, however, added that efforts were being finalised to ensure that the estates followed due process to safeguard the interests of residents of the state. The commissioner noted that the government would continue to create an enabling environment for a private-public-partnership that would engender affordable housing in the state. He said, “This estate is the first to get complete approval from the government since I became commissioner. About 98 per cent of the estates being advertised have no approval. “They are doing illegal things; very soon, we’ll soon go after them.” Earlier, the Chief Executive Officer of the estate, Babatunde Adeyemo, said the electrification project and the state layout approval that were delivered within six months “are what some real estate firms might not deliver even in 10 years.” Copyright PUNCH.
