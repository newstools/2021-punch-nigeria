The Lagos State Government, on Thursday, said it trained 12,574 youths and women in key agricultural value chains, including fisheries, poultry, rice cultivation and processing, and horticulture in the last two years. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, stated this at a press briefing commemorating the second year in office of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. She explained that the training was to encourage more participation in agriculture as well as curb the problem of youth and women unemployment. According to her, if the state is to succeed in its goal of attaining food security and self-sufficiency of 40 per cent by 2023, the need to train more youths, who will take over from the aging farming population, cannot be overemphasised. Olusanya said, “Several initiatives have been implemented where no fewer than 12,574 women and youths have been trained in the various agricultural value chains, especially in fisheries, poultry, rice and horticulture. These are the areas where the state is considered to have some advantage. “One of such initiatives is the introduction of the Eko Schools’ Agric Comic and Agric App. It is believed that this will stir up the interest of youths and teenagers in the agriculture sector.” She noted that 19,207 youths and women were also empowered across all the agricultural value chains with inputs and productive assets through different schemes, including the annual Agricultural Value Chains Empowerment Programme.
