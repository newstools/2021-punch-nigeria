With the rising killings and kidnappings in the country, the Senior Pastor of the House on the Rock Church, Paul Adefarasin, has advised the members of his church to plan their exit from Nigeria. In a video trending on Twitter, the Pastor, who made the statement during his sermon on Sunday, said his wife, Ifeanyi, was absent from the service because she was taking care of their itineraries out of the country. The cleric of the Lagos-based church said, “I bring you greetings from Pastor Ifeanyi who is busy taking care of the frontier of our world and preparing our escape route.” Adefarasin added, “If you don’t have a plan B. I know you have faith, I have faith too but I have a plan B. “With technology, I can speak to you from anywhere in the world. “Get yourself a plan B. Whether that’s an Okada to Cameroon or a flying boat to Seme Border, a hole in the ground, a bunker as we call it. Just get yourself a plan B because these people are crazy. They are nutters, the whole bunch of them. And watch the signs because it can happen, just like this (snaps fingers).” The cleric had lately criticised the 1999 Constitution, saying the genesis of Nigeria’s problem was the document. “The foundation is that document and if the foundation is faulty, what can the righteous do? Go back to the foundation. “The next administration must not access power until we have a veritable constitution that is truly the document of we the people,” Adefarasin had said. The PUNCH reports that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has recently come under fire over the escalating kidnappings and killings in the country, with many losing confidence in the ability of Buhari, a retired military commander, who won the 2015 and 2019 general elections with the promise of ending the insecurity in the country.
