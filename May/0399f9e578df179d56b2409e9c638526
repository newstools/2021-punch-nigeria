The Chief Executive Officer of International Airlines Group, Luis Gallego, has pleaded with the British Government to amend flight restrictions. British Airways is under the IAG and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictions have been placed on flights and this has caused a major loss for airlines. According to DailyMail, Gallego said the airline lost about £1.1bn in the last ‘one year’, as he pleaded that people who are vaccinated or have been tested should travel “without restrictions.” Gallego asked for the implementation of travel corridors – allowing passengers to travel without having to quarantine on arrival nor upon their return- between countries, with reference to the “successful vaccination rollouts and effective testing, such as the UK and the US”. “We believe that the Government needs to be a bit ambitious in getting global travel back on track and bring the benefits of all the efforts that the Government and people have done with the vaccination rollout,” Gallego said. “I think they need to recognise that people who are vaccinated or have been tested can travel without restrictions,” Gallego said. He also asked that “affordable, simple and proportionate” Covid tests should replace the expensive tests, and the need to quarantine, along with “digital passes” for testing and vaccination documents to facilitate travel. These comments from Gallego come as British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will announce on Friday, the countries that British citizens can visit from May 17 without having to quarantine.
