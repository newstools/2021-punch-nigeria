The Director of Strategy, Food and Agribusiness, CDC Group Plc, Sami Khan, has said agriculture is a tool capable of ending poverty in countries around the world. Khan said this on Thursday while speaking about the importance of agriculture at a webinar sponsored by NAHCO Plc and Red Star Express Plc, with the theme ‘Unlocking trade and export opportunities in the agricultural sector.’ “It has been proven that the agricultural sector helps lessen poverty,” he said. Speaking on the role of the CDC Group to help transform countries around the world, he said the company would continue to stand with Nigeria in terms of partnership in the agricultural sector. “The CDC Group is fully owned by the UK government, operating over 400 investments since 1948 with countries around the world, especially in Africa. CDC is a well-placed partner in transforming the agricultural sector in Nigeria,” he added. The President, Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce, Kayode Falowo, noted that the National Bureau of Statistics said the Gross Domestic Product for agricultural sector in the first quarter of 2021 was lower than the GDP for Q4 2020. The NBS report showed that crop production grew by 2.31 per cent, compared to 3.68 per cent in Q4 2020, and 2.38 per cent in Q1 2020. According to him, crop production is a major driver of the agricultural sector. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
