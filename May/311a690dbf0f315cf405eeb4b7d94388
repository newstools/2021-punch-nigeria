MTN Nigeria has introduced ‘MTN Auto Top-Up’, a solution that helps customers manage their airtime and data availability needs by setting a time or threshold for automatic airtime and data recharge. This service gives customers complete control over the management of their airtime with a simple and secure sign-on and set-up process, according to a statement. The Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, said, “We are committed to providing a superior experience for our customers by addressing their pain points, meeting their needs, and creating value. “We understand that getting disconnected due to insufficient airtime or data is inconvenient and can be embarrassing so we came up with Auto Top-Up, which eliminates the issue.” According to the statement, MTN Auto Top-Up is accessible via MTN Web, USSD, and MyMTN App, and allows both new and existing subscribers activate the service, manage threshold and payment preferences, review transaction logs, add beneficiaries, and cancel whenever they wish. “With the introduction of the Auto Top-Up, we are confident that our customers will have a seamless and distinctive digital experience with new levels of simplicity, and convenience when it comes to recharging their lines,” Adebiyi added.
