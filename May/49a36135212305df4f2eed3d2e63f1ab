The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has said one-third of the proposed Kano-Kaduna rail project will be funded from national advancements of the Federal Ministry of Transportation’s budget. He disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja on Monday by the ministry’s Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Anastasia Ogbonna. The ministry said Ameachi disclosed this when he embarked on another inspection tour of the Lagos-Ibadan rail project on Sunday, barely a week after his last visit to the project site. It was, however, silent on the amount the government would provide for the Kano-Kaduna rail project. It said the minister stated that due to the processes involved in accessing loans, the ministry would proceed with the Ibadan-Kano rail project from the Kano end, pending when the loan would be granted. On the Lagos-Ibadan rail project, Amaechi was quoted as saying, “For the first time, we stopped in all the stations, that issue of platforms and others have been resolved. What you really need at a terminal, I believe is to get in and get out and that has been achieved. “It is not because the President will inaugurate every station, but because we want to make sure that as soon as we inaugurate, the trains will have to drop and pick passengers from the stations. No longer the make shifting they are doing now.” Meanwhile, the minister assured host communities adversely affected environmentally by the construction of the Lagos-Ibadan rail project that they would receive succour from the Federal Government. He assured the communities that issues of erosion or flooding occasioned by the construction would be addressed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
