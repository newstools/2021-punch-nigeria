THE Akwa Ibom State chapter of the People’s Democratic party, has denied rumours that Governor Udom Emmanuel is planning to dump the party to join the All Progressives Congress. This was contained in a statement by the State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Borono Bassey, in Uyo, on Tuesday. The statement which was made available to newsmen read in part, “We cannot conceive the faintest of reasons why Governor Emmanuel would contemplate any form of movement, even in thoughts from the PDP whose values and ideological leaning resonate with his total development and leadership agenda; let alone to a party like the APC, a party synonymous with retrogression. “What is clear however from these rumours is that the APC which is the principal shareholders in this rumour mills is desirous of having the focused, visionary and performing governor of Akwa Ibom State cross over to their sinking boat; perhaps, in the hope that his arrival could be the salvation that has for so long eluded them. “Our party, the PDP does not have even the miniscule sympathy for the APC in this shattered dream as our Governor and leader of our party cannot in all good conscience plunge our state into the impending retrogression that awaits any state that affiliates directly with the APC.” Copyright PUNCH.
