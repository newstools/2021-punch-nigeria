The International Civil Aviation Organization has said the recovery of air transport requires extensive and global Public Private Cooperation. The ICAO said efficient vaccine distribution and the sustainable recovery of air transport required extensive and global public- private cooperation. In a joint statement issued on Monday by the ICAO and the International Chamber of Commerce, the central role of international aviation in global economic and social development was highlighted. The statement was formalised by ICAO and ICC’s Secretaries General, Dr Fang Liu and Mr John Denton. It stressed both parties’ commitment to implement the ICAO Council Aviation Recovery Task Force guidance and recommendations. “Trans-border vaccine distribution requires effective public-private sector collaboration in order to ensure that supply chains function properly and so that ‘cold-chains’ are not broken or compromised,’’ said Liu. Liu also explained that aviation had permitted international vaccine supply chains to be successful thus far, and this closer cooperation between ICAO and the ICC will help ensure that continues. The statement also reiterated other recent calls on governments to prioritise aircrew in their national COVID-19 vaccination programmes, together with other essential workers, in accordance with the World Health Organization SAGE Roadmap for prioritising the use of COVID-19 vaccines.
