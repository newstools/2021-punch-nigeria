The National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria says Small and Medium Enterprises will play a significant role in the post-COVID-19 world. In a statement, the institute said conversations on this would be held at its two-day Annual Marketing Conference scheduled to hold later in May. Speaking ahead of the AMC, the President of NIMN, Tony Agenmonmen, said the conference’s theme was informed by the “very significant roles” that SMEs played in the economic and social lives of the nation, in terms of employment generation, poverty reduction, and contribution to the Gross Domestic Product. Agenmonmen said the AMC would be an avenue to present the account of stewardship of the institute’s leadership for the year ended December 31, 2020. He said, “This will be my last AMC as the president and chairman of the council of our great institute. Therefore, I will also use the occasion to present my stewardship for the over four years that I have had the privilege of leading my colleagues in the council, to lay a solid foundation and an irreversible growth for the institute.” Meanwhile, the institute said it had inaugurated an eight-man disciplinary panel to look into the activities of quacks in the profession.
