THE  Houses of Assembly in the South-East have been advised to give legal backing to the establishment of the region’s security outfit, Ebube Agu. Rising from the 10th synod of the Diocese of Umuahia Anglican Communion, the church also urged the Federal Government to expedite action on the unconditional release of Leah Sharibu. It also stated that “students and staff of Christian mission schools should not be compelled to wear uniforms such as hijab that are glaringly at variance with their faith”. The synod also expressed the need for the new service chiefs and heads of security agencies in the country to work in concert with each other, be proactive and sincere in tackling the security challenges in order to guarantee the safety of Nigerians. The church further urged the Federal Government to stop further contemplation of upward review of the price of fuel and electricity tariff, but should make the existing refineries in the country to work optimally. “Government should pay attention to the rehabilitation of the country’s railway system. The plan of extending rail lines to neighbouring countries when ours are moribund should be discouraged,” the church added, even as it called for the safety and availability of COVID-19 vaccines for Nigerians.
