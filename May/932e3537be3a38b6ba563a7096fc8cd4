American actor, Bryshere Gray, who played the role of Hakeem Lyon in Fox’s Empire series, has been reported to have entered a guilty plea in his domestic violence case. As part of his plea agreement, per the latest report, Gray will be required to spend a brief period in jail. Complex.com reports that Gray pleaded guilty to felony aggravated assault. He has also been sentenced to spend 10 days in county jail, in addition to being required to participate in a probation program for three years. Additionally, Gray is said to have been ordered to pay restitution and enrol in a domestic violence offender treatment program. Other related charges, according to court records viewed by Complex, were dismissed. In July 2020, a regional ABC outlet reported that Gray had been arrested in Goodyear, Arizona, in connection with a domestic violence incident. Police said at the time that they had first responded to a Circle K convenience store in the area around 10:15 p.m. after receiving a 911 call alerting them of a woman who had been assaulted. The victim, later confirmed to have been Gray’s wife, had flagged down a citizen for help after she said she had been assaulted at home for “hours” by Gray. Initially, Gray refused to exit his home when officers arrived. SWAT and Crisis Negotiations officials were then dispersed to the home, where Gray later surrendered to authorities early the following morning. He was then taken into custody and booked on domestic violence charges. The final episode of Empire aired in April of last year after a six-season run on FOX. As of late 2020, a spinoff focused on Taraji P. Henson’s character was no longer moving forward at FOX and was instead being shopped around to potential homes including Hulu and ABC.
