Leicester City forward Kelechi Iheanacho has once again been nominated for the English Premier League Player of The Month award. The Nigerian won the award for the month of March and is in contention to claim it again for the month of April. Due to his impressive form in 2021, Brendan Rogers started Iheanacho in all his side’s five EPL matches last month, with The Foxes winning two, drew one and lost two to earn seven points from a possible 15. The Foxes No.14 scored a total of four goals and grabbed another two assists in the month under review. Iheanacho scored a brace in his side 3-2 loss to West Ham United, and was also on target in back-to-back matches against West Brom and Crystal Palace. With his four goals and two assists against Crystal Palace and Southampton, Iheanacho contributed to 75 per cent of the goals scored by Leicester City last month. “Leicester City’s striker followed winning March’s EA SPORTS award by scoring four goals and registering two assists. His haul included superb strikes against West Ham United and Crystal Palace,” premierleague.com stated on why the 24-year-old was nominated for the award. Also in contention for the award are Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, Leeds United’s Stuart Dallas, Mason Greenwood (Manchester United), Jesse Lingard (West Ham), West Brom’s Matheus Pereira, Allan Saint-Maximin (Newcastle United) and Chris Wood (Burnley). Should Iheanacho win the award, he will join former West Brom striker Peter Odemwingie as the second Nigerian to claim the title twice in the same season. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
