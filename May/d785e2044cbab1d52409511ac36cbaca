A public health physician, Dr Opeyemi Adeyemi, has urged girls and women to maintain menstrual hygiene, saying menstrual health is the state of physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease in relation to the menstrual cycle. Adeyemi, who is also the founder of The Yemi Adeyemi Reprohealth Foundation, in an interview with our correspondent urged non-governmental organisations to provide free menstrual products to schools, IDP camps and  enforce the exemption of tax on menstrual products. “Menstrual hygiene is very important because it is a component of reproductive health. There are a lot of NGOs constantly creating awareness, having menstrual health outreaches and providing free menstrual products. I, however, feel that the burden cannot be placed on just NGOs, the government should do their part by providing sanitary toilets in schools where girls can change and dispose menstrual products. “Menstrual hygiene education is embedded in sex education. I’m an advocate for home-based sex education but I also emphasise the need for an age-appropriate sex education curriculum in schools,” she said. World Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28 annually. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
