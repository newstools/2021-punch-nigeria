Two transgender women in Cameroon have been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for attempted homosexuality and public indecency. Cameroon is one of 30 African countries where homosexuality is illegal. Shakiro, identified in police documents as Loïc Njeukam, and Patricia, referred to as Roland Mouthe, both identify as transgender and were arrested in February as they were having dinner at a restaurant in Douala, Cameroon’s economic capital. On Tuesday, they were also found guilty of failing to show proof of identity and given the maximum fine of 200,000 CFA francs, or $370. New York Times reports that Shakiro, a social media personality who has amassed tens of thousands of followers through her posts calling for more tolerance toward gender minorities in Cameroon, has stopped eating and shared plans to die by suicide since the verdict, according to her mother, Joséphine Marie Njeukam, who visited her in prison on Wednesday. Njeukam said her child told her, “‘Mum, I won’t survive here for five years.’” She said that her child didn’t kill anyone or steal, and that her sexuality “shouldn’t be a crime.” In recent months, lawyers and human rights groups have raised the alarm over what they described as an increase in arbitrary arrests based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the country. More than two dozen people were arrested from February to April on charges of homosexuality, according to Human Rights Watch and several of those arrested were subjected to beating and other forms of abuse. Shakiro, 23, and Patricia, 27, were at a restaurant in Douala on February 8 when police officers arrested them on charges of failing to provide identity documents. The two remained in prison for two months awaiting trial, according to their lawyer, Alice Nkom, and were sentenced on Tuesday. Nkom denounced the verdict as politically motivated, and said she had appealed the decision. Cameroon’s justice ministry did not respond to several requests for comment.
