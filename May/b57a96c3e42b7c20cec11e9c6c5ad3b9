Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Ike Shorunmu says coach Gernot Rohr’s invitation of Nigeria Professional Football League players for June’s friendly against Cameroon in Austria will boost the confidence of the home-based stars. Rohr’s provisional 31-man list has Enyimba’s  Anayo Iwuala and John Noble, as well as Heartland’s Ikechukwu Ezenwa. Speaking with The PUNCH, Shorunmu said, “The NPFL players would gain much from the experience and it would impact positively on their performance in their various clubs. “Look at a player like Anayo and Noble, it shows in their performance for their club. Their invitation during the African Cup of Nations qualifiers against Lesotho and Benin has increased their level of confidence. “There are still many good players in the NPFL, who, if invited, would also gain such experience, which is good for both country and club.” Copyright PUNCH.
