Popular Nollywood Actor Yomi Fabiyi led others to protest against the detention of his colleague, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha, who was accused of molesting a minor. During the protest, Fabiyi, and other protesters marched from Casino Bus Stop to Panti Police Station on Wednesday. They demanded that Baba Ijesha should be released from detention pending when a court would hear his case. The protesters carried placards and banners with various inscriptions such as ‘denial of bail of bailable offence is human rights violation’, ‘Nigeria police, please allow the law to dictate to you, not Iyabo Ojo, Princess and co’, ‘Release Baba Ijesha’, and ‘Nigeria police must respect human rights and honour bail for bailable offence’, Fabiyi, who has been supportive of Baba Ijesha, described the continuous detention of Baba Ijesha as “illegal”.
