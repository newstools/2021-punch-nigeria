The Minister of the  Federal Capital Territory, Muhammad  Bello,  has directed that Eid prayers should not hold at the National Eid prayer ground along the Umaru  Yar’adua Expressway, Abuja, during this year’s Eid-il-Fitri. He said the decision was based on presentations made by officials of the Health and Human Services Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration and the implementation guidelines for Phased Restriction of Movement  issued by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 on Monday. The minister said this during a meeting he had with a delegation of the FCT League of Imams Initiative, led by its Chairman, Imam Tajudeen  Adigun. The minister’s Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. He urged worshippers to hold Eid prayers in their neighborhood Juma’at mosques. The statement reads in part, “All worshippers are enjoined to hold Eid prayers outdoors within the premises of their neighborhood Juma’at mosques. “Indoor worshippers are to be limited to less than 50 percent of installed capacity. “Religious authorities are advised to regulate the flow of people entering and exiting places of worship. “All non-pharmaceutical intervention protocols of facial coverings, physical distancing and hand washing are to be observed.” Copyright PUNCH.
