Staff of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Tuesday swore an oath, committing not to leak official documents and information. The EFCC said in a statement that the oaths were administered in line with the Official Secrets Act and the newly adopted Document Classification Policy of the EFCC. The Act states that any person who obtains, reproduces or retains any classified document which he is not authorised on behalf of the government to obtain, may be guilty of an offence and liable to conviction. The EFCC in a statement titled, ‘EFCC Staff Take Fresh Oath of Allegiance’ which was signed by its Spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, stated that the staff also pledged to perform their duties diligently. It read in part, “As part of ongoing reform efforts to improve efficient delivery of its mandate, officials of the EFCC today May 18, 2021 took fresh official oaths, pledging among others, to perform their duties diligently and honestly. “The Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, led other categories of staff to take the oath in compliance with the Official Secrets Act and the newly adopted Document Classification Policy of the commission.”
