The Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Mr. Danladi Umar, has failed to appear before the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, probing his alleged assault on a security guard in Abuja last month. The committee had earlier granted the CCT chairman a two-week grace period to respond to a petition levelled against him over his alleged assault on one Mr. Clement Sagwak, when he appeared before the panel penultimate week. Umar, on the occasion, sought the benevolence of the panel to return at a later date to respond to the specific allegations contained in the petition because the notice given to him was short. The committee obliged the CCT chairman’s request and asked him to report on May 18. But rather than Umar, appearing before the panel on Tuesday, he sent a message to the Committee that he could not attend the session purely on health grounds and that he had travelled out of the country. He then sought the permission of the lawmakers for him to be represented by his counsel but the panel objected to his request. The committee Chairman, Ayo Akinyelure said, “We are denying the request of Mr. Umar due to the sensitivity of the matter but we will allow him to appear in person at a later date when he is physically fit to come.” The committee then extended the public hearing on the matter by another three weeks . The panel asked Umar, to appear before it on the 7th of June 2021.
