The Christian Association of Nigeria has felicitated with the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs and all Muslims in Nigeria on the occasion of the successful completion of Ramadan. The association also advised the council to caution extremists who were not well grounded in Islam. CAN’s General Secretary, Daramola Joseph, conveyed the message in a statement on Thursday titled, ‘CAN rejoices with NSCIA, Muslims at Sallah.’ It read in part, “We are not unaware that your fasting was in obedience to the divine directive:  ‘O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous’ Surat Al-Baqarah 2:183. “May God answer all your godly prayers offered throughout the month. “We appeal to the leadership of the NSCIA to continue to caution the extremists who are not well grounded in the faith and whose wicked and ungodly actions are giving bad names to Islam. “It is trite to know that no godly person will engage in the promotion of violence, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism or identify with the perpetrators.” The association also appreciated the efforts that are being put in place by the police and other security agencies in ensuring a peaceful celebration while also praying that the leaders receive the fear of God to do what is right, just and Godly.
