RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has described those propagating the conspiracy theory that the Niger Delta is unsafe as the real enemies of the oil and gas rich region. The governor stated these when he performed the groundbreaking of Giwa Gas FZE gas and fertilizer project at Okoroinyong village, Eastern Obolo Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State on Wednesday. Wike, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said if Akwa Ibom was not safe, there was no way any prospective investor would conceive the idea of building a gas and fertilizer plant in the state. “If Akwa Ibom State is not safe, will investors come here? Investors are here because the governor has provided an enabling environment and that gives confidence to the investors. If a place is not secure for people to invest their money, we won’t be here. “Don’t mind the enemies of the people who will always say that Niger Delta is not safe. If it is not safe, can anyone come and invest money here?” The statement said Wike also performed the groundbreaking of the Akwa Ibom Teaching Hospital at Awa in Onna Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and pledged N600m to the project. Earlier, Governor Udom Emmanuel explained that when he was campaigning for re-election in 2019, he promised to give a lot of attention to the riverine areas of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
