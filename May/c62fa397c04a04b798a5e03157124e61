A non-governmental organisation, Gethsemane Women Fellowship, an arm of the House of Freedom, Lagos, has decried the high rate of infant mortality in the country. According to World Bank statistics, in 2019, the infant mortality rate in Nigeria was at about 74.2 deaths per 1,000 live births – worse than in countries like Afghanistan (47), Benin Republic (59), and Cameroon (50). In a bid to contribute to the reduction of Nigeria’s infant mortality rate, Gethsemane Women Fellowship said it gifted an incubator to the Massey Street Children’s Hospital, Lagos. According to a statement, the event happened on Thursday to mark the 2021 Children’s Day. The GWF coordinator, Pastor Loveth Orhonor, said the choice of an incubator was because it was one of the most important medical items needed for newborns struggling with their lives. She quoted World Health Organisation reports stating that around one million infants die annually due to the lack of incubators in most hospitals. Orhonor, who was represented by Pastor Awesiri Eyieyien, stated that the donation was in furtherance of the role that Gethsemane Women Fellowship plays in the lives of women all over the world. The hospital’s Medical Director/CEO, Doctor, Mrs Abimbola Mabogunje, commended the GWF for the donation. “An incubator is a good thing; we need incubators for newborns who struggle with their lives and we are glad that Gethsemane Women came to our aid,” she said.
