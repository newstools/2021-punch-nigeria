A mob on Wednesday meted out jungle justice to a crime suspect in Bayelsa State. The incident happened around Customs Road in the Biogbolo-Epie area of the state capital, Yenagoa. It was gathered that the unidentified young man was among a three-member gang who specialised in using tricycle also known as Keke to rob residents. The mob also set ablaze the Keke with Ministry of Transport registration number 9583 used by the hoodlums. While one of them was arrested by the police, the third member was said to have escaped. An eyewitness, Jude Azubuike, said the criminals were pursued to the scene by their victims whom they had robbed in another part of the community and collected his money and POS machine. He said that luck ran out on the gang when the driver of a Hilux van, who overhead the POS operator shouting “thief, thief” pursued the criminals and blocked their tricycle with his vehicle. Azubuike said, “As they tried to run away, one of them was caught and beaten to death, one escaped and the other was arrested and taken away by the police. “They robbed one man at Erepa Road and collected his money and POS machine. But the man followed them with another Keke until they were caught here.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Mr Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident and said that the arrested suspect was in custody.
