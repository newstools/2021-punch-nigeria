THE Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike has called on true nationalists who believe in the indivisibility of Nigeria to rise and work together to rescue her from disintegration. Wike made the call when he hosted members of the South-South Zonal Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party in Government House, Port Harcourt, on Thursday.The governor in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said it was obvious that the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government had not only lost capacity to solve the protracted insecurity problem plaguing the country, but did not have any iota of empathy for Nigerians. He stated, “APC governors have come out to say the present APC Federal Government will solve the security problems. But every day, people are dying. When will they solve the problems? “Own up and say to Nigerians we have failed on the promises that we made to you. And honourably say as it is done in other advanced countries that since we cannot perform and carry out the covenant we have with Nigerians, we have decided to quit. “Every reasonable Nigerian, every nationalist who believes in this country should come up and make sure this country moves forward; if not, it is going to affect everybody,” the statement read.
