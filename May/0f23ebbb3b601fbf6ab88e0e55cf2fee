The Federal Government has said that it will inaugurate the Lagos-Ibadan railway project in June. The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who said this on Monday at the monthly inspection of the Lagos-Ibadan railway project also disclosed that the ministry would soon inaugurate a railway university. He said, “There are one or two problems that we encountered and once that is solved, we intend to commission sometime in June. “The work we started in 2017 or 2018 has come to conclusion. All the 10 or 11 stations are almost ready. Some of the overpasses and underpasses are ready.” The minister further disclosed that the second part of the contract which is Ebute Metta to the seaport was almost completed and when ready, cargoes would be transported from the seaport by rail to Ibadan. The minister said the model of Mobolaji Johnson Station (Ebute Metta) was replicated in Itakpe, Abeokuta, and Ibadan, adding that the same would be done along the Ibadan-Kano route and other parts of the country. On the railway university, the Amaechi said the essence was ‘to train our young ones on how to manage the institution at the completion of the project’. “Those that are in China will come back to the university and train others to manage the infrastructure,” he said. Others at the inspection tour were the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Magdalene Ajani, the Director, Legal Services, Pius Oteh, the Chairman, Nigerian Railway Corporation, Mr Ibrahim Musa, amongst others.
