A former governor of Ebonyi State, Dr Sam Egwu, has advocated the return of History in school curricula in the country. Egwu said this at the presentation of the book, titled, ‘Architecture Confluence: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow’, held at the Julius Berger Hall of the University of Lagos. The former education minister and senator representing Ebonyi North, who was also the chairman on the occasion, said the absence of History in teaching curricula had affected the field of architecture. He said, “The absence of History in our educational curriculum is affecting every facet of our national life. That is also reflecting in the architectural designs we are having in our buildings and that was why I talked about the relevance and the importance of this book. “We can’t progress without history; in all facets of life, you must know where you started and how to move forward.” Copyright PUNCH.
