Hundreds of protesting Ijaw youths on Thursday shut down the Headquarters of the Niger Delta Development Commission Eastern By-Pass in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The protesters under the aegis of the Ijaw Youths Council, numbering over 700, all dressed in the council’s uniform. They hoisted the Green-Red-Blue IYC flag in front of the commission’s secretariat, preventing any human and vehicular entry. The Ijaw youths mounted two tents in front of the main entrance of the newly commissioned complex, singing and dancing to solidarity songs. Assistant Secretary of IYC, Eastern Zone, Ibiso Harry, said the action was directed by the IYC President, Peter Igbifa, following the expiration of the deadline given to the Federal Government to constitute a substantive board for the NDDC. A team of policemen with security vehicles were spotted at the complex monitoring the protesting youths, who vowed to remain until the NDDC board was inaugurated.
