Kwara State Government has rolled out plans to support young entrepreneurs in the state with huge interest-free loans. The Acting General Manager of Kwara State Social Investment Programme, Mohammed Brimah, who disclosed this in a statement, said the first phase of the programme targeted at least 300 youngsters with viable business proposals. He added that at least 1,200 young people would benefit from the initiative over the next four years. Brimah explained that successful applicants would be trained and supported with interest free loans ranging from N350,000 to N3,000,000 each, depending on the scale of their proposed businesses. “The programme will give successful applicants between N350,000 and N3,000,000 interest-free, while looking to equip them with skills, knowledge, and opportunities to become sustainably empowered in society. This is Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq’s definition of empowerment.” Brimah said young people involved in high-potential business areas like agro-processing, logistics, transportation, among others, should apply.
