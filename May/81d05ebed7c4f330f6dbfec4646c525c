A Rivers State chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Chukwuemeka Eze, has berated the Peoples Democratic Party, for calling for the sacking of the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, over the alleged financial scandal in the Nigerian Ports Authority. Eze said this in a statement in Port Harcourt, on Thursday. He noted that the opposition party was the least qualified entity to talk about the anti-graft war of the current administration. The statement read in part, “All the PDP needs to do is to allow responsible individuals and organizations make comments on critical issues and not those who lacked moral standing to make comments on corruption and matters connected thereto.” He said the opposition party was yet to fully account for the huge resources Nigeria made under the watch of the PDP which held power for 16 unbroken years. According to him, the PDP has nothing to show for the years it spent at the helm of affairs other than corruption and dilapidated infrastructure which the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has been trying very hard to repair since coming to power in 2015. The statement further read, “The N165 billion allegedly swindled at NPA is being investigated and that exercise is the brainchild of the Transportation Minister whose stance against corruption is anchored on piety, love for humanity and crave for societal development.” The party stalwart said the latest onslaught against Amaechi was part of contrived schemes by the opposition party to fight back at the former Rivers Governor for his roles in wresting the country from the corrupt claws of the former ruling party during the 2015 elections.
