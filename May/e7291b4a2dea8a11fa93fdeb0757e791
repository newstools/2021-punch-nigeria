N’Golo Kanté has been named player of the match for the 2021 UEFA Champions League final after helping Chelsea defeat Manchester City 1-0 in Porto. The French international was a consistently solid presence in the Blues midfield, harrying his City counterparts and thwarting attacks with shrewd interceptions. Likewise named player of the match in both of Chelsea’s semi-final contests with Real Madrid, Kanté also put in a crucial tackle on Kevin De Bruyne early in the second half and looked to carry the ball forward whenever possible. “UEFA gave an official Player of the Match award after every 2020/21 UEFA Champions League knockout stage game to recognise the top performers in Europe’s top club competition. “The UEFA technical observers at each game decided who deserved to be the Player of the Match, with an official trophy handed to the successful candidate after full time.
