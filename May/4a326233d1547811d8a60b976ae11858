Some Nigerians have taken to the social media to slam Abidemi Rufai, a Senior Special Assistant to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, over a $350,000 employment fraud. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Rufai on Friday evening at the John F Kennedy International Airport in New York based on the criminal complaint. Reacting to the arrest, Nigerians have taken to Twitter to lambast Rufai, saying his greed led him to the ignoble act. A user with the handle @firstladyship tweeted, “Abidemi Rufai is another exemple of the ‘Lekki Big Boy’. In a country with the poorest people in the world, some have chosen the ‘Road to Perdition.’ Not all you see on social media is legit. So don’t get carried away by the glitz and glamour. Greed kills!” Another user @oluomoofderby tweeted, “Abidemi Rufai’s story should be a lesson to every one of us. Many people are living fake lifestyles. He should be expecting 20/25 yrs in American prison.” @girllikehelen wrote, “This tweet is for those engaging in credit card fraud. You can continue stealing from the US but one day, you will get caught. They will carry out their investigations and nail you when you least expect it. Abidemi Rufai is just one of the many guys that will go down.” Another tweep, @uncle_ajala, called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to unravel more scammers in Nigeria. “I still blame the Nigerian Government for everything! Nigerians are talented and energetic, but no enabling environment. Everything now is money and no one wants to carry last! Imagine if Abidemi Rufai and Hushpuppi have enabling environment to contribute their ICT knowledge,” @shexzy05 tweeted. @faithomino, however, described the situation as “unfortunate and embarrassing.”
