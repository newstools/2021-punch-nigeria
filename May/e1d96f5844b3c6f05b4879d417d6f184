The Federal Government has declared Wednesday and Thursday as public holidays to mark this year’s Eid-el-Fitr celebration. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, while making the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government, congratulated Muslim faithful. He called on all Nigerians to use the period to pray for peace, stability and economic transformation in the land. This was contained in a statement on Monday by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Dr Shuaib Belgore. The statement titled, ‘FG declares Wednesday 12th, Thursday 13th May 2021 as public holiday to mark Eid-il-Fitr celebration,’ urged Nigerians to be law-abiding and embrace the spirit of love, self-discipline, tolerance. Aregbesola  assured all of the resolve of the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.),  to end the scourge of crime and criminality in the country. “This administration will not be deterred in its efforts until every Nigerian and resident of the country is free to move around without fear of any threat to his/her life and property. “We are therefore putting necessary measures and strategies in place to strengthen the stability of the country as well as ensuring economic prosperity of our dear nation,” the minister said.
