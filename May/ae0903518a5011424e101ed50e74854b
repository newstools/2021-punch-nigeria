The Pan-Northern socio-political organisation, Arewa Consultative Forum has expressed concern over the endless killings by gunmen in Benue State. The ACF National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, made this known in a statement released in Kaduna on Sunday. The statement reads in part, “The Arewa Consultative Forum is alarmed at the number of reported cases of mass killings it has from Benue State of recent. “The most recent and gruesome is the one on Thursday last week in which about 40 people were murdered in one day and another large number of people dislodged from their home at Shikaan village in Mbamena ward in Katsina Ala Local Government Area of the state. “The country home of a retired senior naval Commodore Iyortyer Afeah, who is from the village was completely burnt down with the four people who were inside. Another prominent indigenes of the village whose houses were burnt are the late wife of Justice Katsina Alu, Mrs Victoria Alu, a former Chief Justice of Nigeria CJN; a retired Deputy Controller General of Immigration, Mr Denen Akaa. “We at the ACF are worried about the rampant loss of life in Benue and the seemingly desperate attempts by the state government to twist the narrative for political reasons and the security agencies who are not giving accurate accounts of the security situation in Benue for reasons that are difficult to see.” Copyright PUNCH.
