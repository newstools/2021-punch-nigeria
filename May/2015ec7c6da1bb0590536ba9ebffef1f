Notore Chemical Industries Plc, is on course to produce 500,000 tonnes of fertilisers after its recent Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) programme. The group’s managing director, Ohis Ohiwerei, was quoted in a statement issued by the company on Sunday, to have said, “The completion of the TAM ushers in a new phase in the company’s growth with a focus on optimisation and profitability. “Notore is committed to continuous improvement. We expect a major upturn in the plant’s reliability and production output to meet and sustain its 500,000MT per annum nameplate design capacity.” “Achieving this level of production output will not only lead to significant increases in the company’s cash flows from operations, but also substantial increases in revenues annually.” Copyright PUNCH.
