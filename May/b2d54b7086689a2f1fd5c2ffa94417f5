Plans have been concluded by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development to set up electoral committees for elections into the boards of the recently dissolved sports federations. The ministry on April 30 dissolved the boards of 30 National Sports Federations, following the expiration of their tenures. A  Director in the ministry,  Dr. Simeon Ebhojiaye, said, “In order to avoid a vacuum in running the affairs of the federations, the ministry swiftly constituted a three-man caretaker committee for each to hold forth before the elections that will take place in September 2021. As part of efforts to organise concise and credible elections that will stand the test of time, the ministry has concluded arrangements to set up Electoral Committees which will conduct the federations’ elections in September 2021. “The ministry will not rest on its oars in ensuring that its mandate, mission and vision are achieved in repositioning the sports sector in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
