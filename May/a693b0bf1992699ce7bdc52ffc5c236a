The Business Solutions Manager at CWG Plc, Mr. Olusegun Ajayi has explained how consistency in its value offerings has earned the Pan-African Information and Communications Technology company an edge over in the tech industry for almost three decades. According to Mr. Ajayi, consistency has allowed CWG to demonstrate the ability to dictate the market in various segment of the economies of Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroun and Uganda; resulting from its experience over the years. “We have shown consistency and thus became a leader in the market. We are also creating a market shift for others to follow; leading the pack on new engagement strategies,” he said, adding that there are business indicators that show CWG is on course to achieving its set goals and objectives. The CWG brand has been in existence since 1992; surviving through many market and economic scenarios but maintained consistency in its value offerings. This, however, Ajayi said the company is not unaware of potential drift in the mind and market share. In response to CWG’s present strategies to ensure that potential drift doesn’t undermine the company’s leadership position, Mr. Ajayi disclosed that CWG is making investments to consolidate its market position with engagements ongoing to identify some of the factors that could cause market resistance for appropriate attention. The IT Services industry in Nigeria and Sub-Sahara Africa is densely saturated; this is mainly due to how easy it is for a new player to get into the industry. The rate at which skilled resources lose their jobs is compounding the growth of competition in the market. The increasing competition makes it imperative for service providers to create new markets and the need for speed.  Thus, in 2019, CWG initiated a shift from the traditional market engagement strategy to create new terrain for competition. This initiative met initial resistance from clients, but it gradually got adoption with partners aligning.
