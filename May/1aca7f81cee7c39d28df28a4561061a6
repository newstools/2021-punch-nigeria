Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, says seed money has been earmarked by his administration to encourage massive cultivation of cassava across the state, even as he solicited fresh loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Wike said this at the inauguration of the Rivers State Cassava Processing Plant at Afam Town in the Oyigbo Local Government Area of the State on Thursday. The governor, in a statement by his media aide, Kekvin Ebiri, expressed the willingness of his administration to encourage proper cultivation of the vast fallow land available in all local government areas of the state to ensure that the processing plant would not lack raw materials. He said the seed money would not be administered like previous grants offered by the state government, but would be given to genuine farmers after being verified and encouraged to increase the production of cassava. He stated, “The other day, I went to see one of my friends. I went to his farm of over 56 hectare of land. He’s trying to cultivate cassava and I was very impressed.” Copyright PUNCH.
