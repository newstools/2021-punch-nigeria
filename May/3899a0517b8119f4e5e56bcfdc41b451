A 70-year-old man, Michael Omolayo, suspected to be a ritualist has been arrested in Akure, the Ondo State capital, for packing human hair in large quantities at a barbershop. It was gathered that Omolayo was almost lynched by some irate residents of Oke-Emesho area of Akure, after he was caught in the act. It was also gathered that the man received the hair from a woman who had allegedly assisted him to pack the hair from a shop owned by a barber identifed as Desmond. His luck however ran out as he was sighted by some residents who immediately raised the alarm. A source said some of the people attempted to lynch Omolayo but were prevailed upon. The residents thereafter went to search the septuagenarian’s house. He said, “Some strange objects were found in the house and this prompted the head of the community, Chief James Abiodun, to order his arrest and be taken to the Deji of Akure’s palace along with the strange objects found in his house. The community head also said the issue could only be resolved through traditional means.” The woman, who was seen handing over the human hair to the suspect, reportedly confessed to the allegation at the Deji’s palace. The Chief Press Secretary to the Deji of Akure, Mr Michael Adeyeye, confirmed the incident and said the palace would hand over the suspect to the police. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
