Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has assured that the breath-taking performance of long jumper Ese Brume at the Chula  Vista Festival in the US, where she shattered Chioma Ajunwa’s 25-year African record would propel her to excel at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Brume leapt 7.17m to beat Olympic champion  Britney Reese and Chantley Malone to the second and third positions respectively. Her jump erased the record of compatriot Ajunwa, who leapt 7.12 to win gold at the  Atlanta Olympics in 1996. “Congratulations to Ese Brume for her impressive performances at the Sandiago Chula Vista Festival. She was simply fantastic, cool, confident and composed. Her performance was not only fantastic,  but a motivation to others as Team Nigeria continues the build- up to the Tokyo Olympics,” Dare said in a statement. “This feat would send the right signals to the world that Nigerian athletes mean business and would not be pushovers at the Olympics. We  have provided all support to our team to actualise  the  dream of podium success  at the Olympics.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
