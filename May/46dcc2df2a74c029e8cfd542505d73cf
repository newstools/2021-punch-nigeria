Roma goalkeeper Pau Lopez will miss out in Thursday’s Europa League semi-final second leg against Manchester United in Rome. United are on the brink of reaching the final in Gdansk after thrashing Roma 6-2 in last week’s semi-final first leg at Old Trafford. Lopez misses out after dislocating his shoulder in the first leg with Daniel Furzato and Antonio Mirante competing for the position. Fonseca made seven changes for the weekend defeat to Sampdoria in Serie A, with Leonardo Spinazzola, Jordan Veretout and Amadou Diawara all injured. Defender Gianluca Mancini is available after suspension and former United defender Chris Smalling and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will hope to be in the starting line-up again. Also, Daniel James did not travel with the Manchester United squad due to injury. The 23-year-old was absent from the squad named for Sunday’s ultimately postponed Premier League clash against Liverpool. James joins Anthony Martial and Phil Jones on the sidelines, with Amad Diallo and Anthony Elanga named as part of the 24-man squad heading to Italy.
