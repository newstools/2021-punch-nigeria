The Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency has extended its sensitisation and awareness programme to schools in the state to educate students on their rights as consumers. The General Manager of the agency, Mr Afolabi Solebo, in a statement on Sunday said the initiative was geared towards ensuring that students were enlightened at the formative stage on their rights as consumers. He was quoted to have said this at the Government Technical College, Agidingbi, where he was represented by the Director, Consumer Education, Folashade Ashaye, at the programme. “The protection of the rights of consumer since the establishment of LASCOPA has taken the centre stage because the state government realised the need to treat consumers, especially Lagos consumers, as kings who have rights under the law to be protected,” Solebo said. The General Manager of LASCOPA urged the student and consumers of goods and services to realise they have responsibilities to carry out, saying that an informed consumer could bring changes to society.
