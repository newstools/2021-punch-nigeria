Children of a deceased patient at the National Hospital, Abuja, on Tuesday, beat up a nurse whom they accused of causing their father’s death. An official of the hospital, who did not want to be identified, said the incident happened around 8am. The source said, “I heard a voice inside the male ward and I went to see what was happening. I saw a nurse running out. “While trying to ask what happened, I saw a man who plaited his hair pursuing her. The nurse’s clothes were torn and rumpled. “I tried to restrain the man, but I saw his brother and sister coming out too. I couldn’t stop them, but my boss came and they were taken away.” The relative of another patient who was present when the incident happened said the nurse was tired when she was called to attend to the deceased. “The children of the man called the nurse, but we only had one nurse on duty, so I think she was tired. “After trying to call her to come and attend to the man and there was no reply, the man gave up the ghost. That was when they went to drag and beat her. “At some points, they pressed her neck to the ground and accused her of killing their father before she was able to escape,” he added. The National Hospital Public Relations Officer, Mr Tayo Haastrup, confirmed the incident. He said, “The family abandoned the patient and did not buy drugs. They later came for discharge against medical advice. “All the while, the hospital had been taking care of the patient despite the fact that they were not doing anything on their part.” Haastrup added that instead of being grateful, the family members harassed the nurse on duty. He said the case had been reported to the police and the nurses’ association for appropriate action. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
