Enyimba failed to make their early lead pay, as they lost 4-1 to Pyramids in their quarter-final first leg of the CAF Confederation Cup at the June 30 Stadium, Cairo on Sunday. Enyimba, who missed the services of Eagles forward Anayo Iwuala – out through suspension – took the lead with less than a minute on the clock, with Victor Mbaoma breaking the deadlock. Last year’s losing finalists Pyramids however found their way back into the game, equalising through Ramadan Sobhi in the 15th minute. Both sides went into half-time even, with the home side unlucky not to be ahead after several onslaughts on the Enyimba defence. Pyramids resumed the second half where they left off at half time, and were quickly rewarded with their second goal after Abdallah El-Said hit the back of the net in the 49th minute. Ibrahim Adel’s beautiful bicycle kick, which found the back of the net in the 58th minute, gave the home side a two-goal cushion. He doubled his tally nine minutes later, to help secure a 4-1 first leg victory. Fatai Osho’s side will hope they can make their away goal count and win by at least three unreplied goals when both sides meet in the reverse fixture at the Enyimba Stadium, Aba next Sunday to have any hopes of advancing to the semi-final stage.
