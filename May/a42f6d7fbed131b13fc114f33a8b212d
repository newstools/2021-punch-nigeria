A United Nation’s report has said that Nigeria’s economic growth will remain subdued at 1.8 per cent in 2021, underpinned by high inflation, unemployment and slow vaccination, which will continue to depress consumer spending and business investment. The organisation said this in a report titled World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2021. The report stated that the Gross Domestic Product of Africa was projected to expand by 3.6 per cent in 2021 due to strengthening global prospects, rising exports and higher commodity prices. Per capita incomes are expected to recover to pre-COVID-19 crisis levels by 2024. Speaking on the report, UN Chief Economist, Elliot Harris, said, “Vaccine inequity between countries and regions is posing a significant risk to an already uneven and fragile global recovery. “Timely and universal access to COVID-19 vaccinations will mean the difference between ending the pandemic promptly and placing the world economy on the trajectory of a resilient recovery, or losing many more years of growth, development and opportunities.” The UN quoted a report by the International Labour Organisation which disclosed that 8.8 per cent of total working hours – equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs – were lost in 2020 while 81 million people worldwide left the labour force, resulting in a decline in the global labour force participation rate by 2.2 per cent in 2020. The report added that women and girls were the extraordinary collateral damages as there were as many as 1.4 million unintended pregnancies that occurred in 2020 across 115 developing countries due to disruption in access to and use of contraceptives with possible life-changing consequences.
