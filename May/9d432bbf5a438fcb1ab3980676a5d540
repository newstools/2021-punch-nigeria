Human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, on Thursday said Mrs Remi Tinubu, wife of All Progressives Congress chieftain, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, displayed “disgusting arrogance” on Wednesday when she called a woman a thug during a public hearing of the constitutional review in Lagos. Yesufu made this known in an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday. The PUNCH had earlier reported that viral video showed that the Senator representing Lagos Central was involved in a shouting match with some Nigerians who attended the event at the Marriot Hotel in Lagos. Tinubu is leading the Senate Committee on Review of the 1999 Constitution in the South-West. However, there was a ruckus with a yet-to-be-identified woman was denied entry into the venue. The woman, who protested her exclusion from the venue, was flayed by Mrs Tinubu for being “rude”. Some Nigerians at the scene subsequently asked the senator to apologise to her but Mrs Tinubu said, “I will not apologise for what I said. I saw it and I said it.” Reacting, Yesufu said, “It’s so much disgusting arrogance from a senator who is an elected official to speak to citizens in that manner and this is not the first time Remi Tinubu is doing this. She looks down on people. I’m sure she is used to people who come to her, rolling on the floor and she thinks everybody will bow before her family. That is why she keeps on carrying this arrogance around.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
