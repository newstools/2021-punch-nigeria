The President, Nutrition Society of Nigeria, Prof. Wasiu Afolabi, has advised Nigerians to consume more foods with vitamins and energy,  saying these and other nutrients are needed for optimal growth. Afolabi said this at the unveiling of the newly improved Kellogg’s Cornflakes by the Tolaram group. He said, “The body requires modest amount of energy, vitamins A, B2,B3,B6,B9, B12, C and D for optimal growth. We are excited to be a part of this initiative which has come with the proposition of healthy alternative breakfast packed with essential nutrition for everyone. “The Nutrition Society of Nigeria is proud to identify with such an organisation always willing to go back to make modifications as expedient for the satisfaction of the public without compromising the global quality. It is not only an important diet for children but also beneficial for adults. The Chief Marketing Officer of the firm, Mr Girish Sharma, said the product was first introduced in 2018 before being withdrawn following consumers’ feedback on taste which was causally linked to technology and other local restraining factors. “The team went back to the drawing board and have now come back to introduce the proudly made in Nigerian cornflakes, which by every means matches up to the international quality standard in terms of taste, texture, look and feel and nutritional benefits,” he said.
