The Saudi Ministry of Health has said only 60,000 local and international pilgrims will be allowed to perform this year’s holy pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. It said those performing hajj must be between 18 and 60 years, and must be in good health and had not been hospitalised in the past six months prior to the journey for the pilgrimage. The information, which was posted on the ministry’s Twitter handle, Haramain, noted that pilgrims must have taken both doses of vaccine with vaccination cards provided by their countries, health organisations, hospitals and ministry. It stated, “The vaccine taken must be on the approved list that is recognised by the ministry of health within the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. “The intended pilgrims must be quarantined for three days, if they are classed as foreign pilgrims as soon as they arrive in the kingdom. “The condition of social distancing and wearing of masks must be observed, and other precautionary measures to protect the pilgrims against the spread of the virus.” Copyright PUNCH.
