The Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 on Thursday released the second batch of travellers who violated travel advisory. The Chairman of the committee, Boss Mustapha, in a statement said the violators had been declared Persons of Interest after evading the mandatory seven-day quarantine for persons arriving from restricted countries. He also listed their punishments to include disabling their travel passports for a period not less than one year, cancelation of visas/ permits of foreigners that have abused Nigeria’s hospitality, and prosecution under the 2021 Health Protection Regulations. The names of 132 violators were listed in the statement. This is in addition to the 90 violators that made the first list released on Sunday. The statement reads partly, “Members of the public are by this notice advised that these persons of interest constitute an immediate health hazard to the society. “They must therefore transport themselves safely, to the nearest state public health departments within 48hrs of this notice for immediate evaluation and call the Port Health Services, Federal Ministry of Health on 08036134672 or 08032461990 for further directions. “The PSC shall in addition, take further steps to sanction these violators.
