Students under the aegis of the Muslim Students Society of Nigeria, Lagos State Area Unit, on Friday, urged the Federal Government, the new Chief of Army Staff, Faruk Yahaya, and other service chiefs to review military operations. This, the group said, would help to fight insecurity and prevent a similar plane crash that led to the death of Nigeria’s Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Attahiru Ibrahim, and others. The students also prayed for peace in Nigeria and Palestine during a virtual Special Usrah to commemorate the 2021 MSS Week in Lagos. Amir (president) of MSSNLagos, Mallam Miftahudeen Thanni, described the death of the military officers as painful. He, however, urged the late officers’ colleagues to be undaunted in the fight against terrorism despite the loss, saying that the roles of the deceased would not be easily forgotten. Thanni said, “This is a great loss at this trying period in the country. Honestly, the crash is becoming too many and it’s not good on the country’s fight against insurgency. This is not good for the military. The Federal Government and service chiefs should kindly look inwards and find out what is happening concerning our equipment.” He also called on Nigerians to intensify prayers toward ensuring that national disasters are prevented from reoccurring.
