The Industrial Training Fund has solicited partnership with the Ogun State Government to sponsor youths in skills acquisition schemes. The Area Manager and Deputy Director, ITF, Abeokuta Area Office, Mrs Funmi Coker, said this in Abeokuta on Thursday at the closing ceremony of the 2020 National Industrial Skills Development Programme in the state. Coker said the ITF had trained 105 indigenes of the state in fashion design and garment making, Information and Communication Technology, and cosmetology. She explained that the trainees in fashion design and garment making and ICT were trained for three months, while those for cosmetology spent one month. While calling on the state government to partner with the ITF by sponsoring more youths to acquire relevant skills, Coker said such had the capacity to alleviate poverty, settle youth restiveness and increase job and wealth creation in the economy. She said, “Governments all over the world have turned to skills acquisition, which is the universal currency of the 21st century, to arm their citizenry with skills for employability and growth. “With the number of Nigerians who are currently unemployed, the number of trainees that the ITF is empowering is like a drop of water in the ocean.
