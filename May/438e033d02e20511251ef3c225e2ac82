There was panic in the Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital on Tuesday when a policeman, ‘mistakenly’ fired three gunshots at his colleague. The incident, our correspondent gathered, happened as staff and visitors were entering the old Ebonyi State Government House in Abakaliki. It was gathered that the three gunshots sent fleeing in different directions. A source said those who were coming out from the Government House, ran back inside. The Ebonyi State Police Command confirmed the incident. The Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Aliyu Garba, said an officer accidentally shot one of his colleagues. Garba, who spoke on the telephone, said the wounded officer was responding to treatment in an undisclosed hospital. He said, “The officer who accidentally shot his colleague was servicing his gun, but accidentally released bullets from its chambers which hit the victim.” A police source said that the officer was immediately demobilised by other officers and taken into the command. The Special Assistant to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Francis Nwaze, in a statement, urged the citizens not to panic. “The incident occurred when some police officers were effecting maintenance services on the Armoured Personnel Carrier stationed in front of the old government house and the wounded officer is currently receiving treatment,” he added.
