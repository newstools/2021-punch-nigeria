Former boxer Jeremiah Okorodudu has advised British-born Nigerian world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, to ignore Tyson Fury and concentrate on training ahead of their potentially explosive clash. Joshua holds the IBF, WBA and WBO title and WBC titleholder Fury is in the final stages of agreeing to a fight to decide the undisputed champion. The Joshua vs Fury match-up will take place on August 14 in Saudi Arabia, if it gets finalised, according to Fury’s co-promotet Frank Warren. Fury has been inactive since he stopped Deontay Wilder to claim the WBC title February 2020, while Joshua is eager to return to action after defending his WBA, IBF and WBO belts with a knockout win over Kubrat Pulev in December. Okorodudu in a chat with The PUNCH said it would be better for Joshua to face his training with all seriousness. “What I have to say to Joshua is that he should concentrate on his training,” Okorodudu said. “He should train harder and become the unified champion. “I have followed the Joshua vs Fury fight for some time now and I believe that it is better that our boy (Joshua) allow Fury to talk while he does his thing. “I know that it’s better to talk less and do more.” Copyright PUNCH.
