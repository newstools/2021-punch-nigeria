Temilade Openiyi, professionally known as Tems , is undeniably one of Nigeria’s biggest breakthrough artistes this year as she is still breaking grounds into the global music industry. The Afro-beats singer and producer has been placed on the number one spot of the Billboard Next Big Sound chart today. The position, which is a projection for the third week of the month (starting from May 22), places her above the likes of Korean girl group ― Fromis 9 and Cherry Bullet ― Joshua Bassett, Blaqbonez, among others. Recently, digital billboards featuring Tems on the cover of Apple Music Africa Now were sighted in four cities in the United States ― Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, Miami and Lagos. Undeniably, her collaboration with Africa’s Starboy, Wizkid, on the song ‘Essence’, has caught the attention of international stars and audience towards the upcoming act. As earlier reported by The PUNCH, hip-hop legend and American rapper, Snoop Dogg, was seen on his Instagram live stream last month vibing to Essence, to the joy of many Nigerian fans. Reality TV star, and beauty industry empress, Kylie Jenner, also took to her Instagram stories last month to share a video of herself singing along to the lyrics of the song. While she lost the Headies award for the Next Rated artiste to Omah Lay in 2020, Tems is definitely one of the Nigerian music sensations to look out for this year.
