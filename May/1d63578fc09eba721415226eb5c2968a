BORNO State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum has returned to the state capital, Maiduguri,  after 21 days abroad on annual leave. The governor while away transmuted power to his deputy, Alhaji Usman Kadafur, who was in charge as the acting governor in line with the constitution. The greater part of the governor’s official leave  was spent on the lesser Hajj in Saudi Arabia where he busied himself praying for return of peace to his troubled state, which has been under  Boko Haram insurgency  for the past 12 years. The governor, who arrived the Maiduguri International Airport on Wednesday,  was  received by thousands of  jubilating residents who lined the highway from the airport to the Government House. As his convoy moved, the people shouted  “Baba Ayoyo,’  meaning, beloved father welcome back. The governor, who later addressed the crowd, commended them for their love, support and sacrifice. He said he prayed that almighty Allah answer all the prayers of the people for peace, unity and progress of Nigeria. .Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
