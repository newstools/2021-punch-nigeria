A former governor of Imo State and Senator representing Imo West, Rochas Okorocha, on Friday, responded to Governor Hope Uzodinma, dismissing the allegation that he refused to register as an All Progressives Congress member. He also said the APC stood no chance of winning a single ward in the state under Uzodinma’s watch. Okorocha, in a statement by his spokesperson, Sam Onwuemeodo, accused the governor of taking delight in dishing out propaganda against him. The ex-governor was responding to the governor’s claim that he (Okorocha) refused to register as a member of the ruling party. He said, “The media reported what the Imo State Governor, Chief Hope Uzodinma, told the APC’s appeal committee on the party’s registration and revalidation exercise – that Senator Okorocha refused to be registered as an APC member in Imo State during the exercise. “This claim could only be laughable to most Nigerians who still remember how APC came to Imo, and indeed, the South-East. Okorocha needed to revalidate his membership of APC and not to register as an APC member. Governor Uzodinma has always delighted in propaganda that doesn’t fly. “The registration and revalidation exercise didn’t take place anywhere in Imo. It was done at the Nick Banquet Hall at the Government House, Owerri. The governor’s appointees generated fictitious names at the local government level and took them to the Government House to be enrolled.” The ex-governor added, “The appeal panel should take note of what the governor told them, but should please ignore that, in the overall interest of the party. Beyond his claim, under Governor Uzodinma, there is no ward in Imo APC today that can be sure of winning in the event of an election.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
