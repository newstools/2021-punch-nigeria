The Supreme Court on Friday upheld an earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal which okayed the deregistration of National Unity Party and 73 others. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission last year deregistered the political parties over their inability to win any election during the 2019 general elections. In the judgment delivered by Justice Adamu Jauro, the Supreme Court, on Friday, said the deregistration of NUP, one of the 74 parties, was done in line with the laws and compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act. The judgment was delivered virtually. It was delivered by a five-man panel led by Justice Mary Odili. Justice Adamu Jauro delivered the lead judgment which was on the appeal filed by the NUP and others. The apex court said the deregistration of the parties was done in line with the laws and compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act. It said INEC was empowered by Section 225 (a) of the Constitution to de-register any political party that fails to meet the relevant requirements. The apex court then dismissed the partiesâ€™ appeal.
