Activist, Aisha Yesufu, has said that she will not link her National Identification Number to her phone number as required by the Federal Government. According to Yesufu, linking her NIN to her phone number will have her information in the control of a terrorist sympathiser and his cohorts. She disclosed this in a tweet with the hashtag #PantiMustGo which demands the sacking or resignation of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami. “Let me repeat categorically what I have said before. I WILL NOT BE LINKING MY NIN to my phone number! I will rather not have a phone line than willingly give my information and have it in the control of a terrorist sympathiser and his cohorts #PantamiMustGo,” Yesufu tweeted. The call for Pantami’s sacking or resignation is a result of a sermon he delivered in the past which had him allegedly sympathising with terrorist groups – Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Pantami was, however, backed by the Presidency through the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, who said the minister was young when he made those statements and that his position had since changed. Reacting through a video in April, Yesufu said, “The Presidency is not Garba Shehu and Muhammadu Buhari. The Presidency is an institution and that institution should never be seen in any way whatsoever supporting someone who is now known to have been a terrorist sympathiser.
