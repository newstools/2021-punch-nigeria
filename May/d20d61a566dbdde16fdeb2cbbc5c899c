VFD Group Plc, a proprietary investment company, has said it will pay N8.51 dividend per share to its shareholders for the 2020 financial year. It disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday, titled ‘VFD Group to pay out N8.51 per share as dividend for the year 2020’. The group also disclosed that its profit after tax grew by 170 per cent to N3.3bn. According to the statement, major highlights of the results showed that its gross earnings grew by 96 per cent to N6.65bn from N3.39bn; profit before tax grew year-on-year by 176 per cent; while trading and other non-interest income grew by 47 per cent to N4.66bn from N3.17bn. The statement said a 14 per cent year-on-year decline was recorded in credit losses and impairment despite the impact of COVID-19 on the Nigerian economy. It said its total asset grew by 85 per cent to N81.67bn from N44.23bn. The group said gross earnings performance was driven by significant growth in interest income, which grew by 90 per cent, while the PBT result was also supported by the business’s ability to keep cost growth lower than revenue growth as expenses grew by only 34 per cent. The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, VFD Group, Nonso Okpala, said, “2020 was a challenging year for the global economy with the onset of a pandemic that questioned every known business principle. “However, we weathered it and delivered our best financial performance so far. This was only made possible through the dedication of our staff and the support from our shareholders and other key business stakeholders.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
