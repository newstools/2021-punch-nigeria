Two sisters and a motorcyclist were on Monday crushed to death after a Mack truck ran over them in the Abak Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The incident occurred along the Ikot Abasi two-lane highway by Government Technical College. The PUNCH gathered that the two sisters, one of whom was identified as Catherine Abang, a student of Peace Institute of Management Technology, Abak, were returning to school from the market where they had gone to shop, when the accident occurred. A witness, Mr Mfoniso Okon, told our correspondent in Uyo on Monday that Miss Abang was accompanied to the market by her sister, who had attended her matriculation. He said, “Catherine Abang, an indigene of Ogoja, Cross River State, matriculated on Saturday May 8, 2021, with her biological sister, who came in from Cross River State to witness the matriculation at Peace Polytechnic, Abak. While returning to school from the market on a motorcycle after shopping for food items, they were both run over by a Mack truck and died at the spot.” The Dean of Students Affairs of the institute, Samuel Essien, described the news as heartbreaking. “The entire institution was overwhelmed and heartbroken to hear that Catherine Abang and her sister were involved in such a tragedy barely 48 hours after she pledged to make Peace Polytechnic proud,” Essien said. The Akwa Ibom Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Olufemi Olonisaye, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent in Uyo, said the crash occurred on Monday around 6.45pm. He said, “We lost three persons on a motorcycle in the crash. The motorcycle was trying to overtake a truck. Unfortunately, the motorcycle was crushed by another oncoming truck.” Copyright PUNCH.
