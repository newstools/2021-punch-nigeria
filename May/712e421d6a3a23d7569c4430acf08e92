A cryptocurrency ATM operator, Bitcoin Depot, has launched 355 new teller machines across the United States. This brings the total number of ATM locations supporting crypto-fiat exchange to over 19,000 globally. Bitcoin Depot runs a growing network of ATMs (crypto teller machines) in the U.S. It has installed over 2,500 crypto ATMS worldwide, with most in the U.S. These ATMS allow registered users with a wallet acquire cryptocurrency with their phone number enough for identity verification. President and CEO of Bitcoin Depot, Brandon Mintz, said, “Our kiosks allow them to essentially self-bank through the digital wallet on their phone, by turning their cash into cryptocurrency which can be used to transfer money, pay bills or invest.” There are over 19,300 crypto teller machines in 73 countries. The ATMs are operated by close to 600 companies. BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC are the most widely supported cryptocurrencies. Also, hundreds of banks in the U.S. will reportedly start offering access to bitcoin to their customers later this year. This is thanks to a partnership between fintech giant Fidelity National Information Services and the New York Digital Investment Group, the bitcoin investment arm of $10bn New York-based Stone Ridge. The FIS is a vendor to banks with nearly 300 million current accounts. This is not the first-time banks in the U.S will be offering bitcoin to their customers. Morgan Stanley announced in March that it will begin offering bitcoin funds to wealthy clients. Goldman Sachs said it would offer options to bitcoin investments to its clients. JPMorgan is allegedly considering a product in conjunction with NYDIG.

Doge’s surge this week can be linked to Elon Musk’s planned appearance on NBC’s ‘Saturday Night Live’. Musk is a fan of the coin, and it is likely he speaks about the currency on the national programme which would drive up its demand and price. Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013. It regained popularity with attention from billionaires like Musk and Mark Cuban. Dogecoin is a decentralised digital coin that facilitates peer-to-peer digital transactions. It allows one to send money online with ease. Unlike Bitcoin, there is no limit to the amount of Dogecoin that can be mined. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
