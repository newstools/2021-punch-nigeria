Yeni Anikulapo-Kuti, the oldest child of Afro-beat legend, Fela, has denied reports that her younger brother, Seun, insulted Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, at her 60th birthday on Monday. Yeni, who is also a co-host of ‘The View’ made the clarification on Twitter following a trending video showing Seun walking furiously away from the governor’s direction. Reports on Twitter stated that Seun showed the governor a ‘middle finger’ in the presence of his siblings. Yeni, however, tweeted “What happened was that the security detail in the course of doing their duty pushed his wife. He got upset at them understandably, not the governor. He even explained to the governor. I beg o! He has home training.”
