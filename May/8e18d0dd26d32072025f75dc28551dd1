and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth. “Our customer base also grew strongly for most of the year with new customer registration requirements in Nigeria stemming our onboarding of new customers in the final quarter, and these restrictions were lifted in second half of April.” The company’s operating profit increased by 24.2 per cent to $1.12bn in reported currency, and by 32.8 per cent in constant currency.

However, it witnessed slowdown in customer base growth due to new SIM registration regulations in Nigeria.
