The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, said the ongoing synchronisation of National Identification Number with SIM cards across the country will help the nation to easily identify people, including the crooks. He, therefore, urged Nigerians to fully participate in the exercise which he said will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy. Buhari spoke while inaugurating the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The President said proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database would provide an impetus for more effective planning and security oversight. “The NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks,’’ he said. The President said the inauguration of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card registration was timely and would support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy. “The National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,’’ he added.
