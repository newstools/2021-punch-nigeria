A principal officer of the Senate, who is representing Niger North Senatorial District, Senator Sabi Abdullahi, has raised the alarm that bandits being pursued out of Katsina and Zamfara states by security agencies, have started relocating to Niger State. The Deputy Whip of the Senate stated this on Saturday while commiserating with the Sarkin Sudan of Kontagora, Alhaji Saidu Namaska, over the brutal murder of his Son, Alhaji Bashar Namaska.by bandits. Abdullahi said the action of the bandits was sad and unfortunate. The Senator lamented that “Niger North had in the past few weeks become a  haven for the bandits from Katsina and Zamfara states and the area has been receiving increased onslaught.” He attributed the development to the aftermath of the operations of security agencies which has been pushing out the bandits from the neighbouring states of  Zamfara and Katsina to Niger. He, therefore, appealed for more integrated and comprehensive actions by the security agencies  to flush the criminals out of their communities that are rural in nature in Niger North. He said, “The attacks on senatorial district  have led to wanton destruction of property, worth millions of naira, with over 30,000 people rendered homeless. “Over 50, 000 villages had been  ravaged,” the Senator further lamented. The late Namaska was said to have  visited his father’s farm at Masuga village close to Kontagora town when he was killed by the bandits. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
