Director of  Dominican Vocation Support & Project Coordinator, Rev. Fr. Stephen Ogbe, has said the Dominican College, Yangoji, Abuja, will offer free education to out-of-school-children across the country through a scholarship trust fund. Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday, Ogbe said the construction of the world-class educational facilities was ongoing on a 15 hectares of land, adding that they sought financial assistances from well-meaning Nigerians to complete the project. He said, “The facility upon completion will provide a great succor for a number of out-of-school-children not only in the FCT, Abuja, but also across the length and breadth of the country. The capital-intensive project has progressed steadily with the kind generosity of good spirited individuals and corporate bodies. However, the sum of N250 million is still needed to get the school running fully. “ He added that it was important to create an avenue for the children of the elites and the indigents to thrive together in the same educational atmosphere. Ogbe revealed that the Dominican college planned to give scholarship to the children of the poor who could not afford education. “The indigent scholarship trust fund will take care of out-of-school-children whose parents are poor or they are orphans, it will cater for their needs 100 per cent throughout their stay in school. We need at least N100m for a start and the number which we will admit will be determined by how much Nigerians can support,” he said. He explained that the new session would start in September and admission is from JSS one. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
