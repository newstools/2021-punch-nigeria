There are indications that the Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress may cancel the results of the Surulere Local Government Area primary election, as well as those of Ikorodu and Badagry LGAs held on Saturday, over reports of violence in the areas. Surulere is the base of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. Recall that two persons were said to have died in the Surulere violence, while Badagry and Ikorodu were said to have recorded “high levels of violence.” Sources told our correspondent that apart from the violence, the party received complaints of doctoring of results, among others. One of the sources said, “That of Surulere is the worst. A powerful politician brought in hoodlums from neighbouring communities. The result is what we saw on Saturday. The state executive members are looking at the complaints, especially in the three council, their results will be cancelled.” The spokesperson for the party, Mr Seye Oladejo, did not pick his telephone when our tcorrespondent called him on Sunday. But earlier, Oladejo in a statement on Sunday, said the APC appealed to security agents to investigate the violence and prosecute the culprits. “We wish to admonish the security agencies to conduct thorough investigations to bring the culprits to book and maintain law and order. “We wish to reiterate that hoodlums, cultists and other outlaws are not members of our party and will not be tolerated,” the statement added.
