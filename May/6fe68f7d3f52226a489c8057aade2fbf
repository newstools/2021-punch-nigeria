The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said the resolutions reached by Southern governors which placed a ban on open grazing in their region offered no solution to the clashes between farmers and herders.

Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.”
