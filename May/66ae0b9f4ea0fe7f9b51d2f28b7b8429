Men of the Ogun State Police Command have shot dead two suspected armed robbers at the Sagamu interchange, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. Oyeyemi said the two suspects were shot dead following a distress call received by the Divisional Police Officer, Sagamu Division, CSP Okiki Agunbiade, around 9pm on Sunday. The PPRO said the police were informed that a robbery operation was going on at the Sagamu interchange and that one of the victims had been seriously injured. He stated, “Upon the distress call, the DPO quickly led his patrol team to the scene, where they met the robbers attacking one Agba Enoch. “The team engaged them in a gun duel at the end of which two members of the gang were fatally injured, while others escaped with gunshot injuries. “Items recovered from them are three mobile phones, one mock gun, one electric clipper, three ATM cards and one blood-stained cutlass. “The injured victim, one Adekunle Adewale, who had machete cuts on his head, was rushed to hospital for medical attention.” Oyeyemi added that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, commended the gallantry displayed by his men and ordered a massive manhunt for the fleeing members of the gang with a view to bringing them to justice. “He also appealed to members of the public, especially hospitals, to quickly alert the police if anybody with gunshot injuries show up in their facilities,” Oyeyemi stated.
