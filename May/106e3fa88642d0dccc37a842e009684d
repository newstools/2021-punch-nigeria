Fifty-one former Peoples Democratic Party councillors who served in various Local Government Areas, of Gombe State, on Thursday, dumped the opposition party to join the ruling All Progressives Congress. Spokesman for the group of former councillors, Joseph Kwati, said their decision was based on the outstanding performance of the Gombe State Governor, Mohammed Yahaya. The councillors, who were drawn from across the 11 local government areas of the state, were later issued with the APC membership cards after a short ceremony, at the Gombe State APC Secretariat. Kwati, a former Secretary of the Gombe Councillors’ Forum, said, “We dumped PDP when we c ompared the achievements of APC in two years. “We took the decision, no one either approached us or solicited our crossover; we were convinced and wished to join in moving the state ahead.” Receiving the new party members, the state APC Vice Chairman, Ado Gabani, who spoke in a similar vein said, “Our new members were convinced by Governor Inuwa’s achievements and decided to join us. Let me add that they have all been issued membership cards.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
