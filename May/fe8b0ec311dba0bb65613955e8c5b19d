THE House of Representatives has approved a bill seeking each division of the Court of Appeal to have a minimum of six justices per time for effective justice delivery. The amendment will consequently raise the number of justices from the current 90 to a minimum of 150. At the plenary on Tuesday, the House passed for second reading the Court of Appeal Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill, sponsored by the Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, Mr Onofiok Luke. The legislation is titled, ‘A Bill to Amend the Court of Appeal Act, Cap. C36, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to increase the number of Justices of the Court and Provide for Appointment of a minimum of six Justices in every Judicial Division of the Court for speedy and efficient justice delivery and to improve citizens’ access to justice.’ Luke said, “The law perches the maximum number of justices of the court at 90. This number has become inadequate, given the recent creation of the new divisions of the court – Kano, Gombe, Awka, Asaba, etc. “There is a high increase in the volumes of cases attended to by the court, which of course has necessitated the creation of the new divisions. This implies increased workload with fewer hands, which therefore affects quick justice dispensation at the appellate level.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
