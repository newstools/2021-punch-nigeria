Edo State Government has kicked off COVID-19 vaccination campaign for private and public school teachers across the 18 local government areas of the state ahead of Monday school reopening. The Edo State COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr Andrew Obi, disclosed this while addressing journalists on Saturday in Benin, explaining that the exercise was part of efforts by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to contain the pandemic and ensure the health and safety of citizens. Obi said the vaccination for the teachers, which commenced on Saturday, would end on May 14, 2021, when the state would round off the first phase of its vaccination. Obi urged residents to be part of the first phase of vaccination and get inoculated against the deadly virus. He said vaccination was ongoing at locations, including the premises of the Edo State Ministry of Health, the Hospitals Management Board, Central Hospital, Immigration Office and the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, as well as other mobile posts. He said, “Edo State Government has commenced the vaccination of all teachers in the state ahead of school resumption for Monday (today). With the campaign, the government will ensure the compulsory vaccination of all teachers as frontline workers against COVID-19.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
