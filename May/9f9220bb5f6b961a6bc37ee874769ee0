The Ovie of Arhavwarien Kingdom in the Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, Solomon Akporhiere Onajeta, Okukenren III, has raised the alarm over the high rate at which water hyacinth is taking over the Arhavwarien River in the area. The Arhavwarien River is the main access link between the island kingdom and other towns and villages in the state via boats as there is no link bridge. The monarch expressed dismay over the water hyacinth invasion, making access to his kingdom more difficult, adding that it was preventing easy navigation by his subjects. Onajeta urged the state government and relevant agencies to come to the area and help remove the water hyacinth from the river before it would cause accidents. This, he said, would also allow for free access into the community. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
