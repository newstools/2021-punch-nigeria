The Executive Director of the Regulatory and Corporate Affairs of 9mobile, Abdulrahman Ado, has advised the youth to cultivate the habit of reading good books. Ado stated this while marking this year’s World Book and Copyright Day. Ado also said the World Book and Copyright Day presented an opportunity to celebrate Nigerian authors, inspire youths to read more, as well as pen down their own thoughts through writing and publishing. He said, “The importance of books cannot be overemphasized. Books are valuable assets that stimulate innovation and national development. My word of advice is; pick up a book today and read. While at it, also consider writing your own.” Ado noted that reading is therapeutic and helpful in tackling the boredom that comes from staying indoors. In marking this year’s event, 9mobile partnered Zikoko, a digital media platform which tests the knowledge of participants on how well they remember the books they read growing up. Copyright PUNCH.
