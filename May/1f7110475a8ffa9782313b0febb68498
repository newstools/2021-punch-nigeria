Chapel Hill Denham says it has become a signatory to the UN-supported Principles of Responsible Investment. The company said it had joined a global network of nearly 4000 signatories representing over $100tn in assets under management who are committed to incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance measures into their investment decision-making and practices. The Chief Executive Officer, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr Bolaji Balogun, said in a statement, “Simply put, Chapel Hill Denham joined the Principles of Responsible Investment because it reflects how we invest and have operated our firm from day one. “Our focus on advocating for ESG measures and using sustainability as a key piece of our investment process and operations, ensures the companies we work with adopt a longer term, sustainable approach.” According to him, joining the other signatories to the PRI is an affirmation of our commitment to responsible impact investing. “As a leading active asset manager in the region with a long-term bias, it is our responsibility to help individuals and institutions build a financially sound future, while playing a positive role in the development of capital markets and encouraging strong corporate governance,” a partner at Chapel Hill Denham, Phil Southwell, said. The CEO, PRI, Fiona Reynolds, was quoted as saying, “In joining PRI, Chapel Hill Denham is recognizing the importance of ESG factors to its clients, and demonstrating a commitment to sustainable investing in Nigeria and Africa broadly. We are pleased to welcome Chapel Hill Denham as a PRI signatory, and look forward to working with the team.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
