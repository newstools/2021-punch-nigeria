Huawei, a leading information and communication brand, has said that over 270 million Africans lack access to mobile internet because of lack of access. In a statement, titled “Bridging the gap: Why we should never give up on universal broadband connectivity”, signed by the President, Huawei Southern African Region, Leo Chen, he expressed a great need for a major look at the telecommunications sector of developing countries. Chen said a critical examination of the telecommunication gaps, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa was pertinent. He called on African countries to embrace universal broadband connectivity, especially in this period when digital transformation was at an unprecedented rate in other societies around the world.
