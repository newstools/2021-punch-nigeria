Up-and-coming singer, Olajide Daniel, popularly called Don-Dan, says it has been quite challenging for him to get public attention because music producers prefer working with known artistes. In an interview with Saturday Beats, Daniel said, “As an up-and-coming artiste, one faces a lot of challenges such as finding it difficult to reach out to already known artistes and getting DJs to play one’s songs in the clubs. Another challenge is getting to work with famous producers. Some producers see up-andcoming artistes as a means of making money. They ask for huge amounts of money to produce just one song, not considering that one is still struggling to make a name for oneself.” The singer, however, noted that those hiccups would not discourage him from pursuing his dreams. He said, “All I need now is 100 per cent focus on my music.  Music by young Nigerian artistes is recognised all over the world. Young artistes are doing quality and amazing things and that is earning the industry more respect internationally. I just want to give my fans and every music lover out there good music. I want to churn out music that people can listen to from one generation to another. My songs are laced with good messages, not music that is all about girls, money, or fraud.” Copyright PUNCH.
