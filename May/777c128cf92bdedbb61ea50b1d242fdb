Former Super Eagles winger, George Finidi, has stated in clear terms that the Nigerian Professional Football League will not thrive unless it is run as a business, The PUNCH reports. The NPFL has been without a sponsor for four years – a move the former Ajax and Real Betis winger said has not helped the league. Speaking during an interview session on PUNCH Online TV programme, Kick & Follow, Finidi said the NPFL had not evolved in over three decades. “I think it will be difficult (to succeed) because we don’t run football as a business,” Finidi said. “Though in my own time, we had companies that had football teams, unlike what it is today, where most of them are run by the government. “Those days we had multinationals who owned football clubs but most of them have pulled out now. “It’s more than 30 years now; the NPFL should have been more developed than it is now. It should have gone past this level. “By now we should have good pitches, sponsorship deals and TV rights correctly, but that’s not the case. These are some of the things we need to address urgently. “Like it’s done in Europe, the government does not interfere in football matters because they don’t fund them. They have funds from other places and until NFF/LMC gets that sorted out things will always remain the same. Someday, I hope we get it right.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
