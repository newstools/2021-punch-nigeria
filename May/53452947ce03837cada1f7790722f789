The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has extolled the leadership role of Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, in tackling the party’s internal crisis in the North Central and for contributing to the party’s development in the country in general. In the commendation letter signed by the National Secretary, Senator Umaru Tsauri, the PDP appreciated the governor for restoring peace to the chapters of the party in Nasarawa, Plateau and Niger states. “This letter is to commend His Excellency for your role and leadership in the North Central Zone, which led to the resolution of disagreements and the forging of a virile party in Niger, Plateau, and Nasarawa states. “We also appreciate your contributions that resulted in the peaceful and successful hosting of the North Central Zonal Congress,” Tsauri said in the letter. The PDP in Niger, Plateau and Nasarawa states had internal disputes until Ortom, as the party leader in the North Central zone, waded in, a move that brightened the chances of the party ahead of the 2023 elections.” In addition, the governor recently hosted a meeting of the North Central PDP, which further fixed cracks in the party within the region.
