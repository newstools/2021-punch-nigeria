The Kogi State Police Command has confirmed the release of the state chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, Alhaji Wakili Damina, who was abducted last week. The state Police Commissioner, Ayuba Ede, made the confirmation on Sunday in a WhatsApp chat with our correspondent in Lokoja “He’s been released. I’ve spoken to him on phone but did not give details of his absence. He promised to reach out to me soon, ” the CP told our correspondent. The state secretary of the association, Adamu Abubakar told newsmen in Lokoja that Damina was released in Abuja late Saturday night. Adamu said from Damina’s account, he was released by men suspected to be from one of the security agencies and not kidnappers as earlier suspected. He said that Damina arrived at his Chikara home in the Kogi Local Government Area of the state in the early hours of Saturday to reunite with his family. Adamu had announced to newsmen in Lokoja on May 4 that Daminas was taken away by eight men dressed in military camouflage in a white bus, adding that all efforts to get across to him proved abortive as his telephone lines were switched off. However, the secretary said that the national body of the association had taken the matter up to ascertain why Damina was whisked away in such a manner. He also said that the group had instructed a lawyer to take up the matter. Adamu then expressed the gratitude of the association to the state government, police, media and members of the public for their support and concern during the period.
