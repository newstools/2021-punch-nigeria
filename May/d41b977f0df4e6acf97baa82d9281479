Some former Super Eagles players say Paul Onuachu has what it takes to succeed in any league across Europe, The PUNCH reports. The Genk striker recently emerged the highest goal scorer in Belgium’s topflight and was also named the Jupiler Pro League Professional Footballer of the Year. Onuachu scored 33 goals and provided five assists for Genk in 38 league appearances to pick the Golden Shoe Award. Speaking with our correspondent on Tuesday, former Eagles midfielder Mutiu Adepoju, backed the gangling striker to continue where he stopped in Belgium, if he was prized away from Genk by the bigger European sides. “He can perform as long as he finds a club that can play to his capacity. Definitely, he is a great player and he will score goals anywhere across Europe. “Any club that would buy him would have seen him play and would know he would be able to blend to their philosophy. All he needs is to keep playing and get used to what the club wants,” Adepoju told The PUNCH. Former Tanzania coach Emmanuel Amuneke added, “Of course he has the qualities to play in any league but he has to do that under a coach who values him and can play to his strength.” Ex-Eagles assistant coach, Sylvanus Okpala, also backed Onuachu to excel anywhere in Europe, after his  feat in Belgium. “Why can’t he perform? People go from Nigeria to Europe to play for the first time and they do well, he will definitely do well since he has shown that he is good enough,” Okpala told The PUNCH. Copyright PUNCH.
