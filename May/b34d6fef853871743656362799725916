The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has assured Nigerians that the country is in safe hands despite the security challenges it is facing. He advised citizens not to succumb to doomsday predictions about Nigeria because they won’t come to pass. The Minister said this when he received the Oluyin of Iyin-Ekiti, Oba Adeola Adeniyi Ajakaiye and his entourage at his office in Abuja on Thursday. “Talking about security, I want to use this opportunity to assure all Nigerians that despite the security challenges we are facing now, Nigeria is in safe hands. We must never succumb to the apocalyptic or doomsday predictions about our country because they won’t come to pass. “It is also important for our leaders at all levels to give the people message of hope instead of making comments that can only aggravate tension,” the Minister was quoted in a statement on the ministry’s website.
