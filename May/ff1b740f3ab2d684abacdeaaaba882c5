The Kano State governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, has directed filling station owners in the state to acquire firefighting equipment or face prosecution. This was contained in a statement by Ameen Yassar, the Director General, Media and Public Relations, Government House, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH on Tuesday in Kano. Ganduje gave the order when he visited the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano to see victims of a recent tanker fire incident. Recall that no fewer than 68 persons sustained varying degrees of burns as a result of the fire, which broke out at the Al-Ihsan Filling Petroleum Company, Sharada. A tanker was offloading fuel on Saturday when the incident happened. The governor directed the state fire service to prosecute owners of filling stations with no functional firefighting equipment. He also directed the agency to reprimand filling stations with faulty fire equipment, stressing that his administration would not allow fuel to be sold under hazardous circumstances. “The state fire service must undertake routine inspections of filling stations to ensure that they comply with all standard safety measures so as not to endanger lives and property,” he added.
