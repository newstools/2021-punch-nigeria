Eighty-six freight trains have recently arrived in Nigeria, according to a statement released on Friday by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Ltd. The statement revealed that the 86 freight trains will be used on standard gauge railways in different parts of Nigeria. “Recently, the first batch of 86 freight trains arrived in Nigeria. They will be used on standard gauge railways like the Abuja-Kaduna Railway, Itakpe-Warri Railway, and Lagos-Ibadan Railway. “This will also be our first time undertaking Port-Railway intermodal transport during the trial operation of the Lagos-Ibadan railway,” the statement partly read. According to the statement, the 86 freight trains were only transported under six days, rather than the estimated 30 days to arrive in the country. “In order to carry out the Port-Railway intermodal transport successfully, CCECC Nigeria and its partners made joint efforts to complete the transport of the 86 freight trains in only 6 days, which was 24 days shorter than the estimated 30 days, significantly reducing the time and ensuring transport safety.”
