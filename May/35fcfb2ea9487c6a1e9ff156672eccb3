THE National Broadcasting Commission has suspended the licence of Human Rights Radio 101.1FM which airs the Brekete Family programme hosted by Ahmed Isa, aka Ordinary President. The NBC said in a statement on Thursday that the suspension will take effect from May 31, 2021 and will last for 30 days. The suspension comes barely weeks after Isah was caught on video slapping a woman during an interview. The woman was accused of setting the head of her niece on fire. The commission said in a statement titled, ‘NBC sanctions Human Rights Radio for recurring unprofessional conduct’ that it held a meeting with Isah to give him an opportunity to defend himself. The statement read in part, “The commission has, therefore, in line with the sanction provisions in 15.5.2 of the Broadcasting Code, ordered the suspension of the licence of the broadcaster until the broadcaster commits to ethical and professional broadcasting. The suspension order is effective Monday May 31, 2021 at 12am.” The commission said the radio station would pay a fee as provided for in Section 15.5.1 of the Broadcasting Code at the end of the suspension.
