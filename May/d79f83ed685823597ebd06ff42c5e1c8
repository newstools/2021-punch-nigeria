A couple identified as Ekene and Rose Ijokun have allegedly killed their two-week-old baby during a fight that ensued between them at their house in Eleyowo village, in the Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the couple engaged each other in a hot argument, which degenerated to a fight. Rose was said to have strapped the baby to her back while her husband was allegedly assaulting her. The traditional ruler of Eleyowo community, Chief Eso Ojo, who confirmed the incident, described it as sad and unfortunate. He said, “We have never had such a case in our community before. Many times, there have been reports on the couple’s incessant quarrels and it is very unfortunate it ended this way.” According to a source, the union had been fraught with quarrels. The source said, “The baby was strapped to the back of Rose when she and her husband, Ekene, started the verbal attack on each other, before it led to physical attack. Initially, people thought it was their usual way of abusing each other after which they settled. “But this time, it was the other way round as the disagreement degenerated into a physical combat which eventually claimed the life of their baby. “The baby was hale and hearty before the incident. Later, the baby was removed from the mother’s back and placed on the bed. It was then he was no longer breathing.” Efforts to revive the baby reportedly proved abortive, as he was confirmed dead at a health centre in the community. The traditional ruler stated that the case had been taken over by the Ondo State Police Command for further investigation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
