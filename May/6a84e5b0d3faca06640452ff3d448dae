The National Inland Waterways Authority has expressed grief over the boat mishap that occurred in Munyan Local Government Area, Niger State. The agency in a statement on Wednesday said that night sailing was outlawed. It was reported that 28 people lost their lives in the accident. The Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, Ahmed Inga, confirmed this in a statement. He said the occupants of the boat were 100 passengers from Tija village, Munya Local Government Area of the state. Inga said the incident happened 50 metres to their destination when the boat hit the stump of a tree and broke. He said 65 people survived, 28 corpses recovered by local divers while seven people were still missing. The director-general said search and rescue operation was still ongoing to recover the missing persons. The management of NIWA commiserated with the government and people of Niger State, and in particular, the families of those that lost their loved ones in the boat mishap that occurred. According to a statement signed by the Managing Director/CEO of NIWA, Dr George Moghalu, the authority said it was particularly pained by the unwarranted loss of lives and property due to disregard for established rules and regulations guiding passenger ferry operations in the country. “For safety reasons, night sailing is banned; the use of life jackets and other life-saving appliances are mandatory, even as over-loading of boats is a criminal offence. Yet boat skippers and crew are fond of flouting these rules.” He added that NIWA would continue to engage in aggressive enlightenment and education of ferry operators and passengers. Copyright PUNCH.
