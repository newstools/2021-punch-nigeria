Singer, Chinagorom Onuoha, better known as Africa China, has said it is important for entertainers to have other means of income, especially because of the paucity of shows due to social distancing guidelines occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. He added, “It is very important to have a side hustle. It will get to a point when one would need to get something done, but because shows are not holding, one would not be able to get those things done. In addition, it is not good to keep one’s family waiting over something they think one can handle.” African China is also of the opinion that the Federal Government had not been able to handle the rising spate of insecurity in the country because of insincerity on the part of the authorities. In an interview with Saturday Beats, the ‘Crises’ singer said, “I feel insecurity is something the Federal Government can handle but because they are not sincere with themselves and the people, the situation appears unsolvable. Our leaders need to show the people that they are in office to serve them. Change can only come when they do the right thing.” Sharing his thoughts on the transformation that has taken place in the Nigerian music industry, the ‘Mr President’ singer said, “Music production has improved. It is on another level now and I must commend this generation for that. However lyrically, some are good while others are not.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
