Former Minister of Information, Edwin Clark, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to address Nigerians concerning the role of his regime in solving the increasing insecurity in Nigeria. The elder statesman made this call on Sunday during an interview on Channels Television, monitored by The PUNCH. According to Clark, the ruling All Progressives Congress and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party cannot fix the insecurity issues in the country. He said, “Let President (Muhammadu Buhari) call all of us. APC cannot do it alone, PDP will not either. Call the leaders, there are all generals in this place, General Gown, General Babangida, and all of them. “Abdusalam is there talking every time. Nigeria does not lack people. Let the President come out to see his people. Let him invite his people and discuss with them, what do we do with our country?” he questioned. The former minister confirmed his support for the restructuring of the nation and the creation of state police. He, however, said that she states may be unable to pay police personnel to tackle insecurity in the country. These remarks from the elder statesman come a few days after southern governors agreed on restructuring, open grazing ban, and calling the president to address Nigerians.
