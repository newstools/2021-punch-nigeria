The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission has declared Gimba Yau Kumo, son-in-law to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), wanted for alleged $65 million fraud. Kumo, a former Managing Director, Federal Mortgage Bank, got married to Buhari’s daughter in October 2016 in Daura, Katsina State. The commission in a notice published on its website said Kumo was wanted alongside Tarry Rufus and Bola Ogunsola over alleged misappropriation and dispersion of national housing fund. The notice was signed by the ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Azuka Ogugua. It read, “The persons whose pictures appear above, Mr Tarry Rufus, Mr Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of $65m. “Anyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters, Abuja, any of the ICPC State Offices or the nearest police station.” Kumo’s tenure at FMBN was characterised by allegations of corruption. He and three others allegedly paid themselves outrageous severance packages at the end of their tenure in October 2014. In April, the senate committee on public accounts summoned Kumo to explain the alleged irregular award of N3 billion contract when he was still at the bank.
