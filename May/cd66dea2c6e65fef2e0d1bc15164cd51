In its efforts to take the sport to the grassroots, the Lagos State Judo Association has concluded plans to take the sport to schools. LSJA chairman Sheriff Hammed said it was  part of the new board’s plan to popularise the sport in the state, with the aim of attracting young people to the sport. “This is actually a journey because the new board wants to ensure we take judo to schools across the five divisions of Lagos State and educate the students on the rudiments of the sport,” Hammed said. “For us, grassroots remains the bedrock of sports development and with the support we have been enjoying from Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu through the Lagos State Sports Commission, our focus is to grow the sport as there are more talents that abound in Lagos.” He added, “As chairman of the new board, this is how we want to revive the sport in Lagos State. We will organise a lot of competitions for schools in the state and hope that we can identify talents from the tournaments.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
