Less than 48-hours after he was kidnapped, President of the Ijaw Youths Council worldwide, Peter Igbifa has regained his freedom. Igbifa was abducted by armed marksmen along the Port Harcourt International Road in Rivers State on his way to catch a flight to Abuja for a crucial meeting. An aide to the Bayelsa State Governor and Director, New Media, Kola Oredipe confirmed his release in a telephone chat with our correspondent on Wednesday night. Oredipe further said Igbiga was dropped off in a community in Bayelsa by his abductors and rescued by the police afterwards, adding that he was taken to Governor Douye Diri after he breathed the air of freedom. “He was dropped off in one of the communities in Bayelsa. Thereafter, the police rescued him. He was taken to the Governor. So he is in Yenagoa for now,” Oredipe stated. There has been widespread unrest among youths in the Niger Delta since the news of his abduction near Port Harcourt.
