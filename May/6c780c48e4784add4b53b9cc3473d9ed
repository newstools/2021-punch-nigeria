The Edo State Skills Development Agency in partnership with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH Skills Development for Youth Employment programme has hosted experts to train job seekers on how to surmount the hurdles of the labour market in the world of remote work. This was made known in a statement released on Wednesday by the office of Special Adviser, Media Affairs, Edo State. The virtual summit which was held on Wednesday provided job seekers with the opportunities to engage with recruiters. Speaking at the event, Managing Director, EdoJobs, Ukinebo Dare, emphasised the three most-asked interview questions, which seek to test a job seeker’s competence; willingness, attitude and patience. The Chief Executive Officer, Temploy Nigeria, Junyin Benson, also noted that job seekers needed to identify temporary employment opportunities in the era of remote work which would help in contributing to economic growth in the state. Also, Head, Youth Engagement and Learning, Jobberman, Nigeria, Mrs Precious Ajoonu, reiterated the imperative of having standard curriculum vitae to scale the hurdles of the Applicant Tracking System, noting that such would help them in landing decent jobs.
