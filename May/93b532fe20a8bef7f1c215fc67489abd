Biffo Abdulahi, head coach of the title-chasing Kwara United, says their defeat to Nasarawa United will not have an adverse effect on their title ambition, as they hope to immediately bounce back from the loss. The Afonja Warriors suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Lafia City Stadium as the second stanza of the NPFL 2020/21 season resumes over the weekend and now sit third on the log with Akwa United the new league leaders. Speaking with The PUNCH, Biffo admitted that the loss was only a temporary setback on their title ambition, but added that the team was still on course to fulfilling their dream of winning the league this season. “The defeat to Nasarawa United is not a major blow to our title chase but a temporary setback,” Biffo told The PUNCH. “Nasarawa are one of the best, we came here and they gave us a good fight and we lost. We gave our best but I think the red card we got changed the game. “Any team from eighth position to the top still have a chance to win the league. So, we just have to double our efforts to ensure that we claim the first position back.” Kwara United will next take on Plateau United, who are 10th on the log, in Week 21 as they hope to bounce back from their defeat.
