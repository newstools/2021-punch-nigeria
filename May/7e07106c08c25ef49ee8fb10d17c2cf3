Fast-rising para-badminton teenage star, Eniola Bolaji, has revealed that the thoughts of her late coach Bello Oyebanji inspired her to victory at the 2021 Spanish Para-Badminton International competition in Cartagena, Spain, The PUNCH reports. Oyebanji died in a ghastly auto crash along Oyo/Ogbomosho expressway in April, on his way to secure his visa for the Spanish tourney. One month after Oyebanji’s death, his athlete, Bolaji, made history becoming the first African to win gold at a para-badminton international championship. She came from a set down to defeat Ukraine’s Oksana Kozyna 18-21, 21-14, 21-18 in the final. With the victory, she has also qualified for the World Para-Badminton Championship in Japan in October. “I’m very happy to have won the championship and also being the first African to achieve this feat,” Bolaji told The PUNCH. “But it was tough for me prior to the tournament in Spain. I went through a lot of difficulties when coach Oyebanji passed on in April. His death is the inspiration behind my success story today. “My late coach, who sadly passed away in April, will always be my biggest inspiration.” The 19-year-old also revealed that she capitalised on Kozyna’s weakness to win the final. “I played her prior to the quarter-finals and lost 2-1, but I noticed few weaknesses and capitalised on them when we met in the final. “I’m hopeful of winning another gold medal in Japan in October.” Copyright PUNCH.
