CHAIRMAN of the Osun Progressives, Mr. Lowo Adebiyi, on Wednesday, expressed fears over the future of the All Progressives Congress in the state. Adebiyi, who led the Osun State chapter of the then ruling Action Congress of Nigeria, was on Tuesday suspended by the Elders’ Caucus of the APC over his relationship with the new group. Featuring on a radio programme, ‘Frank Talk,’ monitored in Osogbo, Adebiyi said he was not given fair hearing by the Elders’ Caucus before his suspension. He said, “The point I am making is that at the next Congress of the party, let us have democratically elected executives. Even if it is going to be consensus, let the aspirants sit and agree. “Not that someone will sit in his sitting room and say this is going to be your chairman. The government is almost three years and we have over one year ahead of us. Our concern is the Congress of the party. TOP is not about the governorship. But we believe we need formidable hands to run the party. “The motion passed by the Igbimo agba (Elders’ Caucus) endorsing him (Oyetola) for second terms, what are the plan? Are we just endorsing without a plan? Responding to issues raised by Adebiyi, Secretary, Elders’ Caucus of Osun APC, Mr. Akin Omolaoye, said the splinter group headed by the ex-acting chairman, was an aberration that could not be tolerated by the caucus. Omolaoye said, “The existence of Ilerioluwa, Oranmiyan, The Osun Progressives (TOP) and any other group is an aberration. A group is used to press in the interest of a given individual that is not physically known but he is agitating to become something. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
