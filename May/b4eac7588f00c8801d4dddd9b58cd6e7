Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, says some of the gunmen responsible for the premeditated ambush and murders of security personnel in the state have been apprehended and will face the full wrath of the law. The governor also announced the relaxation of the curfew in Obio-Akpor and Port Harcourt local government areas as well as Port Harcourt International Airport from 8.30pm to 6am beginning from Sunday. Wike, in a state broadcast, said measures the state government had undertaken so far to check the recent intermittent breaks to the state’s security by the predetermined attacks on security checkpoints and the resultant killing of some security personnel had yielded positive results. The governor’s address was contained in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, and made available to journalists on Saturday. “Thank heavens, those responsible for the premeditated ambushes and murders of security personnel in the state have been apprehended and are now facing the bitter venom of our laws as none that is proven to be criminally liable will escape the fury and crushing impact of justice,” he said.
