The Independent National Electoral Commission in the North-East region has commenced efforts to review and validate a 2022-2026 strategic plan of action ahead of the 2023 general elections. The Gombe State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Umar Ibrahim, disclosed this at an event in the state to review and validate the 2022-2026 strategic programme of action of the commission, which had five other RECs in attendance. Ibrahim said the document would provide an actionable blueprint expected to guide all activities of the commission in the next four years. He said, “The activities include preparations and conduct of the 2023 general elections as well as all off-season governorship elections.” According to him, the strategic plan and programme of action, when adopted, will take over from the 2017-2021 plan, which is going to expire by the end of 2021. He stressed that the collective contributions of stakeholders across the North-East region would be critical to the success of the objective of the plan. Ibrahim added, “The field officers must as a matter of fact be vigilant, following the security challenges of the region, which is capable of affecting the smooth discharge of their assignments.” Copyright PUNCH.
