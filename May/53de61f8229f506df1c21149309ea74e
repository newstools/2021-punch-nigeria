Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said no amount of intimidation or attacks will make the state succumb to any secessionist agenda. Wike, who presided over an emergency meeting of the State Security Council at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on Saturday, condemned the attacks by unidentified gunmen on some police formations on Friday night. The governor in a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, expressed condolence to the families of the slain policemen. The statement was titled, ‘Rivers can’t succumb to secessionist agenda.’ “On behalf of the Government of Rivers State, I wish to offer our heartfelt condolences and express our deep sadness in the wake of these horrific attacks,” he said. Wike urged the people of Rivers State to be calm, saying the security council had taken measures to secure the state. He enjoined them to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement of persons to security agents for prompt action. Gunmen had on Friday opened fire on a checkpoint in the state, then drove to two police stations, killing officers and burning patrol cars. Seven policemen were reportedly killed while the police killed two of the attackers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
