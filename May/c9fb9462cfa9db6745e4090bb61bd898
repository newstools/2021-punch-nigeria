Thousands of protesters have marched to the Israeli embassy in London to seek immediate action by the government to end the brutal violence against Palestinians in the Gaza conflict. The Gaza conflict has forced thousands of Palestinians to run from their homes due to the loss of lives and property. The PUNCH had earlier reported that President Recep Erdogan of Turkey called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to show solidarity with Palestinians following the latest attacks by Israel on Jerusalem and Gaza. In solidarity, thousands have taken to the streets of London to chant “free Palestine” in protest against the Gaza conflict. These protesters descended on Hyde Park near Marble Arch to begin a March at midday on Saturday. According to DailyMail, the protesters could be seen scaling buildings, climbing gates, and clambering to the top of traffic lights outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington, London. The organisers revealed that demonstrators were estimated at 150,000 in number, making it the biggest pro-Palestine demonstration since 2014. The Gaza conflict has swallowed the lives of about 126 people, including 31 children and 20 women as a result of the tank fire air strikes, and hundreds of rocket fired between the Isrealis and Palestinian militant group.
