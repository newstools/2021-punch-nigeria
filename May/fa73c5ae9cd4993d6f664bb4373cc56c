The rumours are over and it is official. Neymar is staying at Paris Saint-Germain, where he believes he can win the Champions League. The Brazilian has a contract extension which ties him to the Parisian club until 2025 and he is hungry for more success. “Of course, my goal when I came to Paris Saint-Germain, was to help get Paris Saint-Germain to the top, among the very best, and we are getting close,” Neymar told PSG’s official website. “We are gaining more and more experience to help us negotiate these types of games, to know how to play in the Champions League, and PSG are on the right track. “We are getting closer and closer to the taste of winning the Champions League, I’m sure we can do it.” Neymar also spoke of his commitment to the club and desire to win more trophies, but it is clear that the Champions League is the key ambition for him personally, for the club and for the owners. “I’m very happy, very happy to be extending my contract with PSG until 2025,” said Neymar. “The truth is that I’m very happy to be staying here for four more years, to be a part of the club’s project, to try and win titles, to try and achieve our biggest dream which is the Champions League. “So I’m happy to be staying at the club, to be a part of it and to be extending my contract.” The Brazilian forward insists that he is content in Paris and that is the main reason he wants to stay, while also wanting to continue to contribute to the history of a club that has changed a lot in recent years. “I have changed a lot, I have learned a lot,” he said. “Things have happened that should not have happened. We had fights, a few sad times, but overall the evolution has been very positive.”
