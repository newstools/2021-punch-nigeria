The National Information Technology Development Agency, on Thursday, launched its four-year Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan starting from 2021. It said in line with the National Digital Economic Policy and Strategy, the plan was designed to guide NITDA’s initiatives, especially towards achieving the agency’s new vision of “proactively facilitate the development of Nigeria into a sustainable digital economy.” The Director-General, Kashifu Abdullahi, during the agency’s 20th anniversary lecture in Abuja, said the plan would establish a new strategy for NITDA based on the aspirations of the government, current realities, and future expectations. He added that the plan would contribute to the implementation of NDEPS and facilitate the digital transformation of Nigeria. He said, “The objectives of the strategy are to articulate a new strategy for NITDA in accordance with the current aspirations of the government, the realities of today and the demands of the future; to contribute its quota towards the implementation of NDEPS. “We are talking about digitalising everything we do, and we have started the implementation; we are working on digitalising the agric sector, the education sector, the banking sector, digitalising almost everything. “So, this strategy is going to help in coming up with new ideas on how to disrupt the conventional way of doing things and digitalise everything in Nigeria.” The plan features seven pillars, namely development regulation, digital literacy and skills, digital transformation, digital innovation and entrepreneurship, cybersecurity, emerging technologies, and promotion of indigenous content.
