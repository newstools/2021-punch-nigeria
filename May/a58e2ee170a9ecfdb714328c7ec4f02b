The Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, has inaugurated ‘Operation Restore Peace’ in Rivers State to address the issue of insecurity in the South-South region. This was contained in a statement released on Wednesday by the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, titled, ‘IGP moves to re-order security in the South-South, launches “Operation restore peace” in Port-harcourt’. This comes barely 24 hours after the IGP launched the operation in Enugu, to curb the issue of insecurity in the South-East. Baba noted that the operation in the South-South region is targeted at “stemming the tide of violent attacks and breakdown of law and order, and contain the heightened threats to lives and property occasioned by the secessionists activities of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network and other criminal elements in the region.” The IGP also condemned the increased cases of violence, economic sabotage, and other activities threatening security in the region. According to him, this new special operation action plan will re-order and stabilize security in the South-South region. He urged citizens in the South-South region to give full support to security personnel throughout the period of the operation and beyond.
