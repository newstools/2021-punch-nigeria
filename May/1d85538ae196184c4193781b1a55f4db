A team of Nigerian Breweries non-alcoholic beverage brand, Maltina, has distributed food and branded items to Muslim faithful in Lagos Island. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the brand said the act of kindness began on May 3 and ran till the end of the Ramadan and Eid el Fitr festivities. It added that the brand distributed praying mats, digital tasbihs, and tote bags to the Muslim faithful just before their evening prayer as part of its sharing campaign. Speaking on the event, Senior Brand Manager, Elohor Olumide-Awe, said, “What we are doing is very much in line with our brand essence of sharing happiness. “Ramadan is a time of giving and sacrifice and Maltina believes the act of sharing is very important even more so than the magnitude of what is shared. “Therefore, we are encouraging all our consumers to share no matter how little.” Also commenting at the event, Category & Channels Manager, Ehimhen Igberaese, said, “This campaign is not limited to Lagos only; we are also connecting with Muslim faithful and those in need across various locations – Abuja, Benue, Plateau, Niger, Sokoto, Kaduna, Ibadan, Kogi, Kwara, and other states nationwide.” The Muslim faithfuls present at the Olorunshola Workers Jamar mosque expressed gratitude to the entire Maltina team for their kindness and generosity, the statement added.
