Hundreds of Itsekiri people on Friday stormed the Zone 5 Police Command in Benin, Edo State, protesting the continued police intervention in the crisis rocking the Olu of Warri stool. The protesters requested the police to allow the chiefs to go back to Warri and resolve the issues amicably. Bearing several placards, the protesters said the police intervention in the matter was a slight on the custom and tradition of the Itsekiri people. One of the protesters’ leaders, David Iwere, said, “We are here as Itsekiri and we are tired of the media coverage the issue has generated. What is happening in Itsekiri has never happened before. We are here to appeal to the Assistant-Inspector General of Police to send all the chiefs home and give them time to come back and report the efforts that have been made to settle the matter.” Also speaking, Mrs Okhere Amaju said, “As a group, we are calling for peace. We are tired of the crisis, we have come to appeal to the police to allow the chiefs to take the matter back home and settle it. “We can settle the issue ourselves. Itsekiri issue is not for the police. We are a people with culture and tradition. We need to go and resolve our issues at home. We need peace in Itsekiri.” In his response, the Zone 5 Police Public Relations Officer, Tijani Momoh, said the demonstrators’ request would be conveyed to the AIG and whatever directive he gave would be communicated to them. The crisis started after the death of the former Olu of Warri, which led to the disappearance of the 400-year-old crown. In a twist last week, the key of the room housing the crown was found.
