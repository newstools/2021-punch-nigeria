The state Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Ini Ememobong, stated this while briefing newsmen on the new development in Uyo, the state capital He said, “The report made critical findings and recommendations and council deliberated on the report and accepted the recommendations and directed that the visitation panel immediately take steps to ensure that the closure of Akwa Ibom State University is brought to an end and that the institution be opened up for academic activities” However, the Chairman of the institution’s ASUU, Dr Ime Okop said academic exercise would only take place when lecturers started receiving alerts He said the gates of the institutions which had been shut would be thrown open, but nothing would happen until all the conditions that necessitated the strike wre met. “I am aware that they met; but it’s only when government meets the conditions that we will resume. We’re waiting for the order to be implemented, the moment it’s implemented, we will call off the strike,” Okop said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
