According to Spanish newspaper, La Voz de Almeria, Sadiq may be heading to Italy after Atalanta identified the Almeria striker as a possible reinforcement for next season. “As LA VOZ and Cadena SER have learned, Atalanta has pointed out the name of Umar Sadiq as a possible reinforcement for next season, so the destination of the Almería player could be the Italian Calcio, where curiously the Nigerian footballer has a good poster, since Italy knows the Rojiblanco scorer,” the website stated. “The young UD Almería player is very focused on the last four days left to finish the regular phase in the Second Division. Then will come the Play Off for promotion to the First Division, where Almería hopes to be third in line with a fit Umar Sadiq and offering his best version to score goals that take UD Almería to the highest category of national football, the dream of Turki.” The 24-year-old is having a fantastic season at Almeria, having scored a total of 26 goals in 49 matches across all competitions and is in contention for the Pichichi award in the Spanish second tier with 18 goals, a tally only bettered by Espanyol’s Raul de Tomas (24) and Sporting Gijon’s Uros Durdevic (21).
