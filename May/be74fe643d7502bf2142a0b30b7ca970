The regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), marked six years on Saturday and Nigerians have expressed their displeasure concerning the administration. Though the President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, shared some of the achievements of the president in the last six years, Nigerian tweeps still posited that they were not impressed by the current government. A tweep, @freemandayly said, “Buhari has destabilised our economy and no government is capable of bringing our economy back to normal.” Another tweep, @bashiogu, said, “With the facts we all have, it is already clear that the Buhari administration is a failure!” “He has done nothing since he became Nigeria’s president. As a matter of fact, nothing has changed! Rather, the situations in the country have escalated,” @polymathda tweeted. @maxibaba007 tweeted, “May Nigeria not experience anything called Buhari again.” For @okeynwoko, the present administration has “brought nothing but hunger, tears, sorrow and regrets to most Nigerians.” Describing the current regime as a failed government, @Uk4rel8 tweeted, “I’ve never seen this kind of desperation by a government to portray before its citizens that they are successful and progressive, while all the indicators of a progressive and successful nation are pointing downwards. We’re simply at rock bottom amongst nations.” @jabuajah tweeted, “Nobody wishes Buhari and his government even for their enemies! This government is a nightmare, hoping to wake up from its dread now.” “Nigerians are suffering a lot! Nigerians will only remember how they are dying in hunger, poverty, and insecurity. There is no good future for our younger generation,” @sabozuwo tweeted.
