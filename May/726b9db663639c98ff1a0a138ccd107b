Four people were killed on Thursday in a multiple fatal crash at Wailo village, along Bauchi-Darazo highway in Bauchi State. The Bauchi State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Yusuf Abdullahi, told Saturday PUNCH that four other people sustained varying degrees of injury in the crash that involved eight male adults. Abdullahi explained that the multiple accident, which occurred on Thursday, May 27, at 2.45pm, was caused by speed violation and wrongful overtaking. He noted that FRSC personnel responded within 30 minutes and arrived at the scene of the crash for a rescue operation. The sector commander said, “The crash involved a commercial vehicle, a Toyota Matrix with number plate BEN256TA belonging to the National Union of Road Transport Workers. The second vehicle is a private Volkswagen Golf with number plate MUB739QW. We were called and our men rushed to the scene for a rescue operation. “They evacuated them to the General Hospital Darazo for medical attention. It was at the hospital that a medical doctor certified four of them dead. Their corpses have been deposited at the mortuary in the same hospital after which they will be released to their families for burial.” The FRSC boss said the injured were responding to medical treatment and advised motorists to obey road traffic regulations to reduce accidents and be mindful that speed kills.
