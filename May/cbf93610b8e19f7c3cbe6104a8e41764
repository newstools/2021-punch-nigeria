Some family members of late Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, have described him as a patient person and core gentleman. Attahiru’s elder brother, Alhaji Sani Musa, 85, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria at the late COAS’ family house in Kaduna, on Saturday, said the deceased was always there for the family. “Right from his childhood, he was a hardworking, honest person. Though l left for Bauchi when Ibrahim was in primary school, we kept in touch up till the time God took his life,” Musa said. Another family member, Ibrahim Musa, 83, said the late COAS loved his family and was always patient with them “no matter how you hurt him,” adding, “It was hard for him to be angry. Rather, he would call your attention and tell you what he believed was right.”
