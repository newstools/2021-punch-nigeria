Gunmen on Saturday night torched the Izombe Divisional Police Headquarters located in the Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State. The latest attack came just 24 hours after fleeing hoodlums razed a police station, Magistrate and High Courts, and vandalised a health centre in Atta community in the Njaba Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent gathered that the bandits met strong resistance in Izombe, leading to a gun duel. Though they succeeded in setting it ablaze, four of the invaders were killed, according to the police spokesperson in the state, Bala Elkana. Elkana, in a statement, said, “On 29th May, 2021, between 1900 hours and 2200 hours, some hoodlums in their number launched an offensive on Izombe Police Station but were repelled by the gallant policemen on duty. Four hoodlums were neutralised during the attack while others escaped with bullet wounds. “The Commissioner of Police, Imo State, CP Abutu Yaro, commended the men for their abiding faith in defence of the public space and urged them to be resilient in this fight until the enemies of the people are totally defeated. “Meanwhile, a mop-up operation is ongoing with a view of arresting other fleeing members of the gang.”
