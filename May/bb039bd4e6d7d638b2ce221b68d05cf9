The Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State says it has shifted primaries for its councillorship aspirants to May 28. This is to enable the party to conclude the screening of candidates ahead of the July 24 local government elections. The PDP Chairman in Lagos, Adedeji Doherty, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Lagos on Monday that the primaries, earlier scheduled for May 25, would now hold three days later. “We have moved it a bit forward. Most likely it is going to happen on Thursday or Friday. We have opted to move it forward because we have quite a lot of responses from the aspirants for the councillorship seats. “We didn’t think we were going to have that many aspirants, but we have quite a lot. So, our screening procedure has been extended,” Mr Doherty said. On the chairmanship primaries earlier slated for May 28, the PDP boss said that the party was still looking at it. He added that the party would field candidates in all the chairmanship and councillorship seats across the 20 Local Government Areas and 37 Local Council Development Areas of the state. NAN reports that Lagos PDP had fixed May 25 for congresses/councillorship primaries, while appeals arising from the congresses would be heard on May 26. May 28 has been scheduled for local government congresses/chairmanship primaries, while appeals arising from the congresses would be heard on May 29, before the submission of names of PDP candidates to the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission on May 31.
