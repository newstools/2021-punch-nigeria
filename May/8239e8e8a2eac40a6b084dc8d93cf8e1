Linkage Assurance Plc says it has unveiled its new brand identity as part of its growth strategy. It said in a statement on Wednesday, titled ‘Linkage Assurance Plc unveils new brand identity to strengthen its objective’, that since its inception in 1991, the company had constantly evolved to meet the ever-changing demand of the industry. The change in the company’s logo embodied a new blue, red, and orange, it stated. It said the inspiration behind the transformation was to reflect the new core values of the company, and to restate the qualities of trust, innovation, excellence, sincerity, and reliability that the company is recognised for. Commenting on the new brand identity, the Chief Executive Officer, Linkage Assurance Plc, Mr Daniel Braie, stated that the new logo and recapitalisation efforts of the company presented its aspiration as “Bigger, bolder and better” to offer exceptional insurance protection to individuals and businesses in Nigeria. He said, “Even though our logo is changing, what is not changing is our purpose and dedication to delivering on our promises to our stakeholders. “To us here at Linkage Assurance Plc, this goes beyond a logo change. Our new identity is one of many parts of our transformation process and it helps to strengthen our purpose. “It is a reflection of where we are heading, through our commitment to protect our policyholders, reinforce our legacy of trust while also capturing the spirit of the dynamic future we see ahead of us.” Braie said that the new logo with its crisp, clean feel, captured Linkage’s dynamism and excellence while bringing a sense of rejuvenation and growth in the company.
