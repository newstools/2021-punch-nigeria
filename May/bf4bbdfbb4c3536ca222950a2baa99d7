Friends and family members of a Nigerian Air Force pilot, Flt Lt Taiwo Olufemi Asaniyi, are grief-stricken at the moment as the young officer, who was about to wed, died when a Beachcraft 350 aircraft crashed at the Kaduna International Airport on Friday. Asaniyi was the pilot of the ill-fated jet which also claimed the lives of his co-pilot, Flt Lt Alfred Ayodeji Olufade, newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and eight others. Friends and associates of Asaniyi have since taken to the social media to mourn the youth. A tweep, @_victor_kings, wrote, “Flight lieutenant T.O Asaniyi. He flew the plane, we had his introduction in March. I was going to be his best man.” “Ahhh, no now, not Mr Asaniyi. Still saw his WhatsApp status update this week. Dear Lord!” @blessnoyiz expressed shock. “May their soul rest in peace. My condolences,” @bcube234 tweeted.
