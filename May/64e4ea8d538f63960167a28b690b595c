THE Archbishop of Ibadan Province of the African Church, Most Rev. Augustine Odufuwa, has advised the Federal Government to address Nigeria’s worsening economic crisis. Odufuwa said suicide, mental illness and depression had been on the increase as a result of the poor economy. The archbishop said this in his charge titled, ‘Come, let us arise and build,’ at the third biennial congress of the church in Ibadan. He also urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to stop influx of foreign herdsmen who he said were mostly carrying out killings, kidnapping, rape and armed robbery in the country. He said, “Inflation rate is very alarming today in our country; a loaf of bread which used to be N20 years back, is now N200. The cost of a bag of cement is scary. Fuel per liter is on the high side. “We have reports of high numbers of suicide, insanity and depression because of the poor state of our economy. Let Government set up a think tank to alleviate the sufferings of the masses.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
