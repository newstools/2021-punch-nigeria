A former Vice Chancellor of the Lagos State University, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, on Thursday, said the challenges facing Nigeria’s educational institutions were enormous. Fagbohun said this while delivering a lecture titled, ‘Leadership and Management of Educational Institutions: The Issues, Challenges and Solutions,’ at the Distinguished Personality Lecture Series, organised by the Lagos State Public Service Staff Development Centre, Magodo. The former VC, however, said there were several creative ways to tackle the challenges, adding that education institutions must step out of their confines and position themselves to be part of the solutions to the constraints that had held back the progress of the country. “The sector, as an entity, should seek the input of all stakeholders in charting a way forward for itself. It must also seek to leverage on its local talents, scale up its activities and create value for all relevant stakeholders,” he said. The Lagos Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, said it was not enough to identify the problems affecting the educational, there must be suggested solutions. Director General of PSSDC, Dr. Olufunmi Ajose-Harrison, said the distinguished Personality Lecture Series was conceptualized by PSSDC to impact the society. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
