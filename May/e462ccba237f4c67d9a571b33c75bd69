A former Chief Executive Officer, Lagos State Law Enforcement Training Institute, and a chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressive Congress in the forthcoming local council election, Prince Adewale Ojora, has promised to restore the lost glory of Lagos Island Local Council. Ojora, who spoke at a stakeholders’ rally, said he would protect the interests and businesses of residents of the council. He also assured the electorate of his commitment to returning and securing the future of one of the most prosperous cities in Nigeria, according to a statement on Friday titled ‘Ojora vows to restore the glory of Lagos Island Local Council’. The statement read in part, “Prince Ojora’s dreams for Lagos Island Local Council are encapsulated in his manifesto, where he highlights his seven-point agenda specifically aimed at reviving the infrastructural decay in Lagos Island and improving the socio-eco-political situation of his constituents. “His economic growth agenda, which would in turn flow into other sectors of the society, is centered on establishing strategic collaborations with stakeholders in the private sector.” Copyright PUNCH.
