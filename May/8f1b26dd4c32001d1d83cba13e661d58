The Senator representing Osun West, Adelere Oriolowo, has said it was almost too late to start Governor Adegboyega Oyetola’s 2022 re-election campaign. Oriolowo, said this while speaking at the maiden retreat for the All Progressives Congress Forum of Publicity Secretaries, in Iwo, on Saturday. According to him, the new amendment to the Electoral Act being considered by the National Assembly, has made it mandatory for parties to conclude their primaries early and have their candidates before the end of the year. He then declared that issues that must be resolved for the party to have a good outing were being addressed by him and other leaders. The federal lawmaker said, “Anybody that says starting a campaign for the re-election of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is too early is ignorant. If the electoral amendment that is currently being worked upon by the National Assembly is passed, by November, we must have had our candidate. “Every party must have had their candidates, that election is close, the campaign is even getting late by my thinking. We should have started addressing rancour in the party, but everything necessary for our campaign are things some of us are doing now.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
