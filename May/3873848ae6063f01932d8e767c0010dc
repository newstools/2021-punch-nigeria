Two suspects have been arrested after gunmen attacked St.Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church, Malumfashi on Thursday. During the attack, a priest, Reverend father Alphonsus Bello, died and another one, Reverend father Joe Keke, abducted. It was learnt that the gunmen invaded the church compound around 11 pm and headed for the residences of the two priests located inside the compound. Bello, who was said to be in his 30s, was reported to have initially resisted attempts by the gunmen to abduct him but he was overpowered. His remains were later found by the police inside farmland behind the Catechetical Training School Malumfashi early Friday morning. The whereabouts of Keke is still unknown as of Friday afternoon. The spokesman for the Katsina police command, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident and the arrest of two suspects in connection with the incident. He said, “The incident is true and we are doing all we could to ensure that Reverend father Keke is rescued alive. “As for the other priest Reverend father Bello, our men found the corpse and there was no sign of gunshots on him. He could have died of Axyphesation or shock. “We have arrested two suspects in connection with the incident because the gunmen after entering the large compound, went straight to the residences of the two priests. The Commissioner of Police has directed the Area Commander, Malumfashi to mobilise all resources in the area to ensure that Reverend father Keke is rescued alive.”
