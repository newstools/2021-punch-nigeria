In a speech titled ‘Community-based organisation: Issues and implications for rural biodiversity’, the Director-General, NCF, Dr Muhtari Aminu-Kanu said the people of Gashaka deserved recognition, applause and commendation for jealously guarding and protecting the national park in their area and making sure that the organisms there were still intact. He lauded the support of the Emir of Gashaka Kingdom, Alhaji Zubairu Hamman Gabbo, and called for continuous recognition of the efforts of the community towards the preservation of the park. He said, “It is their culture, motivation and works that have led to the endurance of biodiversity in the park, and I can see that confidently coming from Kano, which is an urban area, we have degraded our own biodiversity.
