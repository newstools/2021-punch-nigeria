Mr Adeyemi Adekola, the father of a four-month-old boy, Abel, has appealed to well-meaning Nigerians to help raise fund for his son suffering atrial septal defect, also known as ‘hole in the heart.’ Adekola, in an interview with our correspondent, said Abel was born with the condition on January 15, 2021. “Since then, we’ve been to several hospitals, including the General Hospital, Gbagada, and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja. We are currently at the Babcock University Teaching Hospital, Ilishan Remo, Ogun State, where he has been receiving treatment for over a week now. “The doctors there said he will be treated for an infection before any surgery can be performed on him. We were told to bring N5.5m for the surgery, out of which we have deposited N500,000,” he said. The sales representative with one of the microfinance banks in Lagos said life had not been easy since the birth of Abel, adding that he and his wife had spent almost all their savings on the birth defect. Abel’s mother, Yetunde, can be reached on her mobile number, 08160752443; while donations can be made into the father’s account number; 0115015606 – Guarantee Bank – Account name – Adeyemi Adekola.
