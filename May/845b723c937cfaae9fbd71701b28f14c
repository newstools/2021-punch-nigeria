The Lagos State Police Command says the Directorate of Public Prosecution, Lagos State Ministry of Justice, stalled the possibility of releasing Olanrewaju James, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, on bail. The police spokesperson, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, who made this known, said DPP insisted that the actor has criminal charges to answer to. “Invariably sexual assault is more like defilement too, considering the age of the victim. “So, Baba Ijesha is being kept with the police not within our own power, but because of the legal advice from the DPP pending when Baba Ijesha’s case will be charged to court. “If the DPP had advised us to release Baba Ijesha, we would have released him,” the spokesperson said. Adejobi explained that Baba Ijesha’s offence – indecent assault – was initially bailable until further investigation established a case of sexual assault by penetration. “However, after the DPP investigated the case file, the police advised not to release Baba Ijesha on bail pending when he will be charged to court. “The DPP said that there are a number of cases Baba Ijesha will be charged for, particularly sexual assault by penetration, which is a serious offense,” he added. Baba Ijesha, was arrested on April 22 for allegedly defiling a minor. Adejobi had said in a statement that preliminary findings revealed that the suspect started assaulting the victim sexually since she was seven years old. There was an uproar following a report that a directive had been given for the release of the Nollywood actor from custody. The report was that the suspect could be released as he could not be detained indefinitely due to the ongoing strike by members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria. Also, actor Yomi Fabiyi, held a protest to demand the release of Baba Ijesha, saying that his offence is bailable.
