Green Africa Airways Limited has announced the launch of its new route networks ahead of the commencement of operations. The airline, in a statement on Tuesday, said the operations would commence from its Lagos base, the General Aviation Terminal. Green Africa Airways said it was at the advanced stages of completing its Air Operators’ Certificate with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. According to the statement, it is ready to commence operations once it is done with the process. The airline recently received its first aircraft, ATR72-600, while the second and third aircraft were expected to arrive soon. The founder and Chief Executive Officer of Green Africa, Babawande Afolabi, said, “Starting with our launch route network, we are crafting a network plan that will afford more customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends. “Our three key product offerings – gSaver, gClassic TM and gFlex TM – will afford customers the value of choice and flexibility.” According to the airline, the launch of the route networks will foster trade activities and facilitate increased economic growth within Nigeria. It said the new direct connections from the commercial hub of Lagos would be into the cities of Akure, Ilorin, Abuja, Enugu, Owerri, and Port Harcourt. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
