West Africa’s verification and fact-checking platform, Dubawa, has concluded plans to induct 26 fellows into its 2021 cohort of fact-checkers to combat misinformation in the sub-region. Dubawa announced the commencement of its third batch of the yearly fellowship in Abuja. The third batch, which is the 2021 fellowship, named Kwame Karikari Fact-Checking and Research Fellowship, in honour of Ghanaian Professor, Kwame Karikari, is supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. Dubawa Programme Manager, Adedeji Adekunle, said 26 successful applicants, drawn from over 200 applications in Nigeria, Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone would undergo training that would equip them in combating the widespread regime of misinformation in the West African sub-region. He said, “Upon completion and evidence of competence after a 10-course module, the participants will graduate into the six months in-country fellowship.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
