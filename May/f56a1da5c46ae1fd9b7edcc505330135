The defection of the Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress has evoked mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media. The Governor on Thursday announced his decision after a closed-door meeting with six APC governors that lasted over an hour at the executive chamber of the Governor’s office in Calabar. His decision erupted various reactions from Nigerian tweeps; while few lauded him, some slammed him while others were indifferent. A tweep, @Omojuwa, wrote, “I guess Ben Ayade and Nyesom Wike couldn’t mend their differences. Ben Ayade has now transferred himself to the APC.” Another tweep, @GodwinEguono described the decision as a shameful one, as he tweeted, “They run to APC for safety when their tenure is coming to an end, to avoid being probed by EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission).” “What blessing will your decamping bring to the state? What development has Buhari brought to Nigeria that you want to join hands with him? What blessings has APC as a party brought to Nigeria?”, @TimothyFadayomi questioned. A user with the handle @Favoured_g tweeted, “Honestly, I’m not surprised. I’ve never seen him as a PDP person.His only aim and objective there is to use them to win the election.” @Valntynno tweeted, “2023 permutation I guess. Nigerians don’t care the party you belong to, good governance is all they want.” @kingdavide1 described both APC and PDP as the same thing. @geehussy1 tweeted, “This is the beginning of his political downfall.” @Johannxs, however, tweeted, “An interesting entrant to the APC. Welcome Governor Ben Ayade.”
