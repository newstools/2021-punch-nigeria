The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has denied claims that recovered loot was paid into his account. He also challenged whoever has evidence of such payment to present it publicly. Malami disclosed this in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr Umar Gwandu. The statement reads partly, “The Federal Government has a designated account at the Central Bank of Nigeria for all recovered assets. “Abubakar Malami, as a person or as the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, does not in any way receive any funds from the recovered assets. “Malami therefore challenge any person who has any evidence of such payments to either him or his office to come out publicly with proof. “Prior to the repatriation of all the recovered assets, Nigeria and relevant nations have signed Memorandum of Understanding as to what the monies will be put to and the government has been working in compliance with all the provisions of multi-national agreements reached. “It was on the basis of the application of the said funds in line with the agreements that Nigeria earns reputation among international committee of nations which translated into further recoveries.”
