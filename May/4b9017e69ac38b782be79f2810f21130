The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has suspended the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Hadiza Bala-Usman, sources familiar with the development said on Thursday. It was learnt that a panel of enquiry had been constituted to look into the matter that prompted her suspension, as well as other concerns. The panel begins its work on Monday. It was, however, not clear what necessitated the suspension of the NPA boss, who was only reappointed in January this year by Buhari. Senior staff members of the Federal Ministry of Transportation, the parent ministry of the authority, confirmed the development but insisted that there was no official statement on the matter yet. Spokesperson of the ministry, Eric Ojiekwe, could not be reached for comments on the development, as he did not answer calls when contacted on Thursday night. Bala-Usman was first appointed as the managing director of the NPA in 2016 and was reappointed in January this year for another five years. On Wednesday, the suspended NPA boss led her organisation to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Bureau of Statistics and the Nigerian Ports Authority to commence the production of statistical information and data analytics on port related activities..
