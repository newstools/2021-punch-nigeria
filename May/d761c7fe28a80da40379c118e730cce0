Ericsson ConsumerLab has said 5G is changing smartphone users’ behaviour globally and they spend more time with cloud gaming and AR. The company revealed in a report that more 5G users were turning off the Wi-Fi on their phones after upgrading. The report said, “Indoor coverage is one of the focus areas to emerge from the consumer research, with one-in-five 5G users already reducing Wi-Fi use on their phones indoors because of the benefits of 5G mobile connectivity.” There are 220 million 5G subscribers globally. The report reveals that by the end of 2020, increased awareness of service and value benefits might result in increased 5G subscriptions, globally. However, while 5G users are satisfied with speed, most are dissatisfied with the availability if innovative service and new apps. The reports said, “COVID-19 lockdowns and movement restrictions mean that the vast majority of 5G early adopters’ regular experiences with the technology have been indoors. “As a result, early adopters indicate that indoor coverage is two times more important than speed or battery life in delivering satisfactory 5G experiences.” Copyright PUNCH.
