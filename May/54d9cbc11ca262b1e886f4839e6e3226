A hospital owner in Plateau State, Bitrus Musa, who was kidnapped by gunmen, has regained his freedom. Also, a nursing mother identified only as Paulina, has been released after hoodlums abducted her while leaving her baby behind. The two victims were abducted separately on Tuesday in Furaka and Eto Baba communities in the Jos North Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that Musa, who is the proprietor of G-Medicals at the Tina Junction suburb, regained his freedom on Wednesday. He was reportedly kidnapped while trying to enter his house in the neighbouring Furaka community. A few hours after his abduction, the gunmen contacted his family and demanded N10m ransom. Our correspondent, however, could not establish whether any ransom was paid before he was released. A resident of Eto Baba, Sandra Joseph, where the nursing mother, Paulina, was kidnapped said, “We thank God she is alive. They just released her a few hours ago.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Ubah Ogaba, confirmed the release of the hospital owner. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
