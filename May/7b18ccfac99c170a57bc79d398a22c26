Pastor of the Household of God Church International Ministries in the Oregun area of Lagos State, Reverend Chris Okotie, says Nigeria will experience rebirth after a major crisis rocks the country. He also said there was the need to change the 1999 Constitution and restructure the country along the line of fiscal federalism. The cleric stated this in a statement titled, ‘Major Crisis Imminent, Okotie Warns’. The statement partly read, “Nigeria is at the cusp of a major crisis which is a precursor to its rebirth. “Pristine forces which have been a perennial impediment to the fulfilment of Nigeria’s prophetic destiny are about to be pulverized.” Okotie also called for more proactive measures against the spread of violence in the country. The cleric “identified the parlous state of the economy, corruption and endemic poverty as the root causes of the nation’s security crisis”. He “supports the calls for restructuring as one of the key solutions to the problems of nationalities, inequality and ethnic divisions that inhibit national cohesion. According to him, “the battle between centripetal and centrifugal forces would continue to fuel instability, unless the constitution is changed to reflect national diversity”.
