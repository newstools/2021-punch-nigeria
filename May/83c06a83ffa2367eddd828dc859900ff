Six persons have been reported dead as India experiences a cyclone hit. This year’s cyclone named ‘Cyclone Tauktae’ by the Indians has been preceded by high tidal waves and windy downpours in the coastal belt of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa in India. Due to the heavy rains and gusty winds in Goa, power supply has been disrupted in majority of the areas. Goa Power Minister, Nilesh Cabral, reveals that the power disruption is due to the hundreds of electric poles that were uprooted due to the high-speed winds. As Cyclone Tauktae heads northwards to Gujarat, six people have been reported dead, hundreds of houses have been damaged, and electricity poles uprooted, according to News18. Fifty-four teams of National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force have been deployed in Gujarat to handle the rising situation. According to the India Meteorological Department, Tauktae which has taken the form of a “very severe cyclonic storm” is likely to intensify further during the next 24 hours and reach the Gujarat coast on Monday evening. The state of Maharashtra is also getting ready for the cyclonic impact as the IMD also predicted heavy to very heavy rains by Monday. This situation comes at a time where India is experiencing an upsurge in the spread of COVID-19. Over 274,000 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in India since the pandemic began.
