The Chairman, Mutual Benefits Assurance, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, has declared interest in securing the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party for 2022 Osun governorship election. Ogunbiyi, who spoke in Ileaogbo, at the Ayedire local government meeting of the PDP on Sunday, said in a video of the event obtained by The PUNCH on Monday, that members should shun greed and work towards returning the party to government. The businessman, who spoke in Yoruba language,  said, “I asked them, what do we do? Have you a preferred candidate? They said that as many as possible can seek the party’s ticket.   “I asked them what will be my fate, and they asked if I am interested in vying for the ticket again and I told them I am interested. This is my home and I am telling you now; that I am interested in becoming next Osun State governor. “I urge you to work for the party and work for Akin Ogunbiyi. I am happy for this level of acceptance. Let us work very hard and return to government. If we win, we will all benefit.  Let us shun greed and vote without being induced.” Ogunbiyi had contested the PDP ticket for the 2018 governorship poll, but lost the primaries to Senator Ademola Adeleke.
