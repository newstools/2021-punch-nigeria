The Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State has described the arrest of Abidemi Rufai, a Senior Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun as an embarrassment. The Chairman of the PDP in the state, Sikitullah Ogundele, said this while speaking with The PUNCH on Tuesday . Ogundele said the arrest of Rufai showed that people of questionable character are in the political system. He, however, absolved the governor over the arrest of his aide, saying efforts must be on to weed out people of questionable character from politics. He said, “People of questionable character should be kept away from our system. “It is unfortunate that the governor of Ogun State has chosen somebody of questionable character and it is an embarrassment to the entire state. “It is not the fault of the person that appointed him but personalities must be well vetted before giving them appointments. “It is quite unfortunate that the guy got arrested in America and I know that things are coming up, people of questionable character will soon be brought to open. It is an unfortunate situation.” Rufai was arrested on Friday in the United States for employment fraud involving over $350,000. He risks up to 30 years in jail if found guilty.
