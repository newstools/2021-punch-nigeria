A Policeman lost his life in a fight with a civilian for eating during the Ramadan fast. A resident of the area, Abdullahi Damba informed The Punch that, the policeman was eating bread during the Ramadan fast when one Alage Muktari looked at him in an unpleasant manner. “Abdullahi said, “The policeman bought a loaf of bread with soft drinks and began to eat and  Muktari, who was in the shop looked at him in a particular way.” “The policeman was irritated and queried Muktari to explain to him why he was looking at him that way.” According to Abdullahi, the policeman removed his belt and began to beat Muktari and in an effort to defend himself, Muktari hit the policeman very hard which led to his death. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, said, “The suspected murderer has been arrested and will soon be charged to court.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
