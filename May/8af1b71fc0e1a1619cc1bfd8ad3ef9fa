The Imo State Police Command on Friday asked residents of the state to ignore the sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra on May 30. The command, in a statement by its spokesperson, Bala Elkana, said it was ready to deal with members of the group. It urged IPOB fighters to sign their wills before May 30 as the command was ready to decisively deal with them. The statement read, “The attention of the Imo State Police Command has been drawn to some messages circulating on social media purported to have emanated from leaders of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra directing innocent and law-abiding citizens of the state to sit at home from May 29-31, 2021. “The command wishes to inform the good people of Imo State that adequate security arrangements are in place to guarantee their safety. The police in collaboration with other security agencies in the state has massively deployed its resources and Special Forces to provide watertight security across the state. “To those who are bent on disturbing the peace of the state, we have this simple message for you: steer clear of the public space or write your will before you step out. The command is battle-ready to deal decisively with hoodlums and criminal elements in line with the law.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
