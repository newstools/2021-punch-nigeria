FIRST Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, on Wednesday dismissed the allegation that the Indigenous People of Biafra was planning to attack Lagos as a malicious propaganda. Speaking at a press conference at his Ukpor hometown in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, the 92-year-old statesman said no sane Igbo man would ever think of such. Describing Lagos as the cradle of Igbo civilisation, Amechi described the allegation as false. He further described the relationship between the South-East and South-West as filial and bonding, adding that those behind the propaganda were only trying to cause division. Amechi recalled that in 1966, the Western Region Governor, Col Adekunle Fajuyi, sacrificed his life for the sake of then Head of State, General Aguiyi Ironsi, as well as intervention of then Eastern Region Premier, Dr. Michael Okpara, during the travail of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo while in Calabar prison.  He added, “Let me seize this opportunity to dispel a cheap and blatant falsehood which some ignoramuses are spreading in the social media that IPOB and or some organisations and persons are planning to burn or do damage to some places or properties in Lagos. “This is a cheap and idiotic falsehood. Igbo properties in Lagos are so many, so scattered and so high in value for any Igbo group or organisation to think of destroying. While condemning the Senate President, Ahmed Lawal, for vilifying Southern governors over restructuring, he enjoined Southerners not to allow anybody to divide them. . Copyright PUNCH.
