BARELY eight hours after leaders of Tiv and Fulani agreed to work for peace and end the renewed killings, five persons were reportedly murdered by herders at Ukoo Abaa village near Kufai Amadu in Takum Local Government Area. Though the Taraba State Police Public Relations Officer, David Misal, said he was not aware of the killings, local residents insisted five persons were killed on Sunday. One of the residents, Mr. Paul Yade, told our correspondent on the phone that five persons were macheted to death at Ukoo Abaa village near the Taraba/Benue border. “My uncle’s wife was attacked and robbed of all the money on her, while her daughter who tried to protest was cut several times with cutlass. She is receiving treatment at MDG hospital in Amadu. “The attackers in their numbers killed five persons and proceeded to the neighbouring Benue State. Meanwhile, stakeholders of Tiv and Fulani on Saturday signed agreement in Jalingo to end the killings and pave the way for the displaced people to return to their homes. In a communiqué signed by Sarkin Fulani Bali, Alhaji Adamu Abacha, and Zaki David Gbaa, Ter Bali II and Chairman, Taraba State Tiv Traditional Leaders Council, the groups condemned the attacks and called for a ceasefire.
