Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has said that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not a religious one. Omokri made this statement on Wednesday, stressing that the ongoing conflict between both countries is territorial, not religious. According to him, outsiders have made the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a religious war and it shouldn’t be so. “Outsiders shouldn’t make the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a religious war. It is not. It is a territorial war,” he said. He also pointed out that support for either of the parties should not be based on religion. He said, “There are Israeli Arabs and Christians, and Palestinian Christians and Druzes. Don’t support one side or the other based on religion. Rather, support peace.” This comment comes at a time where the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which began over a week ago, is rapidly escalating. Palestinian militant group Hamas, launched rockets attacks on Israel last week to retaliate against clashes that the Israeli police had with Palestinians Since the start of the attack, up to 2,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel and almost half of them have been intercepted by the ‘Iron Dome’ air defence systems in Israel. However, the loss of lives and properties during the attack has called for global concern.
