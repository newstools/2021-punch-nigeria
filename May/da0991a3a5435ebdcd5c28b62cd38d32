Hodo Williams, captain of Nigeria Women’s Football League side, Pelican Stars, says the club has set a target of winning the championship next season, The PUNCH reports. The former champions had a poor 2020/21 season where they finished 11th on the log and had to compete in the play-offs to survive the drop. The Calabar-based club finished top of the NWFL play-offs, which involved Abia Angels, Ibom Angels and Dreamstar Ladies in Benin City on Tuesday. Speaking with The PUNCH, a delighted Hodo said they had set a target of reclaiming the title next season. She said, “We are delighted to stay in the topflight, after enduring a hard time where we had a very poor season. It was one of the toughest periods for us, but thank God we survived relegation. “The spirit in camp is very high and we are all excited and celebrating. “We have set a target to contest for the championship. We are confident that with the right motivation and proper preparation we can win the title again.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
