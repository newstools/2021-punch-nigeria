The National Assembly has trained 50 directors on effective performance management at a three-day training programme facilitated by Periscope Consulting Firm in Lagos. This was disclosed in a statement released to journalists. Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Clerk, National Assembly, Amos Olatunde, described the workshop as a platform for the development of the country’s legislative environment. According to him, performance management involves holistic management discipline responsible for the correction of many relevant dots, development and enhancement. Amos described directors as front-runners, saying they must be persons of high professionalism with the ability to follow procedures in the discharge of their duties. He said, “The workshop is a good omen for the development of our legislative environment where procedure, laws and correctness of actions are sacrosanct. “Greater responsibility is required of a parliamentary staff as the ability of legislators, who have powers to make laws, to discharge their functions effectively depends largely on the effectiveness and efficiency of the legislative service provided by the bureaucracy as the engine room of the legislature.” The Lead Consultant, Periscope Consulting Firm, Bayo Adams, who was represented by the Chief Operating Officer, Rabbi Oyawale, said there were a lot of gaps in the public sector when compared to the private sector as far as effective performance management was concerned. He said the reason for this was that the performance management measurements were not done periodically. According to him, there is a need for stakeholders’ engagement as the directors are responsible for designing better solution plans for the National Assembly.
