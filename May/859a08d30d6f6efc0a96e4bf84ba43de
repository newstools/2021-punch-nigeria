The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has condemned the murder of a former Speaker of the Adamawa House of Assembly and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Ahmed Gulak. Lawan also appealed to those calling for revenge to exercise restraint and allow the security agencies to serve justice on the matter. This was contained in a statement on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi, titled, ‘Senate President condemns killing of Ahmed Gulak’. The PUNCH had earlier reported that gunmen on Sunday morning killed Gulak, in Owerri, the Imo State capital. Gulak was callously murdered while he was on his way to catch a flight at Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri. In the statement, “Lawan describes the dastardly act as one crime too many and calls for a swift investigation to bring all who are involved in the crime to justice. “The Senate President says there can be no justification for the brutal murder of a human being and fellow citizen. “Lawan, however, appeals for restraint on the part of those calling for revenge, saying they should allow the relevant authorities to serve justice on the matter as the injury of the crime was inflicted on Nigeria as a whole. “The Senate President condoles with the family and friends of the departed as well as the government and people of Adamawa State on the incident.”
