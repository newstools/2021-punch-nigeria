The Katsina State Emirate Council has dismissed Sarkin Pawwan Katsina, (district head of Kankara), Alhaji Yusuf Lawal, over alleged aiding and abetting banditry in the district. The emirate had initially suspended Lawal in April. He was, however, dismissed on Friday after the emirate received a letter from the state government, which also allegedly indicted the district head of all the allegations levelled against him. The spokesman for the emirate (Sarkin Labarai) Alhaji Ibrahim Bindawa, confirmed the development to Sunday PUNCH on Saturday. Bindawa said, “The emirate dismissed him (Lawal) yesterday ( Friday) after a letter was received from the state government which also indicted him of allegations levelled against him.” It could however not be determined as of press time whether Lawal had been handed over to the police or whether he would be prosecuted as Bindawa said he had no information on that. He said, “All I can say for now is that the emirate council has dismissed him.” It was, however, learnt that a committee set up by the emirate, after meeting security officials and other stakeholders, especially from Kankara district, found Lawal guilty of aiding and abetting banditry and kidnapping  in his domain. He was also said to have been found guilty of allegedly frustrating efforts to tackle bandits. Efforts to get Lawal’s reaction to the development were unsuccessful as he was said not to be in town while his phone lines were unreachable. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
