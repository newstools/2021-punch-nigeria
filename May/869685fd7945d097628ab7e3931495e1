The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday, said his regime would ensure that those who killed a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Ahmed Gulak, are brought to justice. Buhari said this in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled, ‘President Buhari expresses outrage, sadness over Gulak’s murder’. Gulak, a former Special Adviser on Political Matters to former President Goodluck Jonathan, was killed in Owerri, Imo State, earlier in the day. Shehu quoted the President as describing the killing a premeditated. He said the President expressed outrage and disgust over what he termed “the heinous murder of the Adamawa State-born politician, in Owerri, Imo State by yet-to-be-identified gunmen.” The statement quoted him as saying that, “I’m repulsed by such premeditated and gruesome murder of Gulak by evil people who are determined to undermine the peace, unity and territorial integrity of our country. “Let me warn however that nobody or group of people who engages in such despicable acts should expect to go free. “We will deploy all resources at our disposal to ensure that such callous and criminal elements are brought to justice.” The President extended his condolences to the family of the deceased, the people and government of Adamawa State as well as Gulak’s friends and associates.
