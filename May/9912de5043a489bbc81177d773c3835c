No fewer than 72 persons suffered varying degrees of injury following a fuel tanker explosion at a filling station in Sharada, in the Kano Municipal area on Saturday. The PUNCH gathered that fire suddenly engulfed the fuel tanker in the process of discharging petroleum products into the underground tanker of the Al-Ihsan Filling Station at the Sharada industrial area. The filling station manager, Muhammud Labaran, who confirmed the fire disaster, said 22 of the 58 persons who suffered minor injuries were treated and discharged from the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano. He, however, denied that the station was discharging fuel when the explosion occurred. According to Labaran, some overzealous social media users suffered severe burns in the process of capturing a live video of the explosion to share on their pages. The Kano State Commissioner of Works and Housing, Alhaji Idris Rimi, said, “Some staff of the state fire service, who rushed to the filling station to put out the fire, suffered injuries. They are receiving treatment at the Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
