The Nigerian Air Force has offered free medical outreach services to over 2,000 residents of Kafin Madaki in the Ganjuwa Local Government Area of Bauchi State as part of activities to mark the 57th anniversary of its establishment. The Air Commanding Officer, Special Operations Command, Bauchi, Air Vice Marshal Charles Ohwo, in his speech at the inauguration of the outreach at the Central Primary School, Kafin Madaki, said it was aimed at enhancing cordial coexistence and providing access to health care delivery and other humanitarian services to its host communities. He expressed optimism that the gesture of the NAF would go a long way in helping to improve the overall health of residents and reducing mortality from preventable diseases in communities. Ohwo said, “This outreach is intended to provide quality and comprehensive medical care for over 2,000 persons. In the course of this one-day outreach, various medical conditions would be diagnosed and treated, while those with complex cases would be referred to the 261 Nigerian Air Force Reference Hospital, Bauchi, for further evaluation and expert care. “There would also be health education, counselling, dental screening, free medicated glasses, screening for hypertension, basic laboratory screening and free drugs, among other services.” The Commissioner of Health, Bauchi State, Dr Aliyu Maigoro, who was the guest of honour, commended the Air Force for its corporate social responsibility of giving back to the poor and the less privileged in the society.
