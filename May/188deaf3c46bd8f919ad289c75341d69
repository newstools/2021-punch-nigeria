THE acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has been told to begin the process of reforming the Nigeria Police Force with a view to making it more effective and improving the welfare of personnel. The Centre for Leadership and Justice, a civil society organisation, explained that such a measure would make the new IG to gain the confidence of Nigerians. The President of the group, Mr Emmanuel Umohinyang, told our correspondent in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the current police system inherited by the acting IGP had been reduced to a mere Boys Scout, adding that the confidence Nigerians had in the police had reduced to zero. “When you also look at the incessant attacks on policemen by hoodlums, it is an indication that the respect the police enjoys from Nigerians before now has been reduced to that of Boys Scout. “That is why you see that anybody can walk into a police division and attack it or pick a bottle and smash it on the head of a policeman. The IG must first build trust and faith in the people. The IG must begin to improve the welfare of every policeman. “The welfare of the police must be uppermost if the government must win the war against insecurity. Take a look at the ramshackle place called police barracks; even pigs would not want to stay in such places. Under the immediate past IG, absolutely nothing was done with regards to police welfare,” he added. On the claim by the Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, that the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra has declared fatwa on South-East governors, Umohinyang said the governor had no reason to be afraid considering the heavy security around them.
