Lagos State Government says it has paid N38m for about 500 hectares of land acquired from 16 families at the Igbodu, Epe area of the state. The state said the land was acquired for agricultural activities. The state Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, who presented cheques to the beneficiaries in Lagos on Friday, said the hectares of land had been acquired since 1985 in the Molajoye, Aleke and Igbodu areas of Epe. According to a statement, some of the land-owning families at the event were: Eredo, Oponla Yeleru, Ojamo, Ilewu Ale, Oreta, Sharoye, Isiba Kaiye, Koleledoye, among others. Olusanya said the amount paid to each family depended on the size of land acquired from them. She said, “The programme is part of our strategies along with the five-point agenda that was launched recently towards acquiring land for an agricultural estate which will bring development to the areas. “Negotiations with the families are not only monetary because what we are doing will also bring jobs to the areas.” The Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr Hakeem Adeniji, said the presentation of cheques to the beneficiaries was a fulfilment of the state government’s promise. Speaking on behalf of the 16 families, Mr David Ogungbesan of the Oshinuga Lagooku family, which sold over 160 hectares of the land and got over N11m as compensation, thanked the state government for keeping their promise of compensating them. The Elejirin of Ejirin, Oba Rafiu Ishola, also urged people not to stall initiatives that could bring development to their areas. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
