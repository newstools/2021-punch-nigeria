Members of the Ijaw Youths Council Worldwide shifted their protest to the Rivers State office of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Olu Obasanjo Road, Port Harcourt on Friday. The protesters chased away staff of the commission and used palm fronds, broken eggs, bottles of alcoholic drinks to block the entrance of the building. Most of the staff ran out for fear of being attacked, though the protesters said they were carrying out directives of the IYC President, Peter Igbifa. This came barely 24-hours after the youths shut the interventionist agency’s corporate headquarters along the Eastern By-pass in Port Harcourt and brought activities to a halt. While they stormed the state office on Friday, the Ijaw youths hoisted their flags at the NDDC gate and demanded the sacking of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. They also mounted a canopy in front of the office, as they drum, sang, and danced, saying they will occupy the facility until their demands are met. Recall that the youths started the protest on Wednesday after the 30-day ultimatum given to the federal government to constitute a substantive board for the Commission expired. IYC Information Officer, Eastern Zone, Jim Samson said the protest was peaceful and that nothing was vandalized at the complex. He said, “The security agencies ate here. “We are asking for the sacking of Akpabio because the NDDC is under his Ministry. He is pushing that the NDDC Interim Administrator, Effiong Akwa, should stay in office for the Forensic audit to be completed. “Now the International Oil Companies are to pay 1.6 billion pounds to the NDDC which he wants to control and use for political reasons come 2023. “So, we are saying don’t give them the money. Let the NDDC board be set up so that there will be an equal representation.”
