Edniesal Consulting Limited, an enterprise governance and corporate services firm, has announced plans to host the second edition of its Chief Information Officer Awards. According to a statement issued on Monday, building on the success of the maiden edition held in Lagos in 2020, this year’s awards will recognise outstanding professionals and organisations, who have delivered business value to their organisations and industries at large through the innovative use of technology. Chief Executive Officer of Edniesal Consulting, Abiola Laseinde, said, “CIOs have over time been responsible for delivering top-of-the-line innovation and business value within their organisations while also being at the forefront of decision-making and strategic change. “This class of business leaders is hardly visible nor celebrated in most organisations, but now their role has increased in importance over time as they evolve from information to innovation and leading the digital transformation initiatives.” Meanwhile, The CIO Club Africa recently held its inaugural meeting where it appointed board members and executives to manage the affairs of the group, the statement said. The club was launched by Edniesal Consulting Limited at the maiden edition of The CIO Awards in 2020. The new executives include but not limited to Country BSS Director, Nigerian Bottling Company as the president. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
