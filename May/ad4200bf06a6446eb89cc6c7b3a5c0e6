Popular Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho, on Saturday, joined other agitators at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, Osogbo, the Osun State capital, to demand Yoruba Nation. Igboho, who spoke at the venue of the mega rally, also demanded the release of operatives of the Oodua Peoples Congress who were detained for arresting notorious Fulani herder, Iskilu Wakili, in the Ibarapa area of Oyo State. The venue of the rally was heavy with the presence of operatives of the Nigeria Police Force as well as men of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. Also sighted at the venue were men of Amotekun corps, who were positioned at a strategic spot, apparently to prevent participants from accessing the venue.
