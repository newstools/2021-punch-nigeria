The principal of Government Day Secondary School Ruma, Batsari Local Government Area of Katsina State, Malam Sa’idu Usha, has been abducted by gunmen. Residents said Usha was abducted on Friday evening after closing for the day and was returning to Batsari from Ruma. The gunmen reportedly abandoned the motorcycle Usha was riding on and forced him to enter the forest. One of the residents said, “The mallam was forced down from his motorcycle and taken away. The motorcycle was abandoned in the middle of the road and since then, we have not heard anything from him.” Another source said, “The kidnappers have called Malam Sani’s immediate family but they didn’t ask for anything. When we called them after Asr ( 4 p.m prayers), they said we should stop calling them.” The gunmen were yet to contact the family since then. The spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, Gambo Isah, did not respond to the text message sent to him on the incident. He did not also pick his calls. A source at the headquarters of the state Ministry of Education said Usha’s issue would become clearer on Monday when officials of the ministry would be around to make necessary contacts with his family. The source, who pleaded for anonymity, said, “Kindly come to the ministry on Monday. Our officials would have made necessary contacts and have a clearer picture of the incident.”
