Grand Treasurers Limited has said it disbursed over N734m loans to its customers in six months. It said on Thursday in a statement titled ‘Grand Treasurers Ltd disburses N734m in six months’ that this was part of its efforts to support individuals, small and medium-scale enterprises. The company said it was committed to offering its loans at a competitive interest rate with minimal documentation to individuals in the private and public sectors, in the agricultural, manufacturing, trade, and general commerce with loans and lease to boost their business operation. The Managing Director, Mr Adetunji Tolani, said the firm had always been about delivering value to its customers, irrespective of the size of business. He said, “Despite the important role SMEs play in stimulating growth in the economy and job creation, access to finance has over the years bewildered them – well-meaning businesses with great ideas and plan that would have thrived have died prematurely due to poor access to finance. “Hence, why we are in the business to provide such businesses with a flexible and easy access to funds as well as investment opportunities to bridge the gap.” The statement said that GTL, which is a subsidiary of Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc also offered lease to corporate, retails organisations and to hospitals for the purchase of medical equipment. Other services offered by GTL includes treasury services to individuals and corporate firms, payroll loans to civil servants, personal loans to workers, project loans, local purchase loans among others, the statement added.
