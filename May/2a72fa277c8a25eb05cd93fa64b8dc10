The leadership of the Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria in Osun state has warned practitioners that had failed to regularise their membership as directed by the Economic Financial Crimes Commission to act immediately or risk sanctions. This was contained in a statement signed by the new Osun REDAN chairman, Victor Eniola-Mark, obtained on Sunday. Eniola-Mark, who expressed concern over activities of fraudsters and unregistered practitioners handling purchase of landed property, then declared readiness to sanitise real estate business in the state, and ensure that operators follow due process from the purchase of land to construction of structures. The statement, “Our enemies as practitioners in this business remain fraudsters and unregistered practitioners, who usually defraud many unsuspecting members of the public and as a result, tarnish the image of real and responsible operators. “It is on this note that we want to sound a note of warning to erring practitioners who by their actions have rejected the call by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission that all practitioners should identify with REDAN, with a view to tracking illegal funds in the sub sector. They should have a rethink.” It added the present administration would soon pay attention to the defaulters in order to get rid of bad eggs in the real estate sector. Copyright PUNCH.
