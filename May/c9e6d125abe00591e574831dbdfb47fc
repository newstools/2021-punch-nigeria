The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has said that the actions of the nation’s security agencies may save Nigeria from current security challenges. According to a statement on Thursday signed by Towoju Raphael on behalf of the ministry’s Director of Press, the minister spoke at the commencement of an inter-agencies training on Nigeria Internal Security and Public Safety Alert System in Abuja. The statement was titled, ‘FG flags-off inter-agencies training on internal security, public safety alert system.’ “What you do may save Nigeria from security threats,” the minister, who was represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Dr Shuaib Belgore, was quoted as saying. He said the ministry was mindful of the country’s current situation, hence the need to maintain proper synergy among the security agencies under its watch and others in the country. He stated that the training would guarantee effective intelligence gathering, prompt response to emergency distress calls, and inter-agency collaboration. Aregbesola called on participants, who would be posted to the ministry’s situation room after the training, to ensure that they are always punctual to be able to respond promptly to emergencies.
