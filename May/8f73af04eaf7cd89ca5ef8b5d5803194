Mr Jacob Oyedepo, the father of the late airman, Matthew Oyedepo, has said his son’s death will not make him stop the siblings of the deceased from joining the Army. Matthew died in the ill-fated Beechcraft 350 that crash landed in Kaduna last Friday, killing former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and, nine others. Oyedepo, who hails from Ora-Igbomina, Osun State, in a chat with newsmen, said the deceased was his last child, adding that he had five other older siblings that were unemployed. The bereaved father, who said he spoke to Matthew a day before the incident and offered him prayers, added that there was no inkling of the impending danger hanging around his son, during their last conversation. He said, “I spoke to my son on Thursday that preceded the day he died. I prayed for him. I did not see or have any sign that he was going to die. I just prayed for him. His death has left a permanent vacuum. I will never forget him. He was the one taking care of me. His brothers are unemployed. He was also taking care of them. “I plead with the government to help in providing jobs for the siblings of the deceased that are not employed. Matthew is my last child and I have six children. Even with his death, I will not discourage any of my children who is willing to join military, I will allow them follow their hearts.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
