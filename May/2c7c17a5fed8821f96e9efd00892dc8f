An organisation, Book Swap Foundation is set to provide children with free access to storybooks. A statement by the organisation said its goal was to provide a community of children with 300 different storybooks, adding that each child would be given one book, which they would be able to swap with one another. The statement reads partly, “Our goal is to provide a community of children with 300 different storybooks. Each child will be given one book, which they will be able to swap with each other. This means that each child in that community will be able to potentially read 300 different books. “We plan to establish 3,000 swap spots in communities locally and nationally. “With the support of our leaders, employers, teachers and parents, we will provide 900,000 children with storybooks to read. In doing so, the Book Swap Initiative hopes to contribute to the government’s commitment to realising the rights of all children in a bid to help them build a strong foundation and have the best chance of fulfilling their potential.” It added that the Book Swap Foundation’s inauguration would be held via a zoom meeting on May 6, 2021.
