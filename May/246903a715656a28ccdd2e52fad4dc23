The Chairman of Foundation for Partnerships Initiatives in the Niger Delta, Mr. Jeff Ewing, has disclosed that farmers in the nine states of the Niger Delta region made a profit of N10.3bn in the last five years. He made this known in his message in the 2019 annual report of the organisation tagged “Building a prosperous and stable Niger Delta”, saying the narratives changed following the adoption of modern farming techniques as against the traditional method that yielded low profits. Ewing also noted that 2019 marked the end of the second five-year strategic funding phase and nine years of solid programming of the PIND Foundation, adding that no fewer than 20, 788 new jobs have been created by the organisation, in collaboration with the farmers in the period under review. “Smallholder farmers and agro-allied enterprises suffered drudgery from use of traditional technologies, and made poor returns because of wrong practices, weak market linkages and little or no business advisory services. “Today, many of these farmers are using hundreds of over 10 varieties of modern agricultural technologies, have adopted best practices through business support, have to need a 10.3 billion naira profit (from six million in phase 1) and created 20,788 new jobs (from 131 in phase 1) as a result,” he said. In the same vein, the Executive Director, PIND Foundation, Mr. Dara Akala, has also said the organisation has helped to achieve 22 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the region, adding that there was a need to continue in the development strides.
