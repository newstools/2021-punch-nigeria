Residents of five villages of the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State fled on Tuesday when bandits, who had on Monday earlier killed 10 persons and abducted many others, returned to the area while the victims were being buried. An indigene of the area, Malam Musa Sani, said the bandits who were on motorcycles had earlier invaded Dandamji, Gidan Runji, Doka, Yanmadanga and Yarkatsina villages around 5pm on Monday when they killed the 10 people and abducted many. Sani added that the bandits, who also stole a large number of domestic animals, operated for several hours due to non-presence of the security agents. He said, “The bandits returned to the communities during the funeral of the 10 people they had earlier killed. “We saw them approaching and everybody took to his heels, leaving the corpses. “Many villages have been deserted and the people have relocated to other places.” The spokesperson for the state police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, confirmed the killing of the 10 people, adding that 10 bandits were also killed. Shehu said, “At about 11pm in the night on Monday, the police responded to a distress call from Mada District of Gusau LGA that bandits stormed the area. “The bandits were engaged in a gun duel by the joint police, vigilante operatives. Ten bandits were neutralised while others escaped. Normalcy was restored in the area.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
