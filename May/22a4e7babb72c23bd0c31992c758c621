Following PUNCH’s report, police operatives of the Anti-Car Theft Unit of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have released a car sales agent, Martins Izuchukwu, who was in their custody for 47 days. Our correspondent had reported that Martins was arrested and detained by men of the Anti-Car Theft of the Federal Capital Territory Police Command after his partner, identified only as Thankgod, allegedly absconded with the N1.2m a customer paid for a car at Nyanya, in the Abuja Municipal Area Council. Martins confirmed to PUNCH Metro that he had been granted bail by the police. He said, “I was released on bail with a promise to assist them in arresting the suspect, who is still at large. I was arrested where I went to inspect a house with one of my customers. I was beaten before a policeman took me to the Gwarinpa Police Division. I was tortured while in custody. The police made many false accusations against me.” The victim’s mother, Adanne, said no progress was made in securing her son’s release until our correspondent published the report. “Everyone I gave money for help on this case didn’t make any progress until your report,” she added.
