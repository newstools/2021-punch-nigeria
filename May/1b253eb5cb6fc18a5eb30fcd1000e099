The Chairman of Peace Airline, Mr Allen Onyema, has said Nigeria is failing due to the neglect of the education sector. Onyema said this during the Dominican University, Ibadan, virtual fundraising event, urging Nigerians to support the education of youths. “Nigeria is presently going downhill due to persistent neglect of education.  We have a high number of people who take to kidnapping for ransom and other vices which has led to insecurity in Nigeria.  There is need for all Nigerians to support the Dominican University because the university is providing education with learning and good character formation,” he said. Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Dominican University, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Ibadan, Most Rev. Felix Job, urged Nigerians to make it a duty to help educational institutions  in the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
