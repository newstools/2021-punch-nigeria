Justin said he was impressed with his team’s outing despite the loss, but rued their missed chances. “We didn’t utilise the chances we created. We have to learn from the game. We didn’t utilise our chances and we got punished for it,” Justin said. “We have been down from the beginning of the season, we are still trying to gel and that will take us for a while. These are lessons we have to learn.” On the game’s officiating, the gaffer added, “As long as there are opportunities, there will always be hope. If it was fair, if it was good, people can judge. “I’m more concerned with the mistakes my team made and how I will correct them. I don’t need to expend too much energy. We need to improve ourselves.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
