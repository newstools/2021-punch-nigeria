Nike Popoola  JoeBass Property Limited has expressed commitment to bridging housing deficit gap in Lagos State. In a statement on Sunday titled ‘Firm bridges housing deficit gap with delight estate’, the property firm disclosed that it unveiled Delight Estate to help people to achieve the dream of becoming landlords. It stated that the estate which is on 25 hectares of land on Lekki-Epe Expressway was aimed at supporting the government in addressing house scarcity, and also offered appreciable return on investment. The Chairman, JoeBass Property Limited, Bassey Effiong, said the Lekki-Epe expressway was regarded as new Lagos economic hub because of different developments that were ongoing simultaneously in the area. Effiong added that subscribing to Delight Estate meant buying into new community where there is going to be a new cargo airport, refinery, Free Trade Zone and where the fourth Mainland bridge that is taking off from Ikorodu would terminate. He said the estate was strategically positioned to provide accommodation for people that would be working in the new Lagos economic hub. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
