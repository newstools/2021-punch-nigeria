Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Commander of Oyo State Security Network Agency also known as Amotekun, Col. Olayinka Olayanju, (retd), has said some of the aides of Governor Seyi Makinde are indirectly backing hoodlums terrorising the people of the state. The Amotekun commander disclosed this on Tuesday while speaking on a radio station, Fresh FM. Residents of Ibadan communities have recently been living in constant fears following the increased cases of hoodlum attacks. Three persons were reportedly shot and injured in a fresh attack that occurred on Sunday. Olayanju said some senior aides of the governor have in the past pleaded that the agency should free suspected hoodlums arrested in connection with civil disturbances in some parts of the state capital. Olayanju, however, declined to mention the names of the governor’s aides, who pestered him to release the arrested suspects. He said, “Some people would come to plead that we should release those arrested. We arrested some in (Ibadan) North-East less than a week ago and one SA ( Special Adviser) was running around begging us. He came and met me around NTA and I told him that we have handed them over to the police at Yemetu. I won’t mention the name. He is SA to the governor, some are chairmen, some are lawmakers who seek such a favour.” When asked whether the governor’s aides were behind the unrest in the state capital, the Amotekun commander replied, “That is what we are saying.”
