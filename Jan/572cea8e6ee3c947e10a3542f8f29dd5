Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has dismissed speculations that he was plotting to dump the Peoples Democratic Party. Ikpeazu made his position on the issue known during a PDP stakeholder meeting and inauguration of newly elected council chairmen and deputies, in Umuahia, late on Sunday. Ikpeazu said, “As the leader in Abia State today, I don’t speak for myself alone, I belong to a political family. “I think Abia State is comfortable in PDP. Therefore, I do not think that conversation is proper before us and tenable at this moment.” Speaking in a similar vein, the Abia State Chairman of the PDP, Asiforo Okere said, “There are no defections from PDP to other parties, rather, it is the other way. The only thing that is going on is ‘longer throat’. Also speaking, the National Organizing Secretary of the party, Col. Austin Akobundu said, “Part of what we have done today is to speed up Abia on what the policies and agenda of the party is so that the state does not lag behind.” Copyright PUNCH.
