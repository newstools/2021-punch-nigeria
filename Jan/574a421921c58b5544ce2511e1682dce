Peter Dada, Akure A couple, Mr and Mrs Gbenga Ibikunle who was kidnapped and freed last week has disclosed that a sum of N2 million was collected by the bandits before they were released to their family. The couple was kidnapped by some unknown gunmen along the Akure-Owo Expressway at Uso community in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State
while travelling with their children from Ebonyi State to Akure last Tuesday. It was learnt that the kidnappers dragged the victims into the forest leaving their three children in their Lexus saloon car. Ibikunle, who spoke with our correspondent on Monday, also debunked a report that they were rescued by the team of security men, saying their freedom came after a ransom was paid three days after their abduction. He said, “I am surprised with the claims that we were rescued by the police. This is nothing but a lie coming from the pit of hell. I can say it boldly that, no security agency came to our rescue. We were released around 1am after ransom was paid to them. “They (bandits) collected the ransom along the road without being jittery. In fact, they counted all the money before they released us to my brother, who brought the N2million.” He called on the government to be more proactive on the security situation of the state and the country at large, saying the Nigerian roads were no more safe for travellers. “I am weeping for this country because we are not safe. We can no longer travel. “We don’t have security in this country anymore. It is sad that our security agencies are not effective. The kidnappers carried out their operations with impunity. They boasted that they will kill any policeman that wanted to rescue us,” he stated.
