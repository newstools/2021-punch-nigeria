Peter Dada, Akure Counsel to the All Progressives Congress and that of the Independent National Electoral Commission, cross-examined the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Eyitayo Jegede SAN, during Tuesday’s sitting of the Election Petition Tribunal, in Akure. Jegede had filed a petition to challenge the outcome of the governorship election in which Governor Rotimi Akeredolu SAN, was declared the winner by the INEC. As part of his grounds for the petition, Jegede is challenging the validity of Akeredolu’s nomination by the APC. During the cross-examination, lawyers to the defendants, Chief Lateef Fagbemi and Chief Akin Olujimi said Jegede, who was not a member of the APC could not interfere in the internal affairs of the party. Similarly, INEC’s counsel, Mr Charles Edonsanmiwan, asked, “Mr. Jegede, are you a member of the All Progressives Congress?” The petitioner answered “No. I am a member of the PDP.” Jegede, however, argued that since he contested the said election with the APC candidate, it was within his rights to question the process that produced Akeredolu as the party’s standard-bearer. The tribunal adjourned sitting till Wednesday.
