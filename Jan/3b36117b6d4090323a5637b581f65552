Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin THE Edo State Council of the Nigeria Union of Teachers has directed primary school teachers and school heads to embark on an indefinite strike as from next week Monday, January 18. The state NUT urged all parents to keep their children and wards away from schools throughout the period of the indefinite strike. It also advised school heads and parents to disregard any form of propaganda, blackmail, announcements, pronouncements and intimidation against the “lawful decisions” of the union for the period of the strike from any quarter. A communique signed by state Chairman, Pius Okhueleigbe; Assistant Secretary General, Moni Modesty Itua, and three others, indicated that the teachers were embarking on the strike as a result of the failure of the Edo State Government to meet its 10-points long- age demands. It noted that the strike ordered was sequel to the expiration of the 21-day and 14-day ultimatum earlier issued to the state government. The communique read in part, “All public primary school heads and teachers in the 18 local government areas of Edo State should unfailingly embark on an indefinite strike action from 12:00 am (early morning) of Monday January 18, 2012 and ensure that all teaching and learning tools in their possessions are completely put in off-mode.” Copyright PUNCH.
