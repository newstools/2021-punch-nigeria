Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebonyi State Commissioner for Internal Security, Mr Stanley Okoroemegha, has given security agencies 48 hours to brief the state government on how the security breach that led to the shooting to death of three policemen occurred without any intelligence to forestall it. The commissioner said the government was saddened by the incident. Three police officers were shot dead, while two others sustained bullet wounds at the Onueke Police Station in the Ezza South Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent gathered that the policemen were attacked by gunmen, who stormed the police station on Saturday. Investigation revealed that the slain officers were two male inspectors and one policewoman, who was relaxing in her room when the gunmen struck. It was also gathered that the attackers took away two AK-47 rifles kept at the station. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs Loveth Oda, who confirmed the incident, explained that the corpses of the slain officers had been deposited in a mortuary, while the two, who sustained bullet wounds, were receiving treatment.
