Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia The Abia State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has disowned Chief Sylvanus Nwaji, who allegedly left its fold to join the All Progressive Congress last week. The PDP said Nwaji, a former Transition Committee Chairman of Ukwa West Local Government Area, who announced his move to the APC was never a member of the PDP. This was contained in a statement signed by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Chief Fabian Nwankwo, in Umuahia, on Sunday. The statement read in part, “…Even in his response during his Igbere decampment ceremony, Nwaji accepted that he was never a member of the PDP but was merely appointed to serve in a PDP government out of the political benevolence of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and the PDP. “It was obvious that the Nwaji story bears testimony to the political magnanimity of the PDP and Governor Ikpeazu that has ensured that people of different political persuasions and orientations are allowed to contribute to serve the state, including the nomination and election of a former #EndSARS protester as a deputy chairman of a local government in the recent election in the state, without hindrance.” Copyright PUNCH.
