Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A yet-to-be-identified woman, who was abducted along the Ilesha-Akure Expressway in Osun State on Sunday, has regained her freedom. The spokesperson for the Osun State Police Command, Yemisi Opalola, had confirmed the abduction of two passengers between Omo Ijesa and Erin Ijesa along the Ilesha-Akure Expressway in a chat with The PUNCH. She said the victims, a man, and a woman were travelling from Erin Ijesa when their vehicle was attacked. While the man was rescued on Monday, the search for the woman did not immediately yield result as a combined team of members of Oodua Peoples Congress, vigilante operatives and police team combed the forest around Omo hill. In a chat with our correspondent on Wednesday, Osun OPC Coordinator, Prince Deji Aladesawe, said the woman was rescued late Tuesday. Aladesawe, however, said OPC men would not retreat from the area as another 18-passenger bus was found at the same spot where the rescued victims were abducted, saying the whereabouts of the passengers of the bus could not be ascertained. He feared the passengers in the bus might have been abducted as well. Also in a statement sent to our correspondent, Opalola said, â€œThis is to inform you that the kidnapped victims along Akure road have been rescued yesterday night during joint operations of NPF, hunters, Amotekun, Vigilante and JTF men while combing the forest in that area.
