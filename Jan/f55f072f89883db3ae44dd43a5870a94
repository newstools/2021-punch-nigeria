Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The People’s Democratic Party in Ekiti State on Monday accused the governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, of abandoning the state for armed bandits to operate without challenge. PDP factional State Publicity Secretary, Raphael Adeyanju, who said it was getting to a level where Ekiti residents would not even be safe in their bedrooms, said, “The kidnapping of a popular petroleum products dealer, Alhaji Sulaiman Akinbami, in the premises of his petrol station in Ado Ekiti, the State capital, on Sunday is a major danger signal.” Adeyanju in a statement titled, ‘Insecurity: Ekiti PDP accuses Fayemi of abandoning governance’, stated, “That Alhaji Akinbami could be kidnapped right in the heart of Ado Ekiti, the state capital, is a clear indication that security of lives and properties of Ekiti people is no longer guaranteed even in their bedrooms. “It is either Governor Fayemi is grossly incompetent or he is simply looking the other way while Ekiti people are being kidnapped by bandits so that those he believed can make him either President or Vice President in 2023 can adjudge him as being politically correct,” the PDP stated. But the Special Assistant to the Governor on Public Communications, Segun Dipe, who said security should be taken serious by every citizen, assured that the state government would continue to provide the needed support to the security agencies in protecting lives and property. Dipe said, “Let me first and foremost say that security is everybody’s duty and job. It starts from the family and individuals. Government can only put security checks in some places because of security threats. “Government will continue to do its best, but saying we are not doing enough is not correct. Government has put a lot of measures in place and don’t forget that security is also personal, you must first protect yourself. I can assure you that the state government will continue to fish out the bad eggs among us in the society,” the governor’s aide said.
