Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Government said it has impounded 18 tricycles and arrested some operators who allegedly defied the government’s directive banning them from operating on major roads in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas. Governor Nyesom Wike had signed an executive order banning tricycles from operating on major roads in the two LGAs. The State Commissioner for Transport, Barr. Osima Gina who disclosed the arrest while speaking with newsmen in Port Harcourt said despite the success recorded in sanitising the roads, security agencies pose a major challenge to them. The Commissioner explained that sometimes security personnel release defaulters arrested by its enforcement team, describing it as worrisome. “We have actually sanitized the major roads. I will say we have achieved about 90 per cent success. But we have some challenges because the security operatives are not cooperating with us. “We also discovered that some of these tricycles are owned by security men and you know that when security is not cooperating with you, you will have some difficulties. “We have impounded about 18 keke in our activity. They even attacked members of the taskforce and inflicted Injuries on them. We also arrested some of the keke drivers and they were taken to court and remanded in correctional centre. “So the governor is serious about it. He is not backing out. Now let me tell you, if the keke people refused to obey, the union has given their words after we engaged them in stakeholders meetings severally before the festive period and they gave their word. “In fact about three or four occasions, the union joined us to the field and in some areas where we visited, the union on their own impounded keke. But the police released them. “So, it is an issue I think the government is going to look into. But rest assured that the government is not backing off. We will sanitize the operations of keke,” Barr. Gina said.
