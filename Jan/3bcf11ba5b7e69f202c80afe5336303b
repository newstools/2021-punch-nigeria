Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Speaker of Kogi State House of Assembly, Mathew Kolawole, has described Governor Yahaya Bello, as the best person to lead Nigeria come 2023. Kolawole said this when he led seven of his colleagues to solicit the support of their counterparts in Ebonyi State. He explained that the North-Central and South-East regions deserve to produce the next President and Vice President of Nigeria as they were the most marginalised since the return of democracy in 1999. According to him, Governor David Umahi’s decision to join the All Progressives Congress, was in the best interest of the South- East. He said, “Your people will benefit more. We in Kogi House have a robust relationship with the executive arm. For best functionality you need cordiality with other arms. Our governor is the youngest and doing well, including in the area of security. We have borders with nine states. “We have passed a vote of confidence on him. We went further to look at the geopolitical zone in the country. We passed the resolution that our governor should be the first to contest the presidency in 2023. The Kogi Speaker said a combination of Bello as President and Umahi as Vice President was all Nigeria needed to build on the achievements of the current regime. Speaking on the subject, the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Francis Nwifuru, said, “I appeal that if the party zones the presidential position to the South-East zone, the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi should be supported to rule the country, while Governor Bello can still be supported to be his Vice President.” Copyright PUNCH.
