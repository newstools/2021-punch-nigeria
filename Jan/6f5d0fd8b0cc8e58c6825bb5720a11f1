Peter Dada,  Akure The crisis rocking the Ondo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party is still unresolved as some leaders of the party have rejected the suspension of the state lawmaker,  Mr Rasheed Elegbeleye, and some chieftains of the party. Elegbeleye, who is the Minority Leader of the state House of Assembly, together with some leaders of the party, was suspended by the state executive of the party for alleged anti-party activities. In a statement by the leaders including the chairman,  the deputy chairman and secretary of the Akoko North-East Local Government chapter of the party, Mr Ayelumo Peter, Salisu Jimoh and Aderinboye Samuel respectively,  the leaders accused the state executive of taking decision without carrying members of the party in the local government along. The statement reads partly, “The suspension of our House of Assembly member was an affront on the local government in which there was no reference to the local government and no due process in their action. “We are telling the state executive not to distabilise the party in the local government with rumours from disgruntled elements without proper investigation. The leaders who passed a vote of confidence on the minority leader, advised the state executive to always follow due process before any disciplinary action was taken on members. Copyright PUNCH.
