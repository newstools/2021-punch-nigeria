Nike Popoola Jaiz Bank and National Hajj Commission have launched a Hajj savings scheme that will make it easier for Muslims in Nigeria to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj. A statement titled ‘JAIZ, NAHCON launch Hajj savings scheme in Kwara, Oyo’, said the launch and sensitisation took place in Ilorin, Kwara State on Wednesday, and in Ibadan on Thursday, with many stakeholders in attendance. Speaking at the occasions, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Jaiz Bank, Hassan Usman, represented by Ismaila Adamu, said the national Hajj savings scheme was a significant milestone for all stakeholders in the hajj ecosystem in Nigeria. He said the importance of the scheme emanated from the fact that right ‘from planning, funding to actual operations, the scheme had the potential to positively affect every act and actor in the process’. “With such a scheme in place, intending pilgrims that do not have the wherewithal can gradually plan and actualise their dream without stress by saving gradually,” he said. He said that even those who did not live long enough to complete their savings might still in ‘Allah’s infinite mercy’, receive the reward for hajj because they were pilgrims by bringing intention and action together.
