PETER DADA The men of the Ondo State Police Command have arrested two persons in connection with the abduction of a couple, Mr and Mrs Gbenga Ibikunle in the state. The couple were kidnapped by some suspected gunmen along Akure-Owo Expressway at Uso community while travelling with their children from Ebonyi State to Akure on Tuesday. It was learnt that the kidnappers dragged the victims into the forest leaving their three children in their Lexus saloon car. A source said it was a team of policemen that were deployed in the scene that took the three children to the police station in Uso. It was also gathered that the kidnappers had contacted the family of the abducted couple and demanded N20m ransom to secure their release. In a reaction, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, who confirmed the development, said the crack detectives comprising the police, the military, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and Amotekun were already on top of the situation while investigations were ongoing. He said, “As I speak with you, the detectives are combing the forest and I am sure they will soon be released. We heard they were asking for N20m ransom, but we are not interested in that. Rather, we are going after them and the victims would soon be released.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
