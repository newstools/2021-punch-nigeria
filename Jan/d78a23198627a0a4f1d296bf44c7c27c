Globacom has said it is availing all inactive prepaid customers who have not used their lines for 30 consecutive days with 22 times value on every recharge of N100 and above. A statement issued by the company on Sunday said with the offer, subscribers who recharged with N100 would be credited with N2,200 value. Globacom stated, “First, they will receive the N100 recharge amount in their main account, which they can use on any Glo product as they wish.” In addition, they will receive a bonus value of N2,100, which can be used for voice calls to all networks in Nigeria and for data, it added.
