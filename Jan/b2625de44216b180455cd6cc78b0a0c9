Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Edo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has called on the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, and the former media coordinator for the state APC in the 2020 governorship poll, John Mayaki, to accept the defeat suffered in the hands of Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. The state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Nehikhare, in a statement said unwarranted attacks on the governor and his administration by Oshiomhole and Mayaki, especially the latest attack over an alleged N18bn loan request, demonstrated an obsession with propagation of falsehood to curry public sympathy after humiliating defeat at the polls. Nehikhare dismissed the loan claim, stating that the governor was not profligate. Nehikhare said, “The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, is not profligate like Oshiomhole and this much is evident from the governor’s leadership style as well as the manner in which he has managed the state’s resources to the admiration of local and foreign partners, who continue to commend the prudent, transparent and judicious allocation of resource in pursuit of sustainable development and economic advancement in the state.” “There is no denying that Edo people are tired of the lies and falsehoods propagated by Oshiomhole and his minions. It is high time they embrace the Resetting Agenda of the Governor Obaseki and the PDP.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
