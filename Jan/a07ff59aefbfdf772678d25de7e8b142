Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebonyi State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has petitioned the state police command, Department of State Security, and other security agencies over alleged threat to the life of its Chairman, Elder Fred Udeogu, by suspected thugs. The party in the petition signed by Udeogu, copies of which were made available to journalists, in Abakaliki on Thursday, urged the security agencies to, as a matter urgency, investigate the allegation, arrest and prosecute the said thugs to avert further security breach. The petition read in part, “I write to bring your attention to the evil plot against my life by the Governor of Ebonyi State, His Excellency, David Umahi, whose plot started when I was made Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ebonyi State. “Immediately, upon assumption of office as PDP Caretaker Committee Chairman, the governor sent his men led by the person he appointed the All Progressives Congress Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mr Stanley Okoro-Emegha after me to retrieve a vehicle that was gifted to me as one of the elders of the state. “Mr Okoro-Emegha called, threatened and invaded my house with fierce-looking thugs. In order to avoid any trouble, I returned the car to the governor.” However, the state Caretaker Chairman of the APC, Mr Okoro-Emegha, denied the allegations describing them as false. He said, “I am the Commissioner for Internal Security, and he should know that the vehicle was allotted to him as the Chairman of the Abakaliki Capital Territory Board. Now when he is relieved from his duties, was he supposed to go with the official vehicle meant for the board?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
