Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt As the University of Port Harcourt resumes full academic activities March 1, 2021, the management of the institution has unveiled one of its 400 test-per day molecular laboratories dedicated to COVID-19 testing for undergraduates and staff. The university also unveiled two of its COVID-19 holding centres with seven brand new ventilators and oxygen bottles, rolling out its stipulated safety protocols and compliance enforcement measures in tandem with international best practices. Speaking in Port Harcourt on Thursday, following a media tour to the facilities in the institution’s campuses, the acting Vice Chancellor, University of Port Harcourt, Prof. Stephen Okodudu, said the university achieve the feat after consultations between the management and its COVID-19 steering committee which consist of professionals. He said, “As you may have noticed, we have hard hand washing basins at strategic locations around the campus, at the hostels and classrooms with water and lf course the idea is for students and staff to constantly wash their hands for at least 20 seconds under running water as that is one of the most effective ways of fighting coronavirus. “We have two COVID-19 treatment centres, one is currently active, they were donated to us by an alumni member of our university that graduated in the 1980’s including myself and Amni International Petroleum Development Company Limited, the second one is at the final stage of being activated as NDDC and Tetfund donated some facilities to us which we are going to install.” Copyright PUNCH.
