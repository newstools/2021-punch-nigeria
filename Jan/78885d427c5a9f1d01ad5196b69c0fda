Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A mobile Magistrate’s Court in Ado Ekiti, on Thursday, sentenced 10 persons to one month’s imprisonment each for dumping refuse in unauthorised locations in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. The magistrate, Timothy Abe, said, “The culprits were found culpable under the Environmental Laws of 2020 and consequently sentenced to one month imprisonment each with an option of fine.” The prosecutors, Mrs Bolaji Ogunsan and Mr Sunday Ogundoro, said men of Ekiti State Environmental Task Force caught the offenders in the act of dumping refuse on the road median in the Similoluwa, Adebayo and Adehun areas of Ado Ekiti. In her remark, the state Commissioner for Environment, Mrs Iyabo Fakunle-Okieimen, said, “Anyone found violating the environmental laws in the state will be penalised in accordance with the extant laws. “The Fayemi government will be relentless in its efforts to fight against any act that can constitute nuisance to the environment.” Copyright PUNCH.
