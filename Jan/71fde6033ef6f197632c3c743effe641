Tony Okafor, Awka The Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly Worldwide has commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of the service chiefs. The President General of the group, Onyeachonam Onuorah, in a statement on Wednesday in Awka, the Anambra State capital, said the President did well by yielding to the long-time expectations of Nigerians for the change of the security architecture. He, however, noted that there was no Igbo man among the service chiefs, saying the office of the Inspector General of Police, whose occupant would soon retire, should be given to the Igbo. The statement reads partly, “There is no Igbo man  among the newly appointed service chiefs. Those who claim that the newly appointed Chief of Defence Staff, Maj. Gen. Leo Irabor, is an Igbo man should tell us if Irabor is an Igbo name. “As the Inspector General of Police is due for retirement, we call on the Federal Government to consider an Igbo man for the position of new Inspector General of Police.” Copyright PUNCH.
