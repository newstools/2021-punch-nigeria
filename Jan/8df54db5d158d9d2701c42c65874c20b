Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has attributed insecurity facing Nigeria to injustice and lack of equity in the country. He spoke on Sunday during the interdenominational service to mark the 2021 Armed Forces Remembrance Day at the King of Glory Chapel, Government House, Yenagoa. Diri said the ugly situation would have been avoidable if the leaders of the country respected the rule of law and justice. He called for better funding and equipping of the Nigerian Armed Forces. According to him, this would serve as motivation for the military in the bid to end insurgency and insecurity in the country. Diri while saluting the ex-servicemen for their sacrifices, said, “For me, it is a day to call upon the federal and state governments to look again at what we do and ensure that as leaders our watchword should be that of justice and equity. “Much of the insurrection, the violence, and the conflicts in Nigeria today are avoidable if only we respect justice and equity. “The Federal Government is spending so much but we believe that they can still spend more in terms of equipment and better welfare for the personnel.” He urged the Federal Government to look into the issue of insecurity in the country and accord it the necessary importance that it deserves. The Bayelsa governor noted that society needed to also do enough in respecting the lives of every security personnel just as they honour the memories of fallen soldiers.
