Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia NO fewer than 2,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Aba North Local Government Area of Abia State, on Thursday, defected to the All Progressives Congress. The Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Kalu, received them on behalf of the State Chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa and Chairman of Caretaker Committee of the APC, Gov. Mai Buni, in his country home in Igbere. Kalu, a former governor of the state, urged the defectors to work for the party’s victory in the 2023 general elections. He said, “Today is a remarkable day and I want to welcome you to this great party. It is a party for all Nigerians and we believe that this party will make all of us proud. “The party believes in the rule of law. This is a party that believes things should be done well; this is a party that believes in all Nigerians.” The APC House of Representatives candidate for Aba North and South in the 2019 general elections, Chief Mascot Kalu, commended the defectors for their decision, saying that the party’s doors were still open for more defectors. Responding on behalf of the defectors, Bunch Adiele and Eze Agege, said, “We are your sons and daughters residing and doing business in Aba North Local Government Area. “All the wards in Aba North Local Government Area are all represented here. Before 25th of this month; the real exodus will be seen as over 2,500 PDP faithful will move in to join APC with us.” Copyright PUNCH.
