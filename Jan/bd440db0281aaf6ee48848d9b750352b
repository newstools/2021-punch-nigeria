John Alechenu, Abuja A faction of the All Progressives Congress loyal to the Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Thursday, accused failed politicians of trying to destabilise the party. The governor’s supporters, acting under the aegis of Kwara APC Elders Forum, alleged that persons who tried but failed in their bid to become governor, were behind the emergence of a group of party supporters trying to undermine the governor. Chairman of the forum, Kunle Suleiman said this when he led a delegation of party faithful to a media briefing at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja. He was accompanied to the briefing by Nigeria’s immediate-past ambassador to Malaysia, Nurudeen Muhammed and Senator Suleiman Ajadi. In a veiled reference to the Minister of Information, Culture and National Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and the Minister of State for Transport, Gbemisola Saraki, Suleiman said, “Those ministers and association of failed governorship aspirants can come to Abuja to say nonsense but they are just paperweight politicians. They have no influence at the grassroots.” The group threw its weight behind the decision of the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, to appoint Abdullahi Samari as Acting Kwara State Chairman of the party.
