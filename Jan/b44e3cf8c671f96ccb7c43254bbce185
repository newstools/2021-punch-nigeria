Hindi Livinus The National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress on Saturday received a former senator in Adamawa State, Abdulaziz Nyako, and other members of the African Democratic Congress; Senator Elisha Abbo, former Governor Bala Ngilari and Chief Emmanuel Bello into the APC. The chairman of the committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, represented by Prof Tahir Mamman, North-East representative in the committee, also said they had set a two million membership target for the state chapter of the party. Buni explained that with two million registered members in the state, any candidate who emerged from the party’s primary would be sure of victory at the polls. He added, “We want to see at least two million residents of Adamawa as registered members of the APC in the exercise.” Nyako said he observed the APC in the state had shown that it was reformed and could be trusted.
