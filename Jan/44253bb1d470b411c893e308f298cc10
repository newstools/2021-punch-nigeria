Segun Adewole The appeal division of the Kano State High Court has set aside the death sentence passed on Kano singer, Aminu Yahaya Sharif, for blasphemy. The court ordered a retrial of the case against Sharif who had filed an appeal to challenge the sentence. The judgment was delivered on Thursday by the State Chief Judge Nuraddeen Sagir on grounds that the lower courtâ€™s proceedings were characterised by irregularities. Sagir also ordered that Sharif should be granted full legal representation and that the case should be tried before different judge. READ ALSO: Buhari mourns ex-Super Eagles goalkeeper, Joe Erico
