Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt THE Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People has accused the Nigeria Police of disrupting its 2021 edition of the Ogoni Day celebration shcheduled for Monday in Bori, Khana LGA of Rivers State. MOSOP President, Lazarus Tamana, made the accusation while addressing journalists in Port Harcourt, the state capital on Monday. Tamana said, “Our Ogoni Day celebration this year was disrupted. It was disrupted by security forces especially the Nigeria Police. The Divisional Police Officer in-charge of Bori Division was there to ensure that the celebration did not hold. “It is supposed to be a full day event where Ogoni people have the opportunity to express themselves, but we were denied that this year by security forces. We applied duly for the use of the Braithwaite Memorial Grammar School and we had already started when the police took over the venue.” He insisted that the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project must follow all the recommendations of the United Nations Environment Programme report on Ogoniland published in August 2011, saying any deviation from the process of the implementation would amount to serious violation of the rights of Ogoni people. “In view of this, MOSOP will be demanding the roadmap for the implementation of the report that respects the rights of the communities,” he added. When contacted, Spokesman for the state Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, said he would contact the DPO of Bori Division and get back to our correspondent as at press time. Copyright PUNCH.
