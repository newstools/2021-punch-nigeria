Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A former deputy governor of Ekiti State, Chief Abiodun Aluko, has sued for peace and unity among members of the All Progressives Congress in the state to position it to win the forthcoming 2022 governorship election. Aluko also canvassed support for Governor Kayode Fayemi, for what he described as the governor’s achievements in all sectors of the economy and education. The former deputy governor, who spoke at his Ikere Ekiti home while hosting APC chieftains from parts of the state on Friday as part of activities marking his birthday celebration, said, “Unity is important to keep the government and as well place the party on the threshold of winning elections in years ahead. “My dear fellow party members, it is imperative that we stay together as a united family. In large platforms like ours, conflicts remain inevitable, but we must be patient, tolerant and make sacrifices to resolve such on time, as unity is cardinal to the existence of a formidable party.” Aluko, who reviewed the two years of the Fayemi administration in the state, scored it high in “restoring the values of decency, probity, accountability and integrity in governance”. He said, “Fayemi has demonstrated respect for the rights and choices of the people individually and in groups and as well preserved the independence of other institutions for a thriving democracy.” Copyright PUNCH.
