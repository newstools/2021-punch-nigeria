Joseph Olaoluwa Emirates Airlines has vowed to contest the judgement of a Federal High Court in Lagos which ordered it to pay $1.63m to a businessman, Orji Ikem. Ikem had accused the airline of losing his hand luggage, which went missing during his trip to China in 2007. According to a statement from the public relations firm for the carrier made available to our correspondent, Emirates said the it had filed an appeal in the matter. The statement said, “Emirates has already filed an appeal in this matter and we will be vigorously defending our position.” Ikem had accused the airline of losing two hand luggage containing personal effects and $700,000, as well as $930,000 in 18 bundles of $50,000 wraps each and $30,000 cash not in wrap. Justice Muslim Hassan who ruled in the case asked the airline to pay the missing money and N50m as general damages to Ikem for the ‘untold hardship and loss of earning’ he suffered for the missing luggage from 2007 till date.
