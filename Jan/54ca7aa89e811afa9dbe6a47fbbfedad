Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Police personnel from the ‘A’ Division, Ughelli, Delta State, on Saturday shot dead two armed robbery suspects just as one other escaped with bullet wounds in a gun duel after an attempt to rob some customers using a bank Automated Teller Machines around 3pm. It was gathered that the robbers, on sighting the policemen, opened fire, while the cops also shot back, felling two of the robbers, with one other escaping with bullet wounds. A police source said two locally-made pistols, lives cartridges, one expended cartridge and one red Volkswagen Golf 3 with number plate, AJ 220 EFR, were recovered. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, told journalists that operatives of the ‘A’ Division, Ughelli, received a distress call that some armed robbers were operating close to a new generation bank on the Market Road. According to the PPRO, the police on arriving at the scene, saw the robbers zooming off, but the cops gave them a chase and exchanged fire with them along Isoko Road, which resulted in the killing of two of the robbers, while the third escaped with bullet wounds. The PPRO said, “Investigation is ongoing and efforts are being intensified to arrest the fleeing suspect.” Recall  that last Wednesday, a gang of three armed robbers trailed a PoS operator in Ughelli from a new generation bank to his house on Uduere Street and shot him before making away with unspecified sum of money. In a similar development, a five-man gang of armed robbers in the Ughelli South Local Government Area were arrested by the police in collaboration with the local vigilante group, after robbing a PoS operator.
