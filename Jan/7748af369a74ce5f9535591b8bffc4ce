Researchers, in a report published in Nature Genetics on January 7, have revealed that identical twins may not be carbon copies at the DNA level. According to sciencenews.org, the researchers from Iceland noted that on average, identical twins differ by 5.2 genetic changes. “The finding is important because identical twins — also called monozygotic twins because they come from a single fertilised egg — are often studied to determine whether particular traits, diseases or conditions result from genetics or environmental influences. “Identical twins were thought to be genetically the same, so differences in their health were considered to be the product of their environment. The new finding suggests that some genetic changes could also account for differences between twins” the researchers wrote. The scientists deciphered the complete genetic makeup, or genome, of 381 pairs of identical twins. Of those, 38 pairs were genetic duplicates of each other, but most had some differences in DNA that probably arose very early in development, either just before one embryo split to form two or shortly after the split. Some of the twins had many genetic differences, including 39 pairs who had more than 100 changes between the twins. Patterns of mutations among twins suggest that embryos don’t split neatly when twins form, the findings suggest.
