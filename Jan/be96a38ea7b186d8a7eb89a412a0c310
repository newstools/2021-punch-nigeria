DAUD OLATUNJI The police in Ogun State have arrested three suspected members of Eiye Confraternity for threatening to kill one Teslim Lateef who refused initiation into their group. The suspects – Olajide Shittu, 32, Emmanuel Fidelis, 29, and Sunkanmi Ifelodun, 39 – were arrested following a report lodged at the Ajuwon Police Station. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday. Oyeyemi said Lateef reported that the three suspects had been threatening to kill him over his refusal to be initiated into Eiye Confraternity despite their persistent appeal to him. The PPRO said, “He stated further that they threatened to eliminate him since he has known them to be members of their group so that he will not expose them.’’ “On the strength of the report, the DPO Ajuwon division, SP Andrew Akinseye, who has been monitoring the suspects, led his men to their hideout where the three suspects were apprehended.  They have all confessed being members of the Eiye cult group and that they were trying to recruit more members into their fold.” The police spokesperson said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation.
