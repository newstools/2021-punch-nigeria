Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Rivers and four other states under the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Plc may be plunged into darkness following an industrial dispute that greeted the alleged sacking of 60 workers of the electricity company. This followed a resolution by the Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies Union, which insisted that the retrenchment did not follow due process. Our correspondent reports that the other three states are Bayelsa, Cross River and Akwa Ibom. The Assistant General Secretary of the association, Innocent Douglas, while speaking to journalists in Port Harcourt on Thursday, said the sacking affected workers in the four states. He said, “It is injurious to labour. We don’t accept what is happening. This is mass sacking; sacking of over 60 persons at a time. Mass sacking is against the labour movement.” Douglas said the association had demanded that the company reverse its decision or face an industrial action. Efforts to get the response of the PHED’s  acting Manager, Corporate Communications, Chioma Aninwe, proved abortive, as she did not respond to calls and a text message sent to her phone.
