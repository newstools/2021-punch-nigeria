Kayode Oyero A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has cautioned an Islamic group, the Muslim Solidarity Forum, to be mindful of its utterances against the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah. The PUNCH had reported that the Sokoto-based group asked Kukah to vacate the state or tender an apology over his comments on Islam. The acting Chairman of MSF, Prof Isa Maishanu, made this known in a statement in reaction to the cleric’s Christmas Message. Reacting, the former minister tweeted, “Bishop Hassan Kukah did not attack Islam & has nothing to apologise about. He has always sought for religious tolerance & peaceful co-existence between Christians & Muslims. Those that demand that he “must apologise” or “leave Sokoto” must mind their utterances & keep the peace. “If anyone can provide me with a video of Kukah calling for violence against Muslims or inciting people against Islam I will give him one million naira.” Kukah, in his December 25 message, had accused the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), of nepotism and failure to protect Nigerians. His message riled some nerves, especially in the camp of the pro-Buharists.

How come our region has become a cesspool of blood and death? Why did President Buhari hand over a majority of the plum jobs to Northern Muslims? Was it for efficacy and efficiency? What was the logic? President Buhari must pause and turn around because his policy of nepotism has been rejected by the gods.” Kukah’s message was delivered barely a month after the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, lamented the high rate of insecurity in the North, saying it was the worst place in the country to live.
