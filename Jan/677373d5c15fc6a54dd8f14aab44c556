Temiloluwa O’Peters The Bank of Industry has warned members of the public that the bank is not undertaking any recruitment, hence they should be wary of fraudsters This was disclosed in a statement by BoI’s management on Tuesday. The bank cautioned the general public to be wary of fraudulent advertisements and letters by recruitment agencies on a purported recruitment exercise by the bank. It said the letters requesting copies of national identity card, academic and professional certificates, among others, were false and emphasised that there was no recruitment in any form and in any part of the country or overseas. The statement said, “For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to state that BoI is not recruiting now and it has not asked any agency or organisation to recruit on its behalf. It also does not demand payment in any form for job placement. “Anyone who entertains such invitations or deals with the fraudsters does so at his or her own risk.” The bank restated its priority for the support of micro, small and medium enterprises to stimulate national economic recovery and growth.
