Tony Okafor, Awka A former Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, Valentine Ozigbo, on Sunday urged Anambra State voters to elect someone in the class of ex-Governor, Peter Obi, in the forthcoming governorship election scheduled for November. Ozigbo, who is aspiring to fly the flag of the Peoples Democratic Party in the forthcoming polls said, “Peter Obi left Anambra on a positive trajectory with various sums left in many banks which have been validated by many sources.
“But today, Anambra is in such a debt that one starts to wonder how the state government is where it is now. “With the way things are moving, Anambra will soon be left out in the comity of economically-viable states in the near future. That is why my mission is very apt.” Ozigbo said this in an interview with journalists, in Awka. He said, “We cannot afford another mistake of enthroning incompetence after such underperformance. “Anambra today is a shadow of what it used to be. Obiano has done his best but whether his best is good enough, it is for the people to judge. “I have moved around the state and observed serious infrastructural decay, poor waste management, lack of access to basic amenities and so on. “More worrisome is the rising debt profile of Anambra State despite the poor performance of the government.”
