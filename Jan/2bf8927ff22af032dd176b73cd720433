CHIDIEBUBE OKEOMA A lecturer at the Imo State University, Owerri, Emma Ogueri, has been abducted by some gunmen at a pharmacy opposite All Seasons Hotel located at new Owerri, Imo State. Ogueri, a lecturer at the Faculty of Social Science, was said to be hanging out with friends at a nearby relaxation centre on Friday and had gone to the pharmacy to buy medicine when he was kidnapped. The victim, a native of Eziama in the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of the state was whisked away by his abductors allegedly dressed in police uniform. A source told our correspondent that the victim was beaten before he was taken away in a waiting vehicle.
