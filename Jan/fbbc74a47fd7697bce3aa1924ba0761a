Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Presidency has been advised against the planned arrest of Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho. The National President of Yoruba Youth Socio-Cultural Association, Olalekan Hammed, who said this in an interview with our correspondent said arresting Igboho will trigger a crisis in the area. He said Igboho offered to do what security agencies had not been able to do for the people, saying many indigenes of the land had been maimed and killed for so long by herdsmen.

He said, “Ibarapa youths may react violently if Sunday Igboho is arrested. They will also lose hope in both the federal and the state government. “Ibarapa and other communities across Yoruba land seriously need to be guaranteed safety. So, any attempt to arrest Igboho will make the people think the government wants the menace of bandits in their communities to continue.” He said the police should not arrest Igboho because he did not ask Fulani to leave Yorubaland but criminals. He added, “The President’s body language which is boosting criminal herders’ moral has already pushed the entire country in a state of anarchy.” READ ALSO: Ikpeazu dissolves cabinet, recalls suspended CoS
