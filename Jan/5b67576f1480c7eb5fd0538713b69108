Sodiq Oyeleke A woman who was shot during the unrest that erupted Wednesday afternoon at the United States Capitol has been pronounced dead. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department, Dustin Sternbeck, confirmed this in an interview with CNN monitored by our correspondent. “Yes, the adult female that was shot inside of the Capitol was pronounced at an area hospital. Additional details will be forthcoming as this remains an active MPD investigation,” Sternbeck added. The PUNCH  had reported that a person was shot and wounded inside the US Capitol amid chaotic scenes in Washington as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the building in anger over his election defeat. “One shooting victim was transported from the Capitol,” a person attached to an emergency response unit told AFP, adding that there were “other injuries” in the chaotic protests and that the situation remained fluid. The Washington Post reported that police said the victim was a white female shot in the shoulder. Also, there are reports that a 24-year-old male who was climbing the scaffolding on the west front of the US Capitol building fell more than 30 feet. According to reports, he has been taken to the hospital but in critical condition. Donald Trump’s supporters had stormed a session of Congress held Wednesday to certify Joe Biden’s election win, triggering unprecedented chaos and violence at the heart of American democracy and accusations the president was attempting a coup. Hours after an extraordinary rally by Trump seeking to overturn the election, a flag-waving mob broke down barricades outside the Capitol and swarmed inside, rampaging through offices and onto the usually solemn legislative floors. Many were also injured inside the Capitol, an emergency responder said, with lawmakers evacuated and handed gas masks as police fired tear gas.
