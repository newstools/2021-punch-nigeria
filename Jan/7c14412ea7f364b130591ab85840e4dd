Deji Lambo The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered investigation into the sacking of a female corporal, Olajide Omolola, over pregnancy out of wedlock. Adamu disclosed this on Wednesday while inaugurating a project at the SPOs Quarters on Oba Aladejobi Street, in the Ikeja GRA, Lagos State. While fielding questions from journalists at the event, the IG said the police would investigate the dismissal. He said, “Let us do our own investigation and find out because whatever I say must be authoritative.” PUNCH Metro had reported that Omolola, who was attached to the Ekiti State Police Command, was sacked for getting pregnant when she was not married. The police reportedly relied on an Act that had been repealed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
