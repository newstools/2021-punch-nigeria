Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebele and Anyi Chuks Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, says it has built about 110 houses for poor natives in Ebonyi State. The organisation also said it planned to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor in the country in the course of extending its humanitarian services to the poor. The Founder of the organisation, Dr Ifeanyichukwu Odii, stated this on Friday at Isuechara community, in the Onicha Local Government Area of the state, while distributing food materials, cash gifts, amongst others, to indigent natives, across the 13 Local Government Areas in Ebonyi. He said, “The foundation has been assisting the needy and empowering people for over 15 years and was motivated by God’s selflessness in sacrificing his only son to save mankind. “We have built 77 houses for indigent persons, six churches to assist in propagating God’s word and a palace for the tradition ruler of the area. “We have added another 23 houses to the 77 houses we built and they would soon be handed over to the beneficiaries in the course of this month.” The Coordinator of Ebele and Anyi Chuks Foundation in Ebonyi State, Mr Christian Onu, said the organisation’s staff were motivated by the zeal shown by the founder and his wife, Ebele, to assist humanity.
