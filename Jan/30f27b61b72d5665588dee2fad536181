Sodiq Oyeleke Sahara Reporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore, and four other activists have been arraigned before
a Magistrate’s Court in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja, on Monday. They were earlier arrested for holding a protest against bad governance on New Year’s Eve in Abuja and subsequently taken to a police unit infamously known as ‘Abattoir’ in the Lokogoma area of the FCT. The PUNCH gathered that Sowore and other activists were arraigned on three charges of criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and attempting to incite others. The activists, however, denied the charges. “We are currently at the Magistrate court n Wuse Zone 2 with a broken nose. Police want us sent to prison after five days in cruel detention. “Just rest assured we are solid and undaunted until full liberation is attained! # RevolutionNow,” Sowore tweeted on Monday. Sowore had before his arrest sent out a series of tweets calling on Nigerians to join him on a protest against the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). He had tweeted, “How about a crossover protest/uprising tonight? Anyone willing to participate? Pick up a candle and a placard showing your grievances against the regime; let’s upload our short videos and photos across our social media platforms. Let’s welcome the regime to a resolute 2021! “#CrossoverWithProtest against tyrant @mbuhari’s regime, candlelight for #LekkiMassacre; a placard for #EndBadGovernment; procession to usher in #Revolutionary 2021, a fist for victims of repression-frozen bank accounts, malicious prosecution and detention of #Endsars activists. “#Crossoverwithprotest starts at 11.30 till 12.30 am across Nigeria, a candle, a placard and fireworks to usher in a RESOLUTE 2021 in Nigeria!
