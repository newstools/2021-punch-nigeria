Dayo Ojerinde The Director-General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, has warned Nigerians not to take any vaccine except the ones approved by the agency. Adeyeye, at a briefing on Friday, said the World Health Organisation’s approval was not enough for the use of the vaccine, except the regulatory agency certifies the vaccine safe for use.

WHO is not a regulatory agency that will approve and say use, they are there to guide and give regulatory agencies more confidence. “If a product is already on WHO emergency use listing, the regulatory agency will still look at the application. That doesn’t mean we just pass it like that, we will have to read it within the context of our environment. No vaccine or commodity can be used unless it passes through NAFDAC in Nigeria.
