Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has shut down Airport Bridge at Toyota on the Oshodi-Isolo Expressway over a recent tanker fire that affected the bridge. The state Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, in a statement he personally signed on Sunday, said the closure of the bridge to vehicular movement was to enable the government to conduct structural engineering tests on the bridge. He noted that alternative routes had been created for motorists pending the outcome of the tests and the reopening of the bridge to traffic. According to Oladeinde, motorists from Mile 2 to Cele on Apapa-Oshodi Expressway will make use of Aiye and Osolo Way to Asa Afariogun through 7&8 to access International Airport Road. The commissioner explained that motorists from Toyota would use the service lanes by Armed Forces Resettlement Centre to BOC Gases on old NAFDAC Headquarters.
