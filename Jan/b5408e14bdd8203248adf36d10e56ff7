Umar Muhammed, Lafia NASARAWA State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has threatened to take punitive measures against any citizen of the state who tries to violate the State Harmonisation and Administration of Revenue Law, 2020 in the state. Consequently, the governor said when he came in 2019, some citizen of the state asked him about the state of the revenue, adding that he could not respond to their question because he was new and was not prepare.

He said the state government had commenced the implementation of the State Harmonisation and Administration of Revenue Law, 2020 with a view to checkmating financial leakages. His words, “I will not spare anybody in the state trying to violate the revenue law. I came in as JJC (new) governor in 2019 and I was not prepare to respond to any question then,” he stated. Sule, therefore, affirmed that with full commencement of the law, henceforth, collection of taxes and revenues accruable to the state would be harmonised and centralised in the state revenue service. He added, “The collection of revenue and sharing must be done in transparent way. We will also be truthful and honest so that everybody can get his share from the remittance of the revenue. We must obey the law for the betterment of the state,” he warned the citizens.
