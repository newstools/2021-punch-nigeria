For one, no sports day, which is a pity because school is all about relationship. No assembly so that we don’t all come into one place.” The Commissioner who visited the schools with a quality assurance team promised that the visit will be on a regular basis. She said, “That means we are not going to leave the schools alone. We are going to keep coming around, holding meetings, talking to them and encouraging them.” READ ALSO: Partial compliance with Covid protocols as Ogun schools resume On the issue of face masks, Adefisayo admitted that they are uncomfortable but advised the students to keep wearing one to protect themselves She said, “I know they find it uncomfortable.
