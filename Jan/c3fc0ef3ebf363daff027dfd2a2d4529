Afeez Hanafi Four policemen serving at the Lagos State Police Command are undergoing orderly room trial for allegedly extorting money from a 16-year-old student in the Isheri area of the state. The cops identified as inspectors are Emmanuel Michael, 40; Sunday Odubiyi, 40; Lawrence Amedu, 39, and Aroye Dickson, 40. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, disclosed on Friday in a statement that the policemen allegedly harassed and extorted N70,000 from the student identified simply as Segun on January 18, 2021, at NGAB Junction, Isheri, in a Toyota Corolla car. He said the picture of the policemen caught in the act went viral on social media and caught the attention of the Complaint Response Unit of the Force to track the officers for necessary action. Adejobi stated, “The matter was subsequently referred to the Lagos State Police Command for further action. After due interrogation, the policemen confessed to the crime and refunded the N70,000 to the student, on bond, which forms the key credible evidence/exhibit in the case. “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has condemned the act of the police inspectors which is detrimental to the image of the police force and counterproductive to the ongoing reform agenda of the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Abubakar Adamu. He (Odumosu) has however ordered for the orderly room trial of the inspectors with immediate effect to serve as a deterrent to other criminally-minded police personnel in the command and beyond.” Copyright PUNCH.
