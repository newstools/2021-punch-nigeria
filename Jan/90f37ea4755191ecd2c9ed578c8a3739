Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Some gunmen in the early hours of Wednesday invaded Garu village in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing two persons. The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, who confirmed the attack, identified the victims as Aliyu Daiyabu and Safiyanu Muhammad. He, however, noted that troops of the Operation Thunder Strike had continued with their offensives against the bandits. According to him, an operational feedback to the Kaduna State Government revealed that the troops conducted clearance patrols to Napayako and Dajin Wuya, during which several bandit camps were destroyed. “The patrol followed an earlier attack by bandits on hunters in the forest, when two hunters were left with gunshot wounds. “During the clearance operation, the troops mobilised to the location with some hunters who escaped the prior attack. While the camps were dislodged, one of the wounded hunters, Yohanna Yakubu, was found. The other hunter, Isuwa Tanko, was eventually confirmed dead,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
