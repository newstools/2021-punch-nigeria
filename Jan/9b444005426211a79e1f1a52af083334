Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The media aide to former governor of Imo state, Rochas Okorocha, Sam Onwuemeodo, has explained that his principal was absent from the South East zonal stakeholders meeting of the All Progressives Congress held in the Imo Government House, Owerri, because it was a “political jamboree.” Onwuemeodo, said this in an interview with our correspondent, in Owerri, on Thursday. He accused the state Governor Hope Uzodimma of de-marketing the APC. In response to a question, Onwuemeodo asked, “How many people did you see at the meeting? How many House of Reps members were there? Did you see Senator Rochas Okorocha, Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu and other leaders of the party there? “It is almost one year since Hope Uzodinma became governor and he has not called any APC leadership meeting in Imo state. At the appropriate time, we will separate truth from falsehood. That meeting was a political jamboree. “All those who brought APC to South East were not there and you called it APC stakeholders meeting? We challenge them to bring the 2015 and 2019 booth results. Okorocha had produced Senators, Reps members and House of Assembly members for APC.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
