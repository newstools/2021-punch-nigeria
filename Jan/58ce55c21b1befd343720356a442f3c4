Gibson Achonu, Owerri The Media aide to former Imo State Governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha, Sam Onwuemeodo, has urged Governor Hope Uzodimma and his aides to stop blaming his principal’s administration for their failures. He made the appeal in an interview in Owerri, on Tuesday. He said, “The blame game should have been over after the celebration of his 100 days in office. But it has continued, even after one year indicating that there is no light at the end of the tunnel. “The Governor and his media disciples ought to have known by now that the blame game or passing the buck has become old school, belated or eccentric with regard to administration.” He noted that if after one year, all Uzodimma’s aides could talk about was what Okorocha did or did not do as defence for their principals’ manifest failure, then there was something fundamentally wrong. He said, “In celebrating his own one year in office, Okorocha did not blame those who had been governor before him, including His Excellencies, Chiefs Achike Udenwa and Ikedi Ohakim.” When contacted, one of Uzodinma’s aides, Modestus Nwankpa said, “I can describe Uzodimma as a physician who came to cure the state from its old existing sickness. For instance, Uzodimma is correcting the substandard roads which Okorocha did. Presently, he is weeding out the high level of corruption which formed a major part of his former administration.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
