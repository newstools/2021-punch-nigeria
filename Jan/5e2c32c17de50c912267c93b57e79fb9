Peter Dada, Akure The Chief Medical Director of the University of Medical Science Teaching Hospital, Akure, Dr Oluwole Ige, has identified the paucity of fund as the major challenge facing the hospital. He, however, noted that the management of the hospital had partnered the private sector to solve the challenge, saying the government could not meet all the needs of the hospital. Speaking at the inauguration of the new initiative of the hospital, called ‘Health-wise Foundation’ which was developed in collaboration with a public relations firm, XMedia Group, Lagos, Ige stated that the aim of the hospital was to provide quality health care to the people. According to him, the partnership with the PR firm will help the hospital to step up its technology-driven capacity to enhance its service delivery to the people. He said, “We want everybody to have the belief that UNIMEDTH is there for them. We are moving towards earning more income apart from the usual government subvention. The government subvention can’t sustain us. It is not because the government is not trying its best but we can’t put everything on government alone. “We want to make patients the ultimate and ahead of everything we do in this hospital such that their experience will be palatable. “We want everybody in this environment to know that when they have health issues, all they need to do is to get to UNIMEDTH and their problems will be solved.” The representative of the Xmedia Group, Mr Tunde Lawrenson, said the collaboration would address the problem of funding in the state’s health sector.
