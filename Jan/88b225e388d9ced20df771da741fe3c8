Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, on Friday, described a former governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha as “an internally displaced politician”.

Okorocha said that APC was no longer breathing in the state since Uzodinma became the governor of the state. Reacting, Uzodinma, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Print Media, Modestus Nwamkpa, said Okorocha was working to destroy the APC before he joins another party.

The governor’s aide said, “Okorocha is a sinking man. He is an internally displaced politician. He is angry that under Governor Hope Uzodinma, APC is gaining more grounds in the South East, including the entry of Governor Dave Umahi into the party.

Okorocha ruled Imo State for eight years with small boys and did what he liked with the state. “Throughout Okorocha’s reign as governor, he never called any stakeholders meeting for APC but Governor Hope Uzodinma in less than one year has been strengthening APC in the state and in the entire region.” Nwamkpa said Okorocha can leave the party quietly and not make bogus claims.
