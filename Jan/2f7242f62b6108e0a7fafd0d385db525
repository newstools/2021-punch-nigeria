CHIMA AZUBUIKE The head of the Yoruba community in Gombe State, Oba Abdulrahim Yusuf, has called on Governor Inuwa Yahaya to consider the ethnic group in the formation of his cabinet. Yusuf, who stated this in his New Year address on Saturday, however commended the governor for appointing an Igbo man as a senior special adviser on community relations. The monarch said, “This is a clear display of good leadership with high inkling for inclusivity. It is good and well-taken. The governor will do well and better too if he could also consider a Yoruba man for a political post. “We have many of them in Gombe. As we have many journalists, we have artisans, businessmen and intellectuals for such consideration.” The monarch, who hails from Ogbomosho in Oyo State, said the Yoruba community had been in the state for over 100 years, adding that his grandfather lived and died in Gombe.
