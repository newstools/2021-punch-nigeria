Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has congratulated the Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC) on the appointment of Oyo State-born Revd. Israel Akanji, as the new president of the convention. The governor, who equally lauded the immediate past president, Rev. Supo Ayokunle, for the progress recorded by the NBC under his leadership, urged Akanji to take the NBC to greater heights. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa, quoted the governor as expressing confidence in the president-elect of the NBC, noting that he had no doubt that the NBC would make greater exploits under his leadership. The statement reads partly “I congratulate the entire Baptist family across Oyo State and Nigeria on the appointment of Dr Israel Akanji as the new president of the Nigerian Baptist Convention. “I, particularly, congratulate my brother, Rev. Akanji, who has always been a great ambassador of Oyo State in God’s vineyard. “This appointment is a testimony to the goodness of God in his life and how far he has come. I have no doubt that he will take NBC to greater heights, building on the great progress achieved by our father, the CAN president and immediate past NBC president, His Eminence, Revd. Dr. Supo Ayokunle.”
