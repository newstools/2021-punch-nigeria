Adeyinka Adedipe , Benin Ten suspected kidnappers and armed robbers have reportedly escaped from detention at the State Criminal Investigation Department in Benin, causing panic in the Edo State capital. Although details are still sketchy, sources said some policemen, who might have aided the escape of the criminals had been arrested on the orders of the Commissioner of Police, Kokumo Johnson, and expected to face orderly room trial. Recall that some inmates recently escaped from the Sapele and Oko correctionak centres after hoodlums hijacked the #EndSARS protest last year and  had held the state by its jugular. The police promised to issue a statement on Sunday on the latest escape, but none came as of press time. A resident, Oboh Beatrice, who expressed shock, said, “This is a very serious issue that must not be swept under the carpet.” Another resident, who did not want his name in prints, said the escape should be thoroughly investigated and anyone found culpable should be brought to book.
