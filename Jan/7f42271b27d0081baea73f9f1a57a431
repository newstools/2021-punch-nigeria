Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The governorship campaign posters of former Ekiti State Governor, Chief Segun Oni, on Monday flooded strategic locations across Ado Ekiti. The posters, bearing the logo of the People Democratic Party, also had bold inscriptions of ‘Segun Oni for Governor, for a greater tomorrow’. Communities and locations where the posters signed by a group known as Ekiti PDP Progressives, were visible included Ikere Ekiti, Ifaki Ekiti and Ajilosun, Basiri, Ijigbo, Ilawe Road and Okeyinmi areas of Ado Ekiti. Recall that Oni, a former Deputy National Chairman (South) of All Progressives Congress, returned to the PDP last year and has indicated interest in the gubernatorial poll scheduled to hold mid-2022. A member of the media team of Oni’s political platform, ‘Atunse Ekiti’, Dr Bayo Arowolaju, said, “Well, as an insider in Atunse Ekiti group, I know that Segun Oni has not formally declared his intention for the plum seat, but there are agitations from groups and individuals. “These posters, to us, are just a call that the right person should be allowed to govern the state for the people to feel the dividends of democracy. “Ekiti people are beginning to see and appreciate how Segun Oni managed the lean resources of our dear state to build road Infrastructure, construct one storey buildings in primary schools, employ over 6,000 civil servants, revamped Ikun Dairy Farm, ROMACO and other moribund state-owned firms.” Copyright PUNCH.
