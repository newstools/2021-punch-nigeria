Grace Edema and Adebayo Ayinde FOLLOWING requests by candidates to be given more time to complete their registration process for the 2020 SSCE (External), the National Examinations Council has fixed new dates for the examination. This was as the Council promised to come out with measures that would be put in place to protect candidates and exam officials from contracting COVID-19 while sitting for the exam. In a statement by Head, Information and Public Relations Division of the board, Azeez Sani, indicated that the examination, which was earlier scheduled to commence on Monday, February 1, 2021, and end on Wednesday March 3, 2021, will now start on Monday February 8, 2021, and end on Wednesday, March 8, 2021. The Council also informed candidates, who missed some papers during the 2020 SSCE (Internal) due to the EndSARS protests in some states, to take note of the new dates and report for the examination accordingly at their various examination centres to be designated. In an interview with one of our correspondents, Sani explained that the Council was aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and would soon roll out guidelines to ensure everybody at exam venues was protected. When asked if NECO would observe COVID-19 protocols during the exam, Sani said, “The Council will soon roll out guidelines for the exam in the context of COVID-19. In few days, we will come up with the guidelines.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
