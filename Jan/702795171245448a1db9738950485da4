When she came here from India at the age of 19, she maybe didn’t quite imagine this moment but she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible and so I am thinking about her. In her tribute, the Vice President-elect recognised American women of all races and acknowledged the key roles women have played in the history of America. Harris said, “I am thinking about the generations of women; Black women, Asian women, White, Latina, Native American women, who throughout our nation’s history have paved the way for this moment. Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality, liberty and justice for all. Including the Black women who are often, too often, overlooked but so often prove they are the backbone of our democracy.

I reflect on their struggle, their determination, and the strength of their vision, to see what can be, unburdened by what was been. And I stand on their shoulders.”
