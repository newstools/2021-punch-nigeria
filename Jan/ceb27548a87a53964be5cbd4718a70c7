Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Defence Headquarters has said Boko Haram insurgents are targeting and attacking local communities in the North-East because the military is dominating the counter-insurgency war. The military also said that troops had been carrying out aggressive patrol backed by intelligence obtained through constant air reconnaissance by the Nigerian Air Force. The terrorists have reportedly scaled up their attacks on vulnerable communities lately, but the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, promised that the troops would improve on their tactics. He stated this in Abuja on Thursday during the weekly briefing on internal security operations by the armed forces. Enenche stated, “The surveillance that we maintained through air reconnaissance and intelligence is at the peak in the North and the aggressive patrol of the land forces has made it possible for them (insurgents) to focus more on soft targets. We are going to ensure that this is improved upon on regular basis.” Enenche explained that the military had decimated innumerable bandits in the North-West, adding that the residents had been providing credible intelligence which had assisted the troops. “Information kept coming in, that is the interesting thing about the North-West. They (residents) will tell us where they (bandits) are and when you go there, you will actually see them, and then they are being decimated. I can tell you that we are at the stage of domination now; dominating the whole area, so that is quite encouraging,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
