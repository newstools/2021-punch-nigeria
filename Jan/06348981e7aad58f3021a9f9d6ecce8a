Sodiq Oyeleke The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), says insecurity is having an adverse effect on the economic growth of Nigeria. He said this in his New Year speech, a copy of which was obtained by our correspondent on Friday. The president, who described insecurity as a challenge, decried violence in the country. He said insecurity is setting Nigeria back at “critical points” through the destruction of public and private investments. According to him, the nation is on a difficult journey to nationhood and greatness.
