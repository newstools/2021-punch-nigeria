Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Government has welcomed the first baby born in 2021. The first baby of the year in the state was given birth to at the General Hospital, Mushin at 2.38am with a 4.35kg weight. The state Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, at the General Hospital Igando, said the baby of the Year programme was a symbolic event. Abayomi, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr. Olusegun Ogboye, said, “For us in the Ministry of Health, the First Baby of the Year is a symbolic event. As a state, the very first activity of the government every year is seen to focus on health care. Its significance is demonstrated by the priority it is given, with the visit of the wife of our Governor and the many important dignitaries, who could have been elsewhere, but have chosen to spend their first few hours of the new year here in our public hospitals. They make it a duty to be here to rejoice with our mothers on the birth of their children and that, in itself, speaks volumes. “It is worth stating that the Ministry of Health is saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that our residents have access to services that promote health and wellbeing. And part of its obligations is to strengthen structures, improve programmes and expand services that help reduce neonatal and infant mortality and ensure safe motherhood. As such, events like this give our dignitaries the chance to evaluate where we are, as against the year before and recognise opportunities to create partnerships that can further improve service outcomes.”
