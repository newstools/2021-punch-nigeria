Oladimeji Ramon The All Progressives Congress says it has set up a panel to probe its loss in the last governorship election in Edo State. Governor Godwin Obaseki, who defected from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party, defeated the APC candidate, Ize Iyamu, in the governorship poll. The APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee disclosed on Friday that the party had set up a panel to probe its loss. In a New Year message by its National Secretary, Senator John Udoedehe, the APC CECPC noted that the probe panel was set on its advice to the party. Udoedehe said, “In the course of the year, since the beginning of the tenure of CECPC, we have led the party into major elections, such as governorship, National Assembly and state Assembly elections. In these elections, the party did once again prove that it is the party to reckon with in the country with significant wins across the board. “A win in the Ondo State gubernatorial election despite the mass gang-up against the party, the senatorial seats won across Lagos, Plateau and other states as well as the good number of state Houses of Assembly won are parts of the CECPC fears for the year under review. “It must be noted that a committee has also been set up to advise the party National Secretariat on what led to the defeat in Edo State and what actions need to be taken to prevent a recurrence in the future.” Copyright PUNCH.
