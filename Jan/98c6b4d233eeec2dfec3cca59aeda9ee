Matthew Ochei, Asaba A Federal High court sitting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, on Thursday fixed February 15, 2021 for hearing of the suit filed by a coalition of 10 political parties seeking to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission to include them on the ballot ahead of the local government scheduled for March 6, 2021. The plaintiffs were among the over 60 political parties deregistered by INEC on February 6, 2020. The affected parties are the plaintiffs, while INEC and the Delta State Independent Electoral Commission are the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively. However, the Change Advocacy Party, Alliance of Social Democrats, the Advance Congress of Democrats and others in Delta state had filed a suit before the Federal High Court in Asaba seeking to compel INEC to relist them into the ballot as ordered by the Appeal Court. During Thursday’s hearing, the lawyer to the plaintiffs, Mr. Kelechi Nnadi appealed to the court for more time to study and respond to the counter-affidavit served on his clients by the defendants. He said, “Today, we have asked the court to give us more time to study and respond to their counter-affidavit. “The document was served to us late yesterday (Wednesday), so we need time to study their arguments contained and respond appropriately.” In his ruling, Justice T.B Adegoke granted the application of the counsel to the plaintiffs and adjourned hearing on the matter to February 15, 2021.
