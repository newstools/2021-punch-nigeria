This was contained in a statement titled, “APC Congratulates Chief Bisi Akande on 82nd Birthday,” signed by the APC National Secretary, Senator John Akpan Udoedeghe, in Abuja, on Saturday. It read in part, “ The APC owes a great deal of appreciation to Akande for his pivotal and progressive leadership which laid the foundation for our electoral victories in the 2015 general election, most significantly the historic election of President Muhammadu Buhari which unseated an incumbent president for the first time in an election in Nigeria. “The APC joins family members, friends and associates in congratulating Akande on the laudable achievements he has recorded in his private and public life. “An elder statesman, grassroots politician, astute administrator and staunch advocate of progressive politics and governance, the APC is proud to note that Akande’s many achievements is as a result of his sincerity of purpose and personal sacrifices he has exhibited in positions of authority he has occupied at state, national and party levels.“ The party said Akande had remained a father figure in the polity and a unifier in times when the APC needed a voice of reason to settle its differences. It prayed for long life and continuous good health for the party leader as he continues to contribute to the growth of the country and party. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
