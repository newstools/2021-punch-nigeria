Tony Okafor, Awka The Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, has enjoined governorship aspirants in state election scheduled for November 6 to stop attacking him in their campaigns. He implored them to market their work plans devoid of vulgar statements and personal attacks. Obiano, who was elected on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, will conclude his second tenure in office on March 17, 2022. Most governorship candidates in the opposition parties have been vilifying the governor, accusing him of under developing the state and piling up a high debt burden on the state. But in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C-Don Adinuba, on Thursday, Obiano admonished opposition parties to go about their campaigns with decorum. He said, “Anambra State will not wish to return to the era where a sitting governor would be kidnapped and the party forged his letter of resignation. “The party that carried out the infamous mayhem of burning down the House of Assembly Complex including the Governor’s Lodge in Onitsha coupled with the Government House Awka, the Judiciary, the Anambra Broadcasting Service complex and a host of other public buildings, does not have the moral justification to rule the state again.” “The party that falsified election results and engaged in the most unconscionable looting called the Irrevocable Payment Standing Orders through which a handful of contractors were allegedly paid regardless of the job they did or did not do will not rule the state again.” Copyright PUNCH.
