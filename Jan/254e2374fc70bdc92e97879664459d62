Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The River State chapter of the Labour Party, has urged Governor Nyesom Wike, to invest the N78bn refund from the Federal Government in agriculture and the establishment of industries. This is coming barely a week after the governor confirmed receiving the refunds for the construction of federal roads in the state. The State LP Chairman, Prince Favour, who made the call during an interview with journalists, in Port Harcourt, on Sunday said, “This money should be channeled in improving Agriculture in Rivers State. Rivers State needs industries and a vibrant education system. “I want to plead with the governor that this is the opportunity for him to set the records straight. This is the opportunity for him to put a legacy that the world and the people of Rivers State will never forget by creating jobs through agriculture. “He (the governor) should revamp the Songhai Farms, revamp the Buguma fish farm and also revamp the Banana plantation. “I want to plead with him that these are the things (areas) he should focus this money on. The money should not be given to his aides, but people that are professional should be hired to manage this money and invest it in agriculture,” the labour party chairman said.
