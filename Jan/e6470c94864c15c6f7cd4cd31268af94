Joseph Olaoluwa Lufthansa has specified the type of face masks that passengers on its flights are allowed to wear while flying with the airline from February 1. In a press statement titled ‘Adjustment of the facemask obligation as of February 1’, the company asked customers to use only FFP2, KN95 and N95 standard face masks or surgical masks. In the travel advisory issued on Monday on its website, it said masks made with fabric would no longer be permitted. Part of the statement read, “Lufthansa is adapting the obligation to wear mouth-nose covers while travelling. From 1 February 2021, only face masks of the following standards will be permitted on flights to and from Germany: FFP2, KN95 and N95 standard or surgical masks. “These have to be worn during boarding, onboard and when leaving the aircraft. Masks made of fabric will no longer be permitted, visors and masks with valves have been permitted already. “Thus, in order to protect the health of all passengers and employees, the Lufthansa Group Airlines are taking up the regulation the German federal states have issued on 19 January 2021.” It, however, stated that exceptions to this regulation could still be made for health reasons. It explained that an exception would only be accepted if the passenger could present a current (not older than 48 hours) negative COVID-19 test result in connection with a medical certificate on the Lufthansa Group form.
