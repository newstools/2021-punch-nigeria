Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Peoples Democratic Party factional Chairman in Ekiti State, Bisi Kolawole, on Saturday, charged the party executives at all levels to embark on an aggressive membership drive for the party to be well-positioned to take control of the state from the All Progressives Congress in 2022 governorship election. Kolawole said aggressive membership drive, strategising for victory in the poll, and unity were necessary to strengthen the party and make it formidable. The PDP leader, who spoke in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, during a meeting held by the PDP factional State Secretary, Mrs Funmilayo Ogun, with the 16 local government and 155 ward secretaries of the party, urged the scribes “to forget the style of the past and begin mobilising for the party ahead of 2022 governorship election in earnest. “The ward secretaries should be responsible, know what they are doing, and always listen to the leadership of the party. Wining Ekiti back in 2022 is dear to our hearts in PDP and you have critical roles to play for us to actualise this,” he said. Ogun, a former Commissioner for Works, said she called the meeting to charge the ward and local government secretaries on how best to perform their duties as opposition party’s scribe and to let them know they should not work at cross purposes with their chairmen. She urged the secretaries, “You must ensure that the implementation of the decisions and directives of the party are strictly adhered to. Ensure that all units of the party carry out their duties promptly. This is the best way to operate as an opposition party. “Secretaries cannot do anything without the permission of chairmen. The party’s scribes at local governments and wards should be ready to carry out other duties that may be assigned to them in a manner that will make our party stronger in the eye of the public,” she said.
