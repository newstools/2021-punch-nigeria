Tony Okafor The Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, has pardoned and reinstated three suspended traditional rulers in the state to commemorate the new year. The three monarchs were among the 13 traditional rulerâ€™s suspended in office for travelling to Abuja with an oil mogul, Arthur Eze, to see the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), without state government approval. The state government had, in December, dethroned three of the monarchs by withdrawing their certificates of recognition, while the suspension on five were lifted. But on Friday, the Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Greg Obi, in a public service announcement, said, in the spirit of the New Year, Obiano had pardoned the monarchs whose reign was in abeyance.
