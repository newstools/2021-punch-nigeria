Samson Folarin Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has asked members of the state judiciary to exemplify equity, fairness and integrity in all their dealings. He said his administration would continue to accord them necessary supports in the discharge of their duties. A statement on Wednesday said Sanwo-Olu spoke during the swearing in of a Deputy Chief Registrar (Special Duties), Lagos division, Mrs Olubukola Aigbokhaevbo; and a legal practitioner, Mr Rahman Oshodi, as High Court judges in the state. Sanwo-Olu said the judges earned their nominations and appointments based on their credentials and experience in their respective areas of engagement. “I want the new justices to use this opportunity to reassure our citizens and the judiciary that they would continue to remain an example of equity and fairness, doing their work with integrity at the highest level,” he added. Speaking earlier, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo, said the newly appointed judges were the two that top the selection process. The Chief Judge of Lagos, Kazeem Alogba, informed the governor that seven judges would retire this year, stressing the need for their replacement. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
