Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A former Bayelsa State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Daniel Iworiso-Markson, has congratulated the immediate past governor of the state, Mr Seriake Dickson, on his 55th birthday on January 28. In a goodwill message on Wednesday, Iworiso-Markson described Dickson, who is currently the senator representing Bayelsa West, as “a man loved by God”, going by the many battles he had fought and won. He said Dickson’s meteoric rise to prominence from a very humble background could only be attributed to an unusual divine arrangement. Iworiso-Markson noted that Dickson is an excellent statesman who had distinguished himself at different levels of leadership, adding that his tenure as governor of Bayelsa was outstanding. He praised the senator for “the massive development Bayelsa witnessed during his tenure and for courageously standing as a strong voice for the Ijaw nation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
