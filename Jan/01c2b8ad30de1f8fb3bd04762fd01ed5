Kayode Oyero The United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation has appealed to members of the public to furnish it with vital information that would lead to the arrest of persons who instigated Wednesday’s Capitol riots in Washington. It said, “The FBI is seeking to identify individuals instigating violence in Washington, D.C. We are accepting tips and digital media depicting rioting or violence in and around the U.S. Capitol on January 6.” The FBI urged persons with important details on the perpetrators to submit such on http://fbi.gov/USCapitol. Supporters of incumbent President Donald Trump had invaded Capitol during a joint session of Congress held to certify the electoral victory of President-elect Joe Biden. The Capitol violence, hours after an extraordinary rally by Trump challenging his defeat, saw flag-waving backers break down barricades outside the Capitol and swarm inside, sending the legislative sessions into an emergency recess. Four persons have been pronounced dead while scores were reportedly injured. Congress leaders, however, reconvened after the riot and affirmed Biden’s Electoral College victory over Trump. Political leaders across all continents have condemned Trump’s action, with many accusing him of dragging one of the world’s most respected and resilient democracy in the mud.
