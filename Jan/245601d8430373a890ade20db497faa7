Raphael Ede, Enugu The Indigenous People of Biafra has accused elder statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, of being part of the reasons Igbo land has remained underdeveloped. Iwuanyanwu had in a statement accused IPOB of “endangering Ndigbo and their investment in Nigeria,” through their activities. In response, IPOB  in a  statement signed by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, on Monday, said, “In case he doesn’t know, the current crop of Igbo youths are wise enough to identify true Igbo elders, and Iwuanyanwu is not anywhere close on the list. “We are not surprised at such loose and careless remarks coming from a supposed elder like Iwuanyanwu who has always taken political advantage of every matter. “We advise Iwuanyanwu to stop advertising his ignorance of global economics by giving fake analysis of Igbo investments in Nigeria. We are aware, and it’s a public knowledge that the economic power of 54 African countries will come to $26 trillion by the year 2056. “With these verifiable statistics, one then wonders where ‘Elder’ Iwuanyanwu is getting his fake claims that Igbo investments in Nigeria is already worth over $12 trillion? Therefore, Emmanuel Iwuanyawu must get his records straight before coming out in public to make unverified analysis about Igbo economic power.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
