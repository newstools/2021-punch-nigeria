John Charles, Makurdi A civil society group, “Coalition of Civil Society Organizations for Transparency and Good Governance” on Wednesday, identified the failure of leadership as the bane of Nigeria’s development. Chairman of the North Central zone of the coalition, Joseph Terngu said this at a press conference at Hotel Victoria de Chateau, located along Otukpo road, Makurdi. Terngu, who used the occasion to canvas support for the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed to seek for the highest office in the land come 2023. He said, “Nigeria has continued to be plagued by myriads of problems ranging from insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, economic crimes to corruption which have retarded our progress as a people given the fact that a lot of time, energy and financial resources are being expended on tackling these unfortunate problems. “As 2023 is fast approaching, it is obvious that what we as a people need is a leader who apart from being a detribalized Nigerian, must have a track record of service, commitment and be ready to serve the people and bring an end to the myriad problems confronting our beloved fatherland today. “Having considered many of the political gladiators on the scene today, this group is of the opinion that Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed possesses what it takes to lead Nigeria come 2023 and turn around its fortunes for better if given the opportunity.” Copyright PUNCH.
