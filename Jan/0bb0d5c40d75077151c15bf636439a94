Tunde Oyekola Ilorin. Members of the State Working Committee of the Kwara State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress have expressed optimism that the party will emerge stronger after the resolution of the current crisis rocking it. The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Alhaji Aro Folaranmi, said this while speaking with journalists in Ilorin, on Tuesday. He, alongside other members of the committee, appealed to party members to participate enmasse in the forthcoming membership revalidation/registration exercise to ensure that this happens. The APC party leader, who said that the crisis was being resolved at both the national and zonal levels, added that the registration exercise was being given priority because of its importance to the party. Aro, who is a member of the faction of the party loyal to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, said, “We now have another caretaker chairman in the state in person of Abdullahi Samari. “Although, the case is still with the zonal headquarters of our party, I urge all our members to accept the verdict of the party and abide by it. “We believe that there is a crisis within the party but we had to apply Solomonic wisdom for the unity of the party in the state. “We should not allow the crisis to divert the attention of our performing governor.” Copyright PUNCH.
