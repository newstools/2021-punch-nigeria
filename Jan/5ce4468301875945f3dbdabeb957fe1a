A Dutch court on Friday ordered oil giant Shell to pay compensation in a case brought by four Nigerian farmers who alleged widespread pollution on their land. After 13 years of legal wrangling, an appeals court in The Hague ruled that Shell’s Nigerian branch must pay for damage caused by oil spills. It also held the Anglo-Dutch parent company Royal Dutch Shell liable for installing new pipeline equipment to prevent further devastating spills in the Niger Delta region.
