Chima Azubuike The National First Aid Trainer, Nigeria Red Cross Society, Bashir Umar, has advised Nigerians to learn basic first aid applications to reduce sudden deaths. Umar said this on Monday at a recertification workshop on basic first aid application for eighteen staff of the Gombe National Emergency Management Agency, saying lives would be saved when people know relevant first aid skills. He said, “When accidents happen we need to give the victims first aid treatment before they are taken to the hospital or medical people arrive at the scene. There is the need for basic knowledge.” The NEMA head of operations, Gombe, Simon Katu, said the training was in line with management’s position on the need for members of staff to use equipment to the best of their abilities. Katu noted that when members of his field office have the basic knowledge of first aid, teaching others would be easier. “This training is to equip the staff who go out to have contact with communities and in this sense will step down the training as well. By training the staff we are well equipped to handle the community. “In a nutshell, the training is a holistic approach. For the zonal office, we are 18 and each of the members of staff is being trained including the drivers and administrative staff. “Aside from this training, there are workshops, annual training for NEMA staff. Some are not field-based but community-based development training. Some of the training are, conflict management, community-based early warning systems, emergency response procedure,” he said.
