Kayode Oyero The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, says the survival of individuals in the Year 2021 is in their hands. He stated this in his ‘Prophecies for 2021’ released on Friday morning shortly after the church’s virtual crossover service held from 9pm on Thursday to about 1am on Friday. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the cleric also said some of the events of the Year 2020 will recur in the New Year 2021. The Year 2020 was marred by economic and health turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The West African nation also suffered the #EndSARS nationwide protests against police brutality and extrajudicial killings which degenerated into morbid violence and mass destruction of lives and property. Adeboye said, “God wants us in Nigeria to know that only God can lift a siege. 2 Kings 7:1-end. “The humble who put their trust in God will see the end of the siege. James 4:6. “The erstwhile ignored will become vessels unto honour in God’s hands. 1 Corinthians 1:27. “God says there will be sounds from heaven.” [READ ALSO] Kankara: Students abductions will not become a norm, says Buhari For individuals, the 78-year-old cleric said, “Your very survival and restoration will be in your own hands.
