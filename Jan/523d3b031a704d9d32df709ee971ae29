Okechukwu Nnodim The Federal Government on Friday received an Outline Business Case Certificate of Compliance and stated that it was now set to commence the procurement process for highways concession. It received the compliance certificate from the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission. Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who received the certificate on behalf of the government and the works ministry, said the roads billed for concession were under the Highway Development and Management Initiative. The PUNCH had exclusively reported on Friday that the Federal Government would receive the compliance certificate for 12 pilot federal highways billed for concession. The report stated that the concession of the roads might also signify the return of toll gates as concessionaires would have to recoup their investments. Speaking in Abuja on Friday after receiving the certificates in his office, Fashola stated that with the receipt, the Federal Government would officially commence the procurement process for the highways’ concession. He said the HDMI would facilitate further development of Nigeria’s federal highway network by bringing in investment to improve efficiency, accountability, and profitable entrepreneurship. Fashola explained that the HDMI  would be executed in two parts comprising Value Added Concession and Unbundled Assets Approval. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
