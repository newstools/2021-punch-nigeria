Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A faction of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers state loyal to the Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, has said it has uncovered a pending court injunction billed to be delivered on Monday (today) against its membership registration and revalidation. Addressing newsmen in Port Harcourt on Sunday, the state APC acting Caretaker Committee Chairman,  Issac Abbot-Ogbobula, said the purported membership revalidation and registration was not going to happen on Monday as the party never advertised such exercise. He said, “We are once more compelled to brief the press because of a plan tomorrow, Monday for an injunction against the Rivers state of the APC from participating or conducting or going on with the allegedly proposed registration and revalidation of membership exercise. “Let us put the record straight, APC in Nigeria does not have any intention of conducting revalidation and registration of membership exercise on January 12, 2021, APC Nigeria is not a secret cult, every major programme it conducts is always in the public space and domain, there is no such announcement, advertorial or publication.” Ogbobula further noted that consequent upon the development, the party had sent a petition to the Chief Judge of the State, Justice Adama Lamikanra to reassign the matter to another court as the judge currently handling it had shown obvious bias against the APC, adding that it had also sent another petition to presiding judge to recuse herself from the suit.
