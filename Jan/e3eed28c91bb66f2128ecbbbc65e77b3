Deji Lambo The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has said policemen have been detailed to fish out the suspects responsible for burning the house of a Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho in the Soka area of Ibadan State,” Oyo State. Adamu who disclosed this while innaugurating a building project at the Senior Police Officers’ quarters on Oba Aladejobi Street, in the GRA area of Ikeja, Lagos State, on Wednesday, said the criminals won’t go unpunished. “Anybody that goes to burn anybody’s property is nothing but a criminal, and we have already asked our men to fish out whoever did that and the person would be punished. That is criminal, we have laws in this country and we must respect the law and if anybody goes foul of the law, the person must be punished. “Every citizen has the responsibility to the country; those people that have information as to who did that should come out to give the police so that we can do our job,” the IG said while reacting to Igboho’s burnt house. While inaugurating the project, Adamu said the welfare of men of the Nigeria Police Force was paramount, adding that through the Federal Government initiative of public-private partnership, all the police barracks in the country would be developed. He said, “Our officers and men work tirelessly, day in day out in the country and we need a befitting accommodation to rest and return to work. What you are seeing today is one of those initiatives to develop our existing barracks instead of allowing them to decay and the officers are now getting a befitting place to stay.” Copyright PUNCH.
