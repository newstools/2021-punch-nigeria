Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Police Commissioner, Wale Olokode, on Friday said the operatives of the Department of State Services, accused of inflicting injuries on one Corporal Rauf Fawale, who died from the wounds, had not been released for investigation. It was gathered that the deceased policeman, attached to Estate Police Station, Osogbo, was at a bar in Oke Fia on January 14 to celebrate the birthday of a police officer when a fight reportedly broke out during which he was injured in the head. Speaking with our correspondent at Osun Police Command headquarters in Osogbo on Friday, Olokode said efforts would be geared towards having those fingered in the act for interrogation. He said, “Information gathered has it that he was dealt with brutally by some men from our sister agency. Right now, efforts to have those suspected are yet to yield results. “Notwithstanding, we are still making efforts to have them and hear their own side of the story. We have taken our investigation to a certain level. The remaining gap to be filled is to have the men from the other agency, so that we can complete our investigation.” Meanwhile, a rights group, World Institute for Peace, has demanded the immediate release for interrogation of the three DSS operatives from the Osun Command, who allegedly injured Fawale in Osogbo, leading to his death. The group, in a statement signed by its chairman, Mr Lamina Omotoyosi, urged the  leadership of the Osun Command of the DSS to release those operatives fingered in the act for further investigation on time to unravel the mystery surrounding the incident.
