John Charles, Makurdi Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Monday called on those planning to draw him into the 2023 presidential race to bury the thought, saying he has no such ambition. The social media has been awash of the plan by a group under the aegis of “Project Ortomise Nigeria Ortomatically 2023″ calling on Ortom to throw his hat into the 2023 presidential race. According to the group, doing so will help him to rescue the nation from the dungeons of insecurity and other socioeconomic challenges bedevilling the country Nigeria. The group in a Facebook post by one Samuel on Saturday noted that “Governor Ortom is the only detribalised Nigerian with the political will to reunite all aggrieved ethnic nationalities and rescue the country from the grips of Boko Haram, bandits, insurgents, militants and other fundamentalists making lives difficult for the citizens.
