Samson Folarin A group of Nigerians in the Diaspora, Yoruba One Voice, has appealed to the Lagos State Government to inaugurate the South-West Security Network, aka Amotekun, in the state. The group expressed concern about the spate of insecurity in Lagos, wondering why Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was delaying action on the security outfit despite their take-off in other states in the region. YOV, in a statement by the Secretary General of the group, Dr Shina Okanlomo, said Nigerians in the Diaspora were not happy with the security situation in the state. He said Lagos was becoming volatile with the activities of cultists and ritual killers. “In Lagos State, the Amotekun bill was signed into law in March last year and up till now, the security outfit is yet to begin operation in the state. “With Ogun State beginning its operation in earnest, the state has risen to the occasion with operation Amotekun. The full operation of the security outfit will ensure that lives and property are secure,” the statement added. Okanlomo said the delay in the take-off of Amotekun in Lagos was dangerous and could affect the economy of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
