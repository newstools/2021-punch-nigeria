Joseph Olaoluwa Peace Mass Transit says it decided to invest in C&I Leasing because of the growth trajectory in the maritime logistics industry. In a statement emailed to our correspondent by Communication Lead, Oluwatoyin Bayagbon, a private equity investment firm, Actis LLP, successfully exited its stake in C&I Leasing Plc to the transport firm on Wednesday. The statement titled ‘Actis exits C&I Leasing stake via a trade sale to Peace Mass Transit’ explained that the terms of the loan stock from C&I Leasing, gave Actis an option to convert the instrument to equity. However, the UK- based equity firm decided to reach a deal with Peace Mass Transit to sell the loan stock with all the rights. This, therefore, allowed PMT to convert the loan stock into equity and become the single largest shareholder in the company. A confirmatory letter from Zahi El-Khatib, a representative of Actis, confirmed that although its exit process had attracted the attention of various strategic and financial buyers, the deal was sealed with PMT on the sound advice from its financial consultants. In a statement, Chairman and Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Peace Mass Transit, Dr Sam Onyishi, was quoted to have said the decision to invest in C&I Leasing ‘is a no-brainer’, judging from the company’s remarkable growth trajectory in marine logistics and its other business lines. He added, “We have seen the value in C&I Leasing as a strong brand, hence it is a no brainer that we opted to buy out the loan stock from Actis, in a deal which we are confident will yield the expected return on investment.” Copyright PUNCH.
