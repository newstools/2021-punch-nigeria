John Charles, Makurdi THREE persons were reportedly killed on Friday at Dyom village near Senga community in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State by armed men. The bandits, said to have dressed in military camouflage, were loyalists of the late militia leader, Terwase Agwaza, also known as Gana. The Security Adviser to the governor, Col. Paul Hemba (retd.), who disclosed this to journalists on Sunday, said the suspected bandits also razed several houses in the community. He noted that the situation was brought under control with the prompt response of the troops of Operation Whirl Stroke who arrested two of the bandits. “Luckily, while this was going on, information reached the personnel of Operation Whirl Stroke who stormed the area and apprehended two of the armed men and also recovered their weapons which included live ammunition and an AK-47 riffle,” he said. However, Benue Command spokesperson, Catherine Anene, Deputy Superintendent of Police, said she had not received details of the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
