Temiloluwa O’Peters Dynamic Governance and IT Solutions Limited is set to hold a roundtable to review the nation’s economy in 2021, make projections and proffer solutions for businesses. The Group Chief Executive Officer, Dr David Ogogo, said in a statement on Friday that the webinar would expose companies on ways and strategies to remain relevant in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to him, most organisations are finding it difficult to achieve their set objectives due to the pandemic. “Consequently some organisations had to redefine their vision and mission statements so as to find ways and means of remaining relevant to ensure sustainability,” Ogogo said. The CEO said the webinar would enlighten organisations on how to remain relevant, viable and well-managed, as well as ways the country could get out of the current recession. He added that the knowledge from the webinar would enable participants to understand the causes of major corporate failures in history and how to avoid them. According to Ogogo, the webinar themed, ‘How organisations can achieve principled performance in 2021 and beyond,’ will hold virtually on Febuary 12. He said the forum would feature carefully selected economists and experts who would share their insights on ways to wither the current economic challenges. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
