Matthew Ochei, Asaba DELTA State Government has said that effective crime fighting would be achieved at the community level with the deployment of the newly recruited 378 special constabularies to their various localities of origin. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa stated this at the Community Policing Sensitisation Awareness Campaign on Wednesday in Asaba, adding that with the overwhelming increase in crime rate, the approach to community policing had become inevitable. Represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Chiedu Ebie, the governor urged the special constabularies to see their engagement as a clarion call to serve their communities. He said, “In understanding the sociology of crime in our society, it is apparent that criminal activities are initiated mostly at the local level and as such, your deployment to your various localities of origin to serve would ensure that the police become part of the neighbourhood. “I am glad that today, the issue of community policing has progressed from mere thoughts into a reality recruitment and training of over 10,000 constabularies nationwide and I must commend the IGP, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, on this feat.” Earlier, the outgoing Police Commissioner in the state, AIG Hafiz Inuwa, said with the successful passing out of 378 successful special constabularies, additional manpower had been added to support policing in the different local government areas.
