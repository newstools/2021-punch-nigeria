Peter Dada, Akure THE All Progressives Congress in Ondo State on Wednesday suspended a governorship aspirant of the party in the last governorship election in Ondo State, Mrs. Jumoke Anifowose. Anifowose, who is the daughter of the first executive governor of the old Ondo, late Chief Michael Ajasin, has been challenging the candidacy of Governor Akeredolu at the primary of the governorship poll in court. She, however, lost at the Federal High Court but vowed to appeal the lower court judgement at the appellate court. The party officers in Igboroko 1, Ward 2 of Owo Local Government Area gave the suspension order in a letter sent to the state party secretariat, Akure, after their meeting. Her suspension was with immediate effect. The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, confirmed the suspension, saying the party had received the letter from the ward. He said, “We have received the letter, and the party would look into the matter. But the party at the ward level has the right to suspend any erring member.” A party official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Anifowose was suspended for her alleged anti-party activities and not contributing anything to the development of the party.
