Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigeria Customs Service on Tuesday released mandatory guidelines that would guide and ensure the smooth implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement across the country. It also stated that the service was awaiting directives on the list of tariffs for the implementation of the continental agreement. Spokesperson for the agency, Joseph Attah, said in a statement issued in Abuja that the public should endeavour to abide by the steps required for the smooth implementation of the AfCFTA. “Sequel to the ratification of AfCFTA by member nations, the NCS has found it pertinent to inform the public about steps which must be taken to enable its smooth and full implementation,” Attah stated. The service said there was the need for each member country to have a representative in the continental chamber of commerce so as to ensure transparency in the system. It explained that having each country representative would complement the activities of the various chambers of commerce of each nation in the region. The NCS stated that while it was awaiting clear directives concerning tariffs for all goods covered by the AfCFTA, the public should have confidence in the preparedness of the service to fully deploy its services at the shortest notice. It also said the NCS was awaiting the National Action Committee on the list of duties and charges waived for liberalised goods under AfCFTA as well as the list of the 90 per cent liberalised National Trade Offers.
