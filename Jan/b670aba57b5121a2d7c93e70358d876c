Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Youths from the Kwara State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Friday urged stakeholders to support the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to succeed. The spokesman of the youth, Abdulmumin Lade-Yunusa, made the call in an interview with journalists in Ilorin. He said since the governor is the leader of the party in the state, all members should join him in his quest to make the state great again. He added that the youth are in support of the removal of the chairman of the party’s caretaker committee in the state, Bashir Bolarinwa, and the appointment of Abdullahi Samari to replace him. Lade-Yunusa said, ““We expected him (Bolarinwa) to have resigned long ago for his undisguised hatred and disrespect for the state governor and the government elected on the platform of the party he led. “It is therefore not surprising that the national headquarters of our party has done the needful. We hereby declare our support for Alhaji Abdullahi Samari while urging him to work with every stakeholder in the party. “We also warn against anyone wanting to constitute nuisance under whatever guise. Kwara is a state of harmony and no individual, no matter how highly placed, should be allowed to mess with the peace and security of lives and property in the state”. The APC youth, who commended development efforts of Governor Abdulrazaq in the state within 18 months in office, said his administration had been able to get the state off from the blacklist of the Universal Basic Education Commission.
