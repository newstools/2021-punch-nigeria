Matthew Ochei, Asaba A 42-year-old hairstylist, Adams Eguvwese, has been murdered by gunmen in the Sapele area of Delta State. The PUNCH gathered that the victim was killed in his barbing salon in broad daylight by masked men around 12noon on Sunday. It was learnt that the victim was shot in front of his saloon by gunmen suspected to be assassins. A source told our correspondent that in the past one month, no fewer than eight young men were killed in what appeared to be a cult war. “The gunmen came in a blue Toyota Corolla without a number plate. Adams (Eguvwese) was sitting outside his barbing saloon when the blue Corolla came. A man holding a shotgun approached and shot him. “He (Eguvwese) ran into the shop and the gunman went after him and shot him again at the entrance of his shop before they entered their car and drove away. “The man was immediately rushed to the Sapele Central Hospital, but was referred to the Delta State University Teaching Hospital in Oghara. Unfortunately, he died on the way to the teaching hospital,” the source said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
