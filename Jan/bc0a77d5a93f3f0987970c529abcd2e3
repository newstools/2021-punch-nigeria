Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has said he would continue to keep expanding the frontiers of his administration’s developmental efforts and sustain the delivery of dividends of good governance to the people of the state in the next four years. Akeredolu whose first term in office expires on February 23 and the second term begins on February 24, 2021, declared that his second term would not be for a holiday as he would not rest on his oars in the execution of more legacy projects. The governor stated this at the first working day prayer meeting with the civil servants, for the Year 2021, held on the premises of the Governor’s Office, Akure, the state capital on Monday. Describing the year 2021 as a significant year, when his administration will commence its second term in the actualization of its lofty programmes, Akeredolu said the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and insecurity were still around and in the midst of which all necessary sacrifices and precautions would be taken to keep the state going. He enjoined all public servants to continue to render their statutory services, diligently, stressing that the civil servants can bear witness that in the face of the obvious constraints occasioned by externalities, his administration has ensured prompt promotion and general workers’ welfare.
