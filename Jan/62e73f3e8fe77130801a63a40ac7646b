Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to order the anti-corruption agencies to probe the alleged missing N3,836,685,213.13 meant for the Federal Ministry of Health, teaching hospitals, medical centres, and the National Food Drug Administration and Control. SERAP, in a statement on Sunday by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, urged Buhari to investigate the extent and patterns of the corruption in the Federal Ministry of Health, teaching hospitals, medical centres, neuro-psychiatric hospitals, National Health Insurance Scheme, and NAFDAC indicted in the audited report released by the office of the Auditor-General of the Federation and clean up the corruption in the health sector. The statement read in part, “Investigating and prosecuting the allegations of corruption by these institutions would improve the chances of success of your government’s oft-repeated commitment to fight corruption and end the impunity of perpetrators, as well as serve the public interest. “Any failure to promptly investigate the allegations and prosecute suspected perpetrators and recover the missing public funds would breach Nigeria’s anti-corruption legislation, the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended), the UN Convention against Corruption, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to which Nigeria is a state party. “We would be grateful if your government would indicate the measures being taken to address the allegations and to implement the proposed recommendations, within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.” Copyright PUNCH.
