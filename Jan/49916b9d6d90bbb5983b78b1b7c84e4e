Segun Adewole The Inspector-General of Police, Adamu Mohammed has said that officers in the Nigeria Police Force don’t have the required logistics needed to operate. Mohammed said this on Monday during an interview on Channels Television’s Newsnight. The IGP said if the officers are given the same logistics as their foreign counterparts, they will perform better. “If you put Nigerian police officers side by side with even police officers from advanced countries, give them the same logistics, you will see Nigeria police officers performing better than those that are coming from the so-called advanced countries,” he said.
