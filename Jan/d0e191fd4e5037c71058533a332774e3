Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has said that he is still a member of the All Progressives Congress. Okorocha, according to a statement by his media office in Owerri, on Sunday, explained that the speculation that he wanted to leave the APC was untrue. The statement read in part, “Former governor of Imo State and Senator representing Imo West Senatorial District, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, has said he is still a member of the All Progressives Congress, and asked the public to disregard speculations that he has a plan to leave the party.” Okorocha was quoted to have given this clarification while addressing members of the state APC Working Committee, and leaders of the party in the zones, local government and wards, during a meeting. He was quoted as telling the party officials, that “our Party is the APC. Don’t be confused when I said that there were bad people and good people in both APC and PDP. “The good people in the two parties should come together for the good of the nation. I was talking about a movement and not a party. “I have not left the APC. I am still in the APC. Nobody has a stake in APC more than me.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
