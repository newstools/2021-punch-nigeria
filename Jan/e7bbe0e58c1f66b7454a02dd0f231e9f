Joseph Olaoluwa The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has stepped up measures to ensure the safety of travellers across the nation. In a statement obtained by our correspondent on Thursday, the authority said this was in a bid to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 at the airports. The statement titled ‘New wave of COVID-19: FAAN beefs up security protocols at airports’ outlined FAAN’s plan to secure travellers safety from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Port Harcourt International Airport, Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport and others within its network. The statement signed by the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, FAAN, Henrietta Yakubu, explained that several car parks had been rearranged for seamless pick-up and drop- off to avoid congestion. The authority added that new drop-off zones had been introduced for passengers with reduced mobility. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
