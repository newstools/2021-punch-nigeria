Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A faction of the Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress loyal to the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and another loyal to the former Senator representing Rivers South East Senatorial District, Senator Magnus Abe, have disagreed over whether or not to partake in the forthcoming APC membership registration as well as the state Local Government Council elections scheduled for April 17, 2021. While the Abe-led faction under the leadership of Golden Ben-Chioma, said it would stay away from the party registration and participate in the local government election, Amaechi’s loyalists under the leadership of Isaac Abbot-Ogbobula vowed to boycott the election and partake in APC’s membership registration beginning on February 2nd. It was gathered that the faction loyal to Abe conducted its primaries across the 23 LGAs and 319 wards of the state on Wednesday. But the Amaechi camp said its priority was to re-organise the party and mobilise its membership for future elections in the state as well as participate in the party’s membership revalidation. Ogbobula cited an order of an Abuja High Court sitting in Abuja, signed by Bello Ibrahim which asked the defendants or any person acting through them to allow the party and all the members of the Rivers State chapter of the caretaker committees to without inhibition perform their functions, including the membership revalidation. The Abe camp distanced itself from the revalidation on the grounds that a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had granted an order of interim injunction restraining the party’s National Executives, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee from conducting the exercise in Rivers pending the determination of the motion on notice.
