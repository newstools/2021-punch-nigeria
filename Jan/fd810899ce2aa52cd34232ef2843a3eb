Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress said it would wait for a former governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha, to take action on his planned political alignment before taking a stand on the issue. The party’s caretaker chairman in the state, Marcon Nlemigbo, said this in an interview with our correspondent in Owerri on Thursday. He said the party was currently focused on supporting the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); and the state governor, Hope Uzodinma, to deliver dividends of democracy to the people. Okorocha said in Rivers State on Monday when he visited Governor Nyesom Wike to inaugurate some projects said, “We have bad people in APC, just as we have them in PDP and that was why I made the call in Rivers State that the good ones should come together to lead the people”. Asked what step the party would take, Nlemigbo said, “Okorocha is a citizen of Nigeria and in our country, free speech is not a crime. We will wait until he takes action. “But let it be known that with or without Okorocha, Imo APC is strong. We are not disturbed neither are we threatened by what he said.” Copyright PUNCH.
