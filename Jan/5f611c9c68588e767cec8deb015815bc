He said this in a statement titled, “New Year: We must not give in to despair – Omo-Agege’, which was signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga. The Deputy Senate President said, “The Coronavirus pandemic disrupted our earlier plans to have the constitution alteration bills voted on sometime in December last year.
