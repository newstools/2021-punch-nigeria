Gulf leaders have signed an agreement ending their three-year diplomatic rift with Qatar at a summit in Saudi Arabia. The Al-Ula agreement, which was brokered by Kuwait and the United States ends the dispute that began in mid-2017 when a Saudi-led bloc severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and non-Gulf country Egypt had accused Qatar of supporting Islamist militant groups, an accusation that Doha denies. NAN
