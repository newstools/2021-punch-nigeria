The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has congratulated Nigerians for crossing into a New Year, urging them to face 2021 with greater optimism and faith despite the sour experiences of the last year. The caucus noted the “vigour and intensity” of its legislative activities in 2020, while pledging to intensify all statutory activities especially, legislative oversight, to ensure prompt execution of projects that have direct bearing on the welfare of the people. This is just as the Peoples Democratic Party caucus in the House criticised the regime led by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the ruling party, APC, for mismanaging the affairs of the country. The minority caucus, in a New Year message issued by the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, charged government at all tiers to give more attention to youth development, education, health care, food security programmes, economic empowerment through job creation and support for hard-working entrepreneurs. In a separate statement by the leader of the PDP caucus, Kingsley Chinda, titled, ‘We Must Remain Resilient and Patriotic,’ the opposition lawmakers said, “Our situation in Nigeria was further worsened by a poor and dwindling economy – now in the worst recession ever and – and several incidents of kidnappings, killings and general insecurity across the county, occasioned by an inept, visionless, clueless and failed leadership of the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government.”
