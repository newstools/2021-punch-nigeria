DANIELS IGONI The Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, has advised inmates at correctional centres across the country not to despair over their present situation but have faith in God for their freedom. Ewhrudjakpo stated this when he paid an unscheduled visit to the Medium Security Custodial Centre of the Nigerian Correctional Service at Okaka, Yenagoa, as part of activities to mark the Christmas and New Year celebrations. Items donated included bags of rice, beans, and cartons of noodles, groundnut oil, toiletries and cash. In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mr Doubara Atasi, the deputy governor said, “God allowed you to come here to learn a lesson. Some of you are innocent, while some are not. Whatever the case, it is not yet over. So keep hope alive.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
