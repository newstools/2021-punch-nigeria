John Charles, Makurdi The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom on Monday urged his supporters to refrain from linking him to the 2023 presidential race because he was not interested. The social media has been awash with posts of a plan by a group under the aegis of “Project Ortomise Nigeria Ortomatically 2023” calling on Samuel Ortom, to join the 2023 presidential race. The group in a Facebook post by one Samuel, on Saturday, said,  “Governor Ortom is the only detribalised Nigerian with the political will to reunite all aggrieved ethnic nationalities and rescue the country from the grips of Boko Haram, bandits, insurgents, militants and other fundamentalists making lives difficult for the citizens. “Nigeria needs a detribalised committed leader like Governor Samuel Ortom who is ready to defend the Nigerian people with all his strength and might, adding that “power belongs to God and He alone sees everyman’s heart and chooses who to entrust with such position.” While reacting to the social media post, a statement signed by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said, while Ortom values his supporters and other interest groups, “The Governor however wishes to state that his preoccupation at the moment is delivering good governance to the people of Benue State. “Governor Ortom still has two and half years to complete his mandate as Governor and is committed to greater service to the State. He particularly appreciates Benue people for the support given to his administration to succeed.” ” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
