Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigerian Correctional Service has concluded plans to train inmates in shoes, garments and leather works. This was made known by the Controller-General of Corrections, Ja’afaru Ahmed on Wednesday, while signing a Memorandum of Understanding with a private entrepreneur on the shoe and garment factory in Aba Custodial Centre and the leather factory in Janguza Custodial Centre, Kano State. A statement by CSC James Okoh of the NCoS Public Relations Unit, titled, ‘NCoS to train inmates on modern garment and shoe-making,’ said the CGC noted that the skills acquired by the inmates would enhance their employability after discharge. He stated that it would also increase the internally generated revenue of the service and enhance self-sustainability in the provision of staff uniforms and footwear as well as inmates’ uniforms and beddings. It read, “The CG used the opportunity to solicit for the support and patronage of members of the public for goods produced by inmates in order to create a sense of self-worth in the offenders.” Copyright PUNCH.
