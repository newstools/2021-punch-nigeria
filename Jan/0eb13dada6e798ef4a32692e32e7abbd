Peter Dada, Akure A former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in the last governorship election in Ondo State, Mrs. Jumoke Anifowose, has alleged that she has been receiving death threat from some chieftains of the party in Ondo State following her insistence to continue her court case against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. The APC officers in Igboroko 1 ward two of Owo Local Government had placed suspension on Anifowose, who is the daughter of the first Executive Governor of the old Ondo State,   Late Chief Michael Ajasin, for involving in anti-party activities. Anifowose, who spoke with our correspondent on the telephone, on Thursday,  said her life was under threat,  saying some APC chieftain in the state had been after her to assassinate her in order for her case to die a natural death. She said, “They are after my life,  I have been warned to stay away from the state for now,  they are planning to assassinate me,  they know if I die the case would die. They have come to beg me,  it was when I refused that they began the plan to get rid of me. But their plans have been exposed to me, I know all of them. There is nothing that can stop me from pursuing the case to a logical conclusion.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
