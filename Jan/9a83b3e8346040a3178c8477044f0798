At about 3pm on Wednesday, 13th of January 2021, there was a fire incident at Nigeria Distilleries Limited warehouse in Sango Ota, Ogun State. Whilst all routine investigations on the cause of the fire are ongoing, we can confirm that all our employees were safely evacuated with no injury or casualty recorded; Fire Marshals of the Ogun State Fire Service Command were immediately alerted, and the fire was successfully contained. As part of our safety protocols, we conduct fire safety and hazard checks periodically with Fire Marshals of the Ogun State Fire Service. All our factories are typically fully equipped with fire extinguishers, to serve as a first response, with well-trained fire response teams on site and this protocol contributed immensely to controlling the spread to neighboring factories. We would therefore like to show special appreciation to our staff for their commitment to our business and for ensuring that all safety protocols were followed. The safety and wellbeing of our people are paramount, and we are ensuring that the affected area is thoroughly assessed and rebuilt to safety before we allow for use at the earliest possible. In the same vein, the Nigeria Distilleries Limited, extends its profound gratitude to the Ogun State Fire Service for their swift response to contain this incident. We would also like to thank the Management and Staff of the following Associations and Companies for their role in containing the spread as well: Veepee Group, Nigerian Red Cross, Nigeria Civil Defense Corps, The Nigerian Police, Manufacturer Association of Nigeria (MAN), AVON Limited, Shonghai Group, MINL Limited, Nigerian Breweries PLC, Dufil Group, Fine Chemicals Nigeria, PureChem Manufacturing Limited, Somotex Group We assure our esteemed customers, consumers and vendors, that we – through our insurance company – are moving quickly and safely to get back to business as usual.
