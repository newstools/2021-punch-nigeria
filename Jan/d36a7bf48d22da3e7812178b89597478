Sodiq Oyeleke The Peoples Democratic Party has said that says the 2020 corruption index report on Nigeria by Transparency International has further confirmed that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), “is a citadel of corruption and the most corrupt in the history of our nation”. The PDP asserted that the TI report, which shows Nigeria plunging to 149th on the corruption perception index in 2020; dropping 13 places since 2015, under Buhari’s regime “is an incontrovertible confirmation that our nation is more corrupt under President Buhari and the APC, than it was in 2015 when they took office”.

Part of the statement read, “This descent into the abyss of corruption only goes to show that President Buhari’s anti-corruption stance is a mere swindle used to delude Nigerians while the vaults were laid open for APC leaders and officials of the Buhari administration to plunder. “Indeed, the record of unbroken decline from 136th in 2016 to 144th in 2018, 146th in 2019 and now 149th in 2020, under President Buhari, the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion’, settles the now notorious fact that the Buhari administration and the APC are titleholders in corruption.
