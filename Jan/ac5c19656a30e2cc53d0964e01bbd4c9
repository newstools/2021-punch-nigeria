Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Over 400 Nigerian returnees from Saudi Arabia who arrived the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja on Friday protested against observing the 14 days quarantine directed by the Federal Government. It was learnt that the returnees resisted officials of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and other sister agencies at the NAIA who tried to persuade them to observe the COVID-19 procol. Although all the returnees wore facemasks, they resisted being quarantined, arguing that they had negative test results for COVID-19. “Some of them are insisting that they have negative COVID-19 test results, but that is not what we are saying. The rule and standard protocol is that they should be quarantined for 14 days,” a FAAN official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the matter, said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had disclosed on Wednesday that 802 Nigerians would return from Saudi Arabia on Thursday and Friday. It said the citizens who were held at various detention centres over immigration issues would be received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, by its officials. It also said the returnees would be quarantined at the Federal Capital Territory Hajj Camp for 14 days in line with the COVID-19 protocols. Reacting to the development at the airport on Friday, FAAN spokesperson at the NAIA, Voke Ivbaze, insisted that it was the standard procedure for  travellers from foreign nations to be quarantined for 14 days and wondered why the returnees would oppose the move.
