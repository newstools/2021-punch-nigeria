Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan A religious sect leader, Guru Maharaji has advised that rotational presidency should be maintained to strengthen the bond of unity among Nigerians. He said this in a statement issued to mark his 73rd birthday, Sunday. Maharaji said, “Much as I am not an advocate of ethnic presidency be it Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa etc., but until we are able to install a system where the people would be in a better position to decide, there is this subsisting political culture whereby if, for instance, the North rules the nation for eight years, the baton passes on to the South, and this must as a matter of necessity remain in force. “Despite the associated imperfection with this unwritten agreement, we have to sustain it for now in the interest of decency and equity in order to give a sense of belonging to all Nigerians.” To improve policing within the country, he suggested that, “Police officers and men are to mandatorily put-on name –tags with their recruitment numbers above the breast pockets of their uniforms. Any policeman found on any duty post without his uniform should be arrested and charged to court.” He condemned the call for the use of mercenaries against Boko Haram insurgents in the North-East. Maharaiji described those calling for the use of mercenaries as “not only being unpatriotic” but ‘terrorist in political garbs.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
