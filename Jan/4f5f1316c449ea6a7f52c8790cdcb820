Rasheed from Kwara needed Granada to win or draw in his final betPawa Pick17 match. They were losing 3-1 to Huesca with 3 minutes left. But it finished 3-3 and those late goals won him the ₦20 Million Jackpot, plus ₦919,262.96 extra for wins on other tickets. Mr Eazi even called to congratulate him. This is his story… betPawa was introduced to me by my friend and I started playing late last year. What I like about Pick17 is the huge amount involved: a ₦20 Million Jackpot. I didn’t really do any research, but I am familiar with some of the teams, so I just followed my mind. I was actually monitoring the selections game by game. Check out the Jackpot I won here Wow, I was so excited, I couldn’t believe that I am the youngest millionaire in this area. The feeling was so great. I am still looking at myself, if this is true, even after I have gotten my money, it was unbelievable. betPawa has really changed my story. I really want to invest the money into my side business so that I can employ more people into my food distribution business. My advice to those that want to win with betPawa is that they should keep on trying and be positive. Nothing is impossible in this life. Even me, I didn’t believe it until it happened. Use Your Pawa to win a BIG Jackpot like me – all tickets cost just ₦10
