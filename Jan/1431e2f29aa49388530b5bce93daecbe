Chukwudi Akasike THE Pan Niger Delta Forum has said that the Federal Government has lost grip of security of lives and property following the continued killings and kidnapping across the country by bandits. PANDEF expressed surprise that government was not moved when it learnt that law abiding citizens were currently paying hoodlums huge sums of money in order to stay alive or have access to their farmlands. Spokesman of the forum, Mr. Ken Robinson, told The PUNCH in a telephone interview that apart from providing electricity through generators, drilling boreholes to get water, Nigerians were gradually taking the responsibility of securing themselves from armed robbers, kidnappers, ritual killers and fraudsters. He said, “Communities now contribute to do roads and individuals drill boreholes for themselves. Citizens spend billions of naira to buy generators to provide electricity for themselves. “Now, Nigeria has been reduced to a situation where citizens are now paying for their safety and security. Surprisingly, Nigerians are not paying to conventional security agencies; they are paying money to bandits, to criminals in order to be safe. “What can be worse than that? How low does government want the country to go before they do something drastic? Unfortunately, the fact is that security is no longer in the hands of government and the indications are everywhere. The government has lost it as far as security is concerned.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
