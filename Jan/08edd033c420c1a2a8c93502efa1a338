Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, has predicted that the economic hardship brought by COVID-19 will have 10-year consequence on the country. Yahaya, who is a former finance commissioner in the state, bemoaned the impediment presented by the pandemic. He disclosed this on Wednesday while addressing a delegation of Academic Staff Union of Universities led by Prof. Ade Adejumo, who was at the Government House to brief the governor on an impending industrial action by the Gombe State University branch. “Believe me that Nigeria will pass 10 more years in this trouble; because we don’t have the capacity to absorb the economic shock that set in with the pandemic,” the governor said. Adejumo said they were in the state to observe the branch congress, urging government to ensure adequate funding of universities. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
