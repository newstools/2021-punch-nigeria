Hindi Livinus, Yola About 30 political parties on Wednesday, withdrew their support for the administration of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, and endorsed the gubernatorial aspirations of Dr Umar Ardo, the leader of the Reformed People’s Democratic Party, a splinter political group under the PDP in the state. The political parties include the 11 which entered into an alliance with Fintiri in the build-up to the 2019 governorship elections. Ja’afar Baba-Girei, State Party Chairman, Advanced Peoples Democratic Party, who led chairmen of the 30 political parties, said they took the decision after a careful assessment of the political situation in the state. Girei said, “Before the elections, we supported him ( Fintiri) and endorsed him, but we are in a social crisis. But Ardo will now get the support of the 30 political parties because they see in him a man, who if elected as governor, would strengthen democracy; as a staunch advocate for internal democracy, which he has continued to harp on. Reacting to the development, Ardo, who confirmed his desire to vie for the governorship in 2023, said, “By God’s will, I will run. I have started a fight, and I need to complete it.” Copyright PUNCH.
