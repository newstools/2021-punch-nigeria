Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Tuesday signed the N137.6bn 2021 budget into law with the assurances that the administration will build on the ongoing infrastructural development and increased investments and youth empowerment. He also assented to the bill repealing pension payments to ex-governors. This was contained in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye. He said the governor had in November last year sought to repeal the law in fulfilment of his campaign promise and in response to public opposition to the continued payment of huge sums to former state executives. While signing the N137.6bn appropriation bill into law, AbdulRazaq said, “This budget will build on the achievements of the previous years in the areas of education, health, and roads infrastructure.” We are also focusing on youth empowerment, job creation, and social investments which are very critical at this point of our national life.” Copyright PUNCH.
