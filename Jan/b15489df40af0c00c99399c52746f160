Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja A former United States ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, says the fresh arrest and prosecution of Sahara Reporters Publisher, Omoyele Sowore, may give the incoming Joe Biden administration a bad impression of the regime of Nigerian President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Campbell said this in an article on Tuesday. Sowore, who is a human rights activist and former presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, was arrested New Year’s Eve following a peaceful protest in the capital, Abuja. He was denied bail and arraigned at a Magistrate’s Court in Abuja and is now being detained in Kuje Correctional Centre along with other activists. Campbell noted that Sowore was initially detained along with a small group of protesters at the Abattoir Police Station, formerly a facility of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, the police unit whose brutality ignited the October anti-SARS protests. He wondered why the police arrested Sowore in the aftermath of a small, peaceful protest. The former ambassador wrote, “Many of those who benefit from Nigeria’s political economy, not least the police, detest Sowore. Instigation for his arrest could have a variety of sources, not necessarily including the presidency. “The episode, if not quickly resolved, could further damage Nigeria’s international reputation—particularly among the Diaspora living in the United States. The incoming Biden administration has signalled that it will be deeply concerned about human rights issues. “The arrest of Sowore and the denial of bail is a poor representation of Nigeria to the incoming administration.” Copyright PUNCH.
