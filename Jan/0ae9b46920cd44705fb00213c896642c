Dele Ogunyemi, Warri The Department of Petroleum Resources has warned those who indulge in illegal sale of Liquefied Petroleum Gas and other sharp practices to desist from such henceforth. It said ‘black market’ gas distribution was a serious danger to the gas sector. Operations Controller, DPR, Warri Zonal Office, Mr Antai Asuquo, gave the warning at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of the DPR, Warri Zonal Office on Thursday at Ugboroke Community near Warri. He said henceforth, all trucks involved in the illegal trade would be impounded while the owner company would take full responsibilities of their drivers. The DPR controller said ‘black market’ was discouraging to the LPG business operators noting that the Federal Government had committed so much resources to grow and expand gas utilisation in the country.
