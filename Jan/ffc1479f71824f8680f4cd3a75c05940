Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The senator representing Osun West Senatorial District, Adelere Oriolowo, was whisked away from the venue of a constituency meeting in Ikire, Osun State, on Sunday, after some gunmen attacked him. Oriolowo posted on his Facebook page that his assailants attempted to kill him. He wrote, “Just escaped an assassination attempt on my life and that of my entourage. To God be the glory, we are safe and alive. “God is my helper, my shelter and my fortress, I fear no evil.” The senator’s senior legislative aide, Adams Adedimeji, who confirmed the development to our correspondent, said Oriolowo was the main target of the hoodlums. He said the senator had gone for a constituency meeting at Ikire town in the Irewole Local Government Area of Osun State, which is under his constituency. “The meeting was already in progress when the assailants struck. They shattered the windscreen of his vehicle, but he is okay now. He is already in his Osogbo home,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
