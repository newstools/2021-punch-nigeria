Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Funminiyi Afuye, said on Friday that he was not aware of any meeting of the speakers in the South-West geopolitical zone where they expressed their support for the rumoured 2023 presidential ambition of former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Report said the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, convened the meeting, held in Ibadan. In an interview with Saturday PUNCH, Afuye said, “I’m not aware of any meeting, neither was I invited to any such meeting. I can therefore not speak to any meeting I’m not privy or invited to.” At the meeting, Obasa was said to have introduced the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Foundation and Movement to the gathering, noting that the foundation was meant to break the shackles of poverty in the society and create a coordinated humanitarian image for Tinubu. The report noted that there were 20 current and former speakers from across the six states in the zone. Obasa noted that even though Tinubu had yet to indicate his interest to run for the presidency in 2023, there was the need to deliberate on the issue on his behalf. He appealed to the attendees to set up the template that would see to Tinubu’s emergence in 2023. The National Coordinator, BAT Movement, Ambassador Aliyu Saulawa, said power should shift to the South-West in 2023 and that Tinubu should be the next president. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
