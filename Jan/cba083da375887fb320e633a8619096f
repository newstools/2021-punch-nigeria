John Alechenu, Abuja Supporters of the All Progressives Congress under the aegis of the Coalition of APC Support Groups, on Wednesday, reiterated the call on the President, Major General  Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to replace the service chiefs. The group said the current state affairs in the country especially as it concerns the safety of lives and property was making it difficult for committed party members to truthfully defend the regime. This was contained in a post by the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Sam Oburu, on his Facebook wall The post read, “It is becoming increasingly difficult and making us look stupid promoting this our PMB government, without you Mr President doing something proactive and dynamic to raise the confidence of Nigerians. “We are counting down to 2023 we should be able to beat our chest that we have a President with a listening ear. “My advice Mr. President, you should do one of these two as soon as possible: Change the security chiefs or change and reshuffle your cabinet, or do both. “Let’s do something positive to reassure Nigerians that we mean well. “I love my President and I love my party APC but the narrative on the streets is not good.” Copyright PUNCH.
