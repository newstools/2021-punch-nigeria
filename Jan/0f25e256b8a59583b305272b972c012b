Joseph Olaoluwa Dutch carrier, KLM, has sacked a total of 6,000 staff members in seven months. A statement by the firm titled, ‘KLM to further restructure organisation’ dated January 21, announced the airline’s decision to sack 1000 workers. The airline blamed the loss of jobs on the new variant of the COVID-19 pandemic which has threatened the airline in addition to newer travel restrictions. The current restructuring will mean that the airline has reduced capacity by at least 6,000 after sacking 5,000 staff last year due to the impact of the virus. Speaking about the job loss, KLM CEO, Pieter Elbers, said, “In July 2020, we announced that 5,000 of our colleagues would have to leave KLM, after which we engaged with intensive consultation and cooperation with all social partners. “The further downsizing of our organisation does not yet encompass the latest measures announced by the Dutch government in the past 48 hours.” He added that the new measures were, however, in line with the restrictions and dynamics the airline had to contend with since the start of the pandemic.
