Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo For allegedly raping his 14-year-old daughter, one Kazeem Olapade, aged 44, was on Friday  remanded in Ilesa Custodial Centre by an Osun State Chief Magistrates’ Court, sitting in Osogbo. Olapade, a resident of Ido-Osun, reportedly committed the alleged offence between August, 2020 and January, 2021 when he forcefully had carnal knowledge of the victim. The police prosecutor, Jacob Akintunde, while addressing the court, accused the defendant of having sexual intercourse with his daughter for close to six months before he was caught. He said the offence was contrary to sections 31(1)(2), 214(1) and 360 of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol II, law of Osun State, 2002. But Olapade pleaded not guilty to the three counts, bordering on unlawful sexual intercourse and indecent assault pressed against him. Mr K. C. Abioye, who announced appearance for the defendant, urged the court to admit him to bail. The presiding magistrate, Dr Olusegun Ayilara, however,  remanded the defendant in Ilesa Cusrodial Centre and adjourned the matter till February 5 for hearing of bail application. Copyright PUNCH.
