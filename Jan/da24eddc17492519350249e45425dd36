Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin The Kwara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has berated the State House of Assembly for approving a N35 billion loan request by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq. The opposition party warned that the move would hamper the state’s capacity to meet future obligations. This was contained in a statement signed by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Tunde Ashaolu, in Ilorin, on Wednesday. It said by approving the “ridiculous and humongous” loan request, the Speaker, Danladi Yakubu and his colleagues have shown that they do not care about the future of the state. The party said the decision by the lawmakers to approve the loan request was ill-thought-out, depressing and disappointing, noting that the lawmakers were in the habit of approving whatever request the governor makes without giving a thought for the consequences. The statement read in part, “Governor Abdulrazaq should explain to Kwarans how he spent over N60 Billion federally-allocated funds Kwara has received since he assumed office in May 2019 and all the internal revenue realized by the State including the N19.6bn generated in 2020, as recently announced by the State Internal Revenue Service. The party accused the state APC-led administration of frittering away scarce resources to finance the opulent lifestyles of those in government instead of developing the state. Attempts to get a reaction from the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, were futile. Calls to his mobile phone were neither picked nor returned. A response to a text message sent to him on the subject was still being awaited as at the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
