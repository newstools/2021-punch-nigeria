Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, said on Sunday that he never dreamed of becoming a governor. He said this while speaking during worship service at the St. Peter’s Anglican Church in his Sampou community, in the Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of the state. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Daniel Alabrah, quoted Diri as also saying he never knew his community would produce a governor while he was supporting the governorship aspiration of others.. Diri said, “Sometimes I wonder that all the time I had been supporting the governorship aspiration of others, I did not know that God had destined me, even before I was born, to be governor. So when your time comes, nobody can stop it. “If the same God could do this for me, He will do it for you. Just be faithful, have free mind and He will do it again and again.” The governor urged Christians to be faithful to God in order to unlock more earthly blessings, just as he called on the people of the state to always give thanks and pay less attention to their worries. He said, “Let me commend the people of Bayelsa for taking out time across the state to thank God today. What can you offer to God other than to say ‘thank you’ to Him? He has the gold and the silver. He also has the power, as power comes only from Him. “If not for God, I will not be standing here as governor. So we must continue to thank Him with everything we have daily. “I, therefore, join the rest of the people of Bayelsa to say thank you Lord for keeping us to see this first Sunday of 2021.” Copyright PUNCH.
