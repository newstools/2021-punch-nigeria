Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress in the 2019 governorship elections in Ebonyi State, Senator Sunny Ogbuoji, has denied reports that he was plotting to return to the Peoples Democratic Party following defection of Governor Dave Umahi into the APC. Ogbuoji, who represented Ebonyi South Senatorial District in the Senate between 2011 and 2019, denied the reports on social media while playing host to the Ebonyi State APC Caretaker Chairman, Stanley Okoro-Emegha, in his Edda country home. Ogbuoji urged the APC Chairman to prevail on members and supporters of the party to desist from all acts of violence in order not to cast the party in a bad light. Earlier in his address, Okoro-Emegha, said he was at the Ogbuojiâ€™s home to pay New Year homage to him and also to appeal to him to remain within the progressive fold. The APC Chairman assured him that Umahi was willing and very ready to work with all leaders of the party in order to move the party and the state forward. He urged the former Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, to put aside his political differences with the governor and work in the interest of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
