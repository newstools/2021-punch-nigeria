Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, has petitioned the National Secretariat of the party to reverse the appointment of Senator Domingo Obende as Chairman, Niger State Registration committee alleging that Obende is not a member of the party. The Chairman, Caretaker Committee of the APC, Col. David Imuse (retd), in a statement on Sunday, explained that Obende’s suspension by his ward in Akoko Edo Local Government for anti-party activities since June 2020, was still subsisting. Imuse said, “We are not aware that Mr Obende’s suspension has been lifted, and that is obviously because he refused to purge himself of his gross involvement in anti-party activities especially his continuous encouragement of factionalization of the APC in ward 2 of Akoko Local Government Area of Edo State. “Rather, Senator Obende got all his supporters in his Akoko-Edo LGA to defect to PDP in 2020. “Even the money for the governorship election brought by the Peoples Democratic Party, for the election in his local government area was disbursed in his residence at Igarra. In his response, Obende, who faulted Imuse’s claims, said, “In November 2020, I was the one who  paid one year rent for the APC secretariat in Akoko-Edo, my local government. “First and foremost, nobody saw me in any meeting or rally organised by the PDP. The keys to my house in Igarra are with me and whenever I go home, I enter my house. I didn’t see anybody come to share money in my house. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
