Peter Dada, Akure The Olowo of Owoland, Ondo State, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye on Tuesday commended Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, for ordering herdsmen to vacate all the forest reserves in the state. The governor who decried the spate of insecurity in the state, also banned under-aged grazing, night grazing, and movement of cattle in cities and highways by the herdsmen in a bid to tackle the challenge in the state. In a statement issued by Chief Press Secretary to the Owo monarch, Mr Sam Adewale, the traditional ruler said the governor’s action would go a long way in solving the security challenges facing the state. He said Governor Akeredolu had done well in this regard, saying the order was long overdue, going by the high rate of crime particularly, kidnappings in the state. The monarch said, “As the Chief Security Officer of the State, the governor could not sit, watch and fold his arms while the citizens are being kidnapped at will by bandits. “The security of lives and properties of the people of the state are important to the government, therefore, all efforts of the government in this regard must be supported by all.” Oba Ogunoye also called on all the traditional rulers in the state to rally support for the governor in his bid “to rid the state of criminals and make Ondo State safe for the people to live in”.
