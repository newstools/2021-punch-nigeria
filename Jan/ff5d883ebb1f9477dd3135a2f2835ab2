Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A nursing mother, Suni Awari, has been arrested by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Monitoring Unit in place of her brother, Napoleon Dede, who allegedly took part in armed robbery in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, before fleeing. The nursing mother’s husband, Inimaza Awari, told journalists in Port Harcourt on Monday that his wife and another of brother-in-law, Oga, were arrested in Akinima, Ahoada West Local Government Area of the state. Inimaza said Napoleon allegedly committed the crime in Port Harcourt, but his wife, who knew nothing about the incident, was arrested. He stated, “We were just sitting in front of our house when some policemen stormed the house and scared everyone and asked for Napoleon Dede, and we said we hadn’t seen him for about two weeks and besides, he was not living with us. “The police arrested my wife, who is a nursing mother, and her younger brother. I have begged the police to release my wife to me but they have refused. “I have called Frank Mbah, the Force PRO to prevail on his people to release my wife, but the police have refused; now, I’m calling on the government and Nigerians to help me to beg them to release my wife, because she is a nursing mother.” When contacted, the spokesman for the state police command, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, said he had yet to be informed of the arrest, but promised to furnish our correspondent with the details once he was briefed about it. “I am not aware of the arrest yet, but when I do, I will get back to you,” he stated.
