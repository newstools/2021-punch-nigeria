Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Netherlands government has approved â‚¬400,000 for the Federal Government to embark on the National Livestock Transformation Programme in Nasarawa State. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Sabo Nanono, disclosed this at the Government House, Lafia, while on a two-day working visit to Nasarawa State. Nanono said the country had been toying with the issue of livestock development. According to him, this resulted in the misconception of the NLTP. He said the funding for the project had been approved by the Netherlands government, adding that the Federal Government would embark on a pilot project in Nasarawa State. The minister said with Nigeria having many varieties of livestock ranging from cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep, goats, camels, horses, among others, the country cannot afford to play with these national assets. The minister said he was in the state to supervise five rural roads built by his ministry across the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
