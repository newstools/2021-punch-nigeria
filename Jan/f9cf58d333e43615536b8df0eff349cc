Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan Seven persons were on Tuesday injured as a tipper and a Sport Utility Vehicle fell off the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and landed on the railway track which passes under the road. Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that the accident happened at Rainbow bus stop inside Ibadan towards the Ojoo end of the expressway. The two vehicles were said to be heading towards the same direction, lost control and fell off the bridge. One of the eyewitnesses, Abiodun Jegede, told our correspondent it was possible for the vehicles to fall off bridge because there were no railings on the bridge. Jegede said, “I was in a taxi going to Ojoo from Iwo Road and close to Ojoo two vehicles fell off the bridge and landed on the rail line that passes under. “Our driver parked and we all went to the bridge and saw the vehicles there.  Occupants of the vehicles were injured but none of them died at the spot.  Officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps arrived quickly and they were making arrangements to remove the victims when I left.” The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps in Oyo State, Uche Chukwura , confirmed the accident to our correspondent on the telephone. She said, “There was crash there. The vehicles fell over the bridge. The number of injured victims is seven. Nobody died.”  Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
