Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki FORMER aides to Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Thursday, called on the governor to channel his energies and attention to the All Progressives Congress, where he currently belonged. The ex-aides maintained that it was undemocratic of Umahi to be in the All Progressives Congress and meddle in the affairs of the Peoples Democratic Party, where he defected from. Umahi’s former aides, operating under the auspices of G-64, whose membership comprised of Coordinators of the 64 Development Centres in the state, made these remarks during a press briefing in Abakaliki. Explaining that the governor reneged on his promise, the ex-aide added that it was unfair of Umahi to describe the Peoples Democratic Party as anti-Igbo. In a communiqué released after the briefing and signed by the Chairman, Mr Ukpai Okochukwu (Ndufu Ikwo DC); Vice Chairman (South), Frederick, (Amasiri DC); and Publicity Secretary, Agu Chigozie, (Ishielu East DC), the group observed that Umahi’s family members were the highest beneficiaries of PDP’s 16-year administration in the country. “That Umahi is not a man to be trusted as he speaks from both sides of his mouth, and is known to make promises, but reneges when it is time to fulfil the same,” they said. However, the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Uchenna Orji, did not answer several calls put across to his mobile and did not respond to a text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.
