The Justice Yunusa Musa-led three-member tribunal, on Tuesday heard the petitions of APP; the governorship candidate of New Nigeria Peoples Party, Tracy Agol; and Allied Peoples Movement, while today (Wednesday) would be for the commencement of hearing in the petition by the Action Democratic Party and its governorship candidate, Iboi Emmanuel. Agol and a witness in her petition, Tawakalitu Umoru, testified on Tuesday at the tribunal and they were cross-examined by the lead counsel to the respondents. The lead counsel to APP, Segun Fiki, at Tuesday’s hearing, hailed the judges of the tribunal for signing on Monday the subpoena that he applied for on December 10 last year, which would be served on INEC’s chairman in Abuja, to compel his appearance in Benin. The lead counsel for Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, Ken Mozia, SAN, and the lead counsel for INEC, O. Osazee, did not oppose the application for adjournment, but counsel for the Peoples Democratic Party, Emeka Etiaba, SAN, raised objection to the application. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
