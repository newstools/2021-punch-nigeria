’Femi Asu Enyo Retail and Supply, a fuel retailing company in Nigeria, says it has commenced its Liquefied Petroleum Gas expansion agenda aimed at boosting the usage of gas in the country, with a target of investing in 20 plants. “The expansion agenda is in line with the Federal Government’s initiative to deepen the consumption of gas in Nigeria,” the company said in a statement. It said the expansion would necessitate key initiatives such as investment in an LPG filling plant, the launch of its first autogas filling station, a superior liquefied gas mobile app and sales of a broad range of gas-based products and services to its customers. The Chief Executive Officer, Enyo Retail and Supply, Mr Abayomi Awobokun, said, “Following the Federal Government’s declaration of 2020 as the year of gas, Enyo is thrilled to be championing the transition towards cleaner energy and making efforts to intensify domestic gas penetration as well as adoption in Nigeria. “We have set a target to invest in up to 20 LPG plants over the next 24 to 36 months and we expect to have our first autogas station open in five to six months.” The Sales and Marketing Lead, Enyo Retail and Supply, Habiba Abubakar, said the investment in LPG would enable the company to utilise emerging opportunities in the oil and gas industry while also leveraging data and technology for improved service delivery. “We have already identified sites for our Autogas points, and an approach has been mapped out to ensure that these points become operational soon,” he added. According to the statement, the company recently unveiled its technologically enhanced composite LPG cylinders, which align with its expansion plan. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
