Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Vice-President, Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria and Founder SolarCentric Technologies, Adetunji Iromini, has denied issuing a statement on the paternity scandal involving the Managing Director of First City Monument Bank, Adam Nuru, and a former bank employee, Moyo Thomas. A statement purportedly signed by Iromini on behalf of Moyo’s family which went viral on social media and was published by some media houses, stated that the late Tunde was the real father of the two children at the centre of the controversy. However, Iromini said in a statement on Tuesday that he was not the one who put out the release.
He also denied being a member of Moyo’s family, adding that he only knew her, Tunde and the FCMB boss as former colleagues.

I hereby categorically state that I am not a member of Moyo and Tunde’s family I did not issue such a statement.” The ex-banker said he had no idea why unscrupulous elements would use his name to spread fake news. He subsequently threatened to take legal action against any media outfit that publishes the fake statement. “In the meantime, I have asked my lawyers to take action against media organisations that have published the tissue of lies. Members of the public are therefore advised to ignore the purported statement as it is nothing but fake news,” he said.
