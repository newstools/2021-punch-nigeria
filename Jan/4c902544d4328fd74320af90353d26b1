John Alechenu, Abuja The opposition Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday urged the International Criminal Court to probe the immediate past service chiefs for crimes against humanity. The PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, equally urged the INTERPOL and other world bodies to commence processes that will lead to the prosecution, as well as sanctions, including travel ban and freezing of assets belonging to all those involved in killings and human right abuses by security operatives under the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). It said, “With the exit of the accused service chiefs from office, the PDP charges ICC’s Chief Prosecutor, Ms. Fatou Bensouda, to  issue official warrant in line with the court’s earlier declaration that it has enough evidence to open a full probe on alleged crimes against humanity under the outgoing commanders.” Copyright PUNCH.
