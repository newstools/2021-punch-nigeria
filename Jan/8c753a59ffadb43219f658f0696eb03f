Temiloluwa O’Peters The National Taskforce on the Prohibition of Illegal Importation of Arms, Ammunition, Light Weapons, Chemical Weapons and Pipeline Vandalism has disbanded the Director General Special Squad throughout the country. The National Executive Council of the Association charged members and security agencies to arrest and prosecute any person claiming to operate under such illegal body or group. The NEC did so during the election of its new Director-General, Dr Baba Muhammed, and Deputy Director General, late DG, Chief Okereke’s wife, Lora Okereke, on Saturday, according to a statement made available to our correspondent on Tuesday by spokesman of the organisation, Mr Paul Efiong. The council conducted the election following the demise of the pioneer DG in order to avoid vacuum, Efiong said. According to the statement, the council unanimously agreed to appoint the widow of late DG as the Deputy Director-General while the eldest son, Obinna Okereke, would be given a position at the national level. The NEC also agreed to use all legal means available at its disposal to retrieve documents, assets, as well as liabilities of Natforce from any splinter group. In an interview with newsmen shortly after the election, the new DG, Muhammed, promised to work assiduously with all relevant security agencies in the country to move Natforce forward, the statement added. He pleaded with the members of the National Assembly and the executive arm of government to expedite action on Natforce Bill which had scaled through second reading on the floor of the senate.
