Chima Azubuike Executive Chairman, Gombe State Internal Revenue Service, Mohammed Tata, on Friday, said  the state’s internally generated revenue improved from  N6.8bn in 2019 to N8.5bn in 2020. Tata, who doubles as chairman of Fiscal Responsibility of the state,  said a new revenue law in the state would take effect from May this year. Tata disclosed these while briefing newsmen on the activities of his agency in Gombe, at the Fiscal Responsibility office. He noted that the state would embark on aggressive revenue generation when the law takes effect. He however noted that due to the bloated workforce of the local council areas in the state, it was practically impossible for the payment of minimum wage to local councils. Tata said, “Gombe Local Government alone has 999 workers majority of whom are liabilities, doing nothing. “The biometric is currently going on, with a view to determining genuine workers from ghost workers.” He added that the activities of MDAs were also reviewed by his agency  to see whether resources  allocated to them were judiciously used.
