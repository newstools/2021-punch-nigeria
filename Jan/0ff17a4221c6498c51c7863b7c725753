John Alechenu, Abuja The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, on Tuesday said by the time the All Progressives Congress was done with its membership registration and repositioning, other democracies around the world would come to Nigeria to understudy the party’s democracy. The governor spoke at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, after his inauguration as the Chairman of the APC Women and Youth Sensitisation and Mobilisation Committee for the party’s membership and revalidation exercise scheduled to commence on January 25th, 2021. Bello said, “I want to assure you that we shall move to the field immediately. We are going to swing into action. We are going to liaise with every stakeholder within the party and across party lines. We are going to generate serious awareness. “The APC will continue to win every election in this country. By the time we are done and all the registration of new members and revalidation of existing members are done in the country, APC will not just be the largest in Africa but we’re going to call on even the developed nations to come and learn from APC in Nigeria. “We shall even teach some of our brothers who have just concluded elections that were rancorous. I will not mention names but we’re going to be an institution of political and politics in Nigeria.” The governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, will serve as vice-chairman while the party’s Director of Organisation, Prof. Ussiju Medaner, will serve as Secretary. Earlier, while inaugurating the committee, the National Chairman of the APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni, expressed confidence in the ability of the committee to deliver on its assignment.
