BOLA BAMIGBOLA THE Chairman, Senate Committee on Trade and Investment, Francis Fadahunsi, has called on the Federal Government to invest more on youth and women empowerment as part of efforts to de-escalate tension in the country. Fadahunsi made the call at the graduation of 250 women drawn from the Osun East Senatorial District after three days of vocational training in Ilesa, Osun state. In a statement on Saturday by his media adviser, Sam Progress, the lawmaker, who was represented at the event by a former Osun State Commissioner for Works, Dr Bayo Faforiji, explained that with the training the participants had received and the provision of startup grants for them to establish their businesses, the beneficiaries would no longer be available for vices or crime. He said the kind of communication gap between the political class and the masses that led to the last violent protest witnessed in the country should be addressed. Fadahunsi also advised the participants, who received training in soap making, bag making, tailoring, sanitiser production, hairdressing, amongst others to leverage the skills they had acquired to earn a decent living. He said, “Our main targets are youths and women. Our objective is to train them in skill acquisition and give them grants to start their own businesses and employ people. This is one of the ways to check the rising insecurity across the country. It will also bring down tension. The government at all levels has to do more in this regard to further bring down tension.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
