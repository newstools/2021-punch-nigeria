Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has praised the republican nature of the Ndigbo which he said was on display in the election of a renowned diplomat, Prof. George Obiozor, to lead the prestigious apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo. The governor noted that with the election of Obiozor, Ndigbo are sending a strong messagethat they remain willing to find common grounds with any group ready to reciprocate their gesture. He said the only thing left for the erudite Professor Obiozor, a former Nigerian ambassador to Cyprus, Israel and the United States to do is to chart a progressive path for Ohanaeze which would accommodate Nigeria’s diversity and democracy so that people of goodwill would cooperate with him. Bello said, “Kogi State has benefited from her relationship with the peace-loving and mercantile Igbo nation and has built a symbiosis with them over the centuries which we will like to expand in the days and years ahead in partnership with Prof. Obiozor and his team.” The governor advised the new Ohanaeze to invest his considerable experience and contacts, both within and outside Nigeria, to make sure Igboland in particular and Nigeria in general enjoy unity, peace and progress during his tenure.
