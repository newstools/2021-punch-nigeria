Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum has released N10 million to retired members of the Nigerian Armed Forces and families of fallen heroes. The governor gave the directive for the release on Monday shortly after he was decorated with the ceremonial Armed Forces Remembrance Emblem at the Council Chambers of the Government House in Maiduguri The chairman of the Nigerian Legion in Borno State, Col. William Mamza (Rtd.), decorated the governor as he led officials and heads of the military, the police, the DSS and para-military agencies to traditionally launch the annual emblem. Granting a request by the legion, Zulum directed the Ministry of Agriculture to liaise with its officials to identify specific areas the government can support the ex-servicemenâ€™s desire to reactivate a farmland allocated to them in the 1940s. The governor, responding to the request for allocation of a tractor by the Legion, promised to go far beyond their demands, especially since it was on agriculture; an area he is obviously passionate about. He, however, charged officials of the Legion to ensure commitment to agricultural activities after getting support from the government. Zulum also appealed to the officials to use the funds generated through the ceremonial emblem launch in such a way that the needy families, particularly of fallen heroes, are supported through various means.
