Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt A former member of the House of Representatives, Jerome Eke, has died few days after losing his wife identified as Joan.

When contacted, Eke’s kinsman and predecessor in the House of Representatives, Ogbonna Nwuke, confirmed the former lawmaker’s death. Nwuke, who is the Rivers State spokesman of the All Progressives Congress, describe Eke as an “astute campaigner and jolly good fellow’, saying his demise is a big loss to the Etche people. “He (Eke) was a jolly good fellow, a very astute campaigner and he was very close to me regardless of our political differences. It is a great loss for the Etche nation,” Nwuke said. Also, a councillor and leader of Etche Legislative Assembly, Blackson Nwayanwu, said, “Yes, he (Eke) is actually dead. But I don’t know the details yet. His wife too is dead.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
