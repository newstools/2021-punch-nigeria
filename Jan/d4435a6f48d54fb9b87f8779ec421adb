 Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has ordered the closure of Creek Road in Port Harcourt to vehicular and human traffic, condemning the action of traders who converted the full stretch of the road to a market. Also, the governor barred boat operators from using the Bonny Jetty due to the level of filth there, saying thorough sanitation would be carried out before it would be reopened. These were contained in a statement issued by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, in Port Harcourt on Sunday. The statement read, “The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has reaffirmed the closure of Creek Road in Port Harcourt to vehicular and human traffic beginning from midnight on Monday, January 4, to Saturday, January 9, 2021. “Governor Wike also barred boat operators from using the Bonny-Bille Jetty during the same period. “Governor Wike sternly warned that any trader or boat operator who dares to conduct any form of business along Creek Road and the jetty, would face the full wrath of the law. “The governor further ordered the removal of all vehicles parked at the jetty and its surrounding environs. He directed law enforcement agencies to ensure that the temporary closure of Creek Road and the Bonny-Bille, is enforced.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
