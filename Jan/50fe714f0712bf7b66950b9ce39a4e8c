Ada Wodu, Calabar Cross River State primary school teachers, who were demoted in 2016 by the State Universal Basic Education Board, on Wednesday, protested in Calabar over alleged non-payment of their salaries for six years. Some of the teachers, who spoke to journalists in Calabar, said they had been stagnated by SUBEB and that some of their members had died in the process. Speaking on behalf of the teachers, Mrs Ekponwan Ekanem, said, “We are stagnated because of the demotion. Over 2,000 of us were affected across the state. “We have not been paid since 2016 and many have died due to hardship. Some are receiving alerts far below their monthly salaries while some of us don’t even receive anything.

So, the issues are being sorted out. “Some were demoted down to Grade level 4 because they had no teaching qualification.”
