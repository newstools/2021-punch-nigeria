Alexander Okere The All Progressives Congress has described the defection of all the seven members of the Allied Peoples Movement in the Ogun State House of Assembly as a welcome development. It said the lawmakers showed boldness with their action. The Publicity Secretary, Ogun APC Caretaker Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, in a statement titled, ‘Defection of all seven members of APM in Ogun Assembly to APC, a welcome development,’ said, “Our caretaker chairman, Chief Yemi Sanusi, welcomes the former APM members and we see their bold  action as a welcome development and long expected, especially since the APM’s governorship candidate in the last election, Kunle Akinlade, announced his return to APC at a well reported press conference last year. During the event, he referred to his former party, APM, as dead in Ogun State.” “While urging the returnees to cooperate with the Governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Oladunjoye commended the governor on his non-sectarian disposition to all the members of the House of Assembly regardless of political tendencies or affiliations. He urged the defectors to seize the opportunity of the ongoing APC membership revalidation and registration exercise to register at their polling units  since what they did on the floor of the House was merely ceremonial and statutory because of their status.
