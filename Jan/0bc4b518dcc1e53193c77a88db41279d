Samson Folarin The President, Women Arise and Centre for Change, Joe Oke-Odumakin, has called for the unconditional release of a human rights activist and journalist, Mr Omoyele Sowore. Sowore and four others were arrested by the police for holding a protest on New Year Eve. Oke-Odumakin, in a statement on Sunday, described the arrest as unlawful and a violation of the rights of the victims. She said, “There have been allegations of torture against the Nigerian state over the maltreatment of Mr Sowore since the latest arrest. “These are clearly unconstitutional and are a clear violation of his person. “We demand the immediate release of Sowore and his colleagues from these unjust conditions, which are clearly unconstitutional. “It should by now be clear to the Nigerian state that these intimidating acts cannot stop Nigerians from demanding for the right things to be done in the country.”
