The Ogun State Government has approved the immediate reconstruction of the 2.35km Journalists Estate Road at Arepo in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the State. According to the state Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Mr Ade Akinsanya, preliminary work has already commenced and the contractor is expected to be on the ground from this weekend. Akinsanya said, “The contractor is in the process of establishing an office and construction yard around the area and when work begins on Sunday, I will be visiting the project site in company with the contractor-in-charge. This is a high priority project and work at the site will start soon. “The project is scheduled for completion in nine months. The road, which is 13-metre wide, 1m by 1m covered reinforced drainage, and stone pavement when completed, will be fully illuminated with streetlights, lay-bys, and other exotic road furniture.” The commissioner stressed that the governor prioritised the Arepo road because when completed it would provide relief for road users along the Lagos-Ibadan express axis that had faced difficult times navigating their ways to their homes, especially during the rainy season.
