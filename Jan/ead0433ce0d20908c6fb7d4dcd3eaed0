Temiloluwa O’Peters The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service has extended the filing of Employers’ Annual Returns by additional two weeks, from January 31 to February 14, 2021. According to a statement signed by LIRS Executive Chairman, Ayodele Subair, the extension is in response to appeals made by taxpayers, as well as an attempt to assuage the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on taxpayers and residents of Lagos State. Subair noted that according to law, the filing of company’s annual returns expired on January 31st of every fiscal year, and attracts stiff penalties for defaulters. He therefore urged taxpayers to take advantage of the extension to perform their civic obligation. The statement said, “We implore taxpayers with difficulties in filing of their annual returns to seek assistance with specially designated staff at our tax stations or call our customer care representatives. “Further updates on our business operations and alternative payment platforms of the service can be obtained by visiting the LIRS website, and its various social media platforms.” LIRS also appealed to Lagos residents to support the efforts of the state government by adhering strictly to the safety guidelines as issued by relevant health authorities.
