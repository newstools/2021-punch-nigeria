In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, Sanwo-Olu further directed that a fresh process that would terminate in 45 days should commence immediately.

The outgoing Vice- Chancellor, Prof Olanrewaju Fagbohun has also been directed by Sanwo-Olu to convene an emergency Senate meeting. The meeting is for the purpose of appointing one of the deputy vice-chancellors, who is not a candidate in the cancelled selection process as an acting vice-chancellor from Monday, Jan. 11, 2021, when the tenure of Fagbohun expires. The governor further directed that, the Senate should select among its members, a pro tem chairman to superintend the meeting and conduct of election of an acting vice-chancellor.
