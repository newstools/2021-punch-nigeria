Sodiq Oyeleke Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has cautioned against any attempt to arrest Sunday Adeyemo, a youth activist popularly known as Sunday Igboho. He told Oyo governor Seyi Makinde and Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, that arresting Igboho would escalate tension in the South-West region. The PUNCH had reported that Senior Special Assistant to President Muhumadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, during an interview with BBC Hausa, said IGP Adamu, had ordered the arrest of Igboho for giving Fulani in Oyo State an ultimatum to exit the state.

Makinde had also directed Onadeko to arrest “persons found guilty of stoking ethnic tension”. However, Fayose wondered why Igboho would be arrested, saying northern governors had a dialogue with terrorists.
