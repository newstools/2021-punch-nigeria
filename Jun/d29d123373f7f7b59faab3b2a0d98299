Oil marketers under the aegis of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria on Sunday threatened to embark on an industrial action over alleged extortion by officials of the Department of Petroleum Resources. This could lead to fuel scarcity. Marketers under the Suleja/Abuja Unit of IPMAN told journalists in Abuja that they would have to down tools on Monday (today) should officials of DPR fail to refrain from the alleged extortion of oil dealers. Chairman of the unit, Yahaya Alhassan, also stated that the request by DPR for daily transaction records from filling stations was another bone of contention. He said, “IPMAN has no other alternative than to instruct our members not to load from Suleja depot in Niger State as a way of expressing our frustrations after all efforts to make DPR officials desist from unethical practices failed. “IPMAN Suleja/Abuja Unit needs explanation from DPR concerning the demand for daily sale activities from filling stations. These issues have to be resolved before we can commence lifting of products from the depot.” When contacted on the matter, the Vice President, IPMAN, Abubakar Maigandi, told our correspondent that the national body of the association was aware of the development. He, however, stated that IPMAN at the national level had commenced moves to halt the strike, as it had invited the affected unit and was also consulting the DPR in order to forestall the strike. “We are aware of the threat to embark on strike by our Abuja/Suleja Unit but we are intervening in the matter to stop the strike,” Maigandi said.
