A 61-year-old woman, Mrs Queendaline Udoh, has been remanded in the Enugu Custodial Centre for allegedly aiding the sexual assault of her seven-year-old granddaughter at the cost of N1,500. The woman, who hails from Imezi-Owa community in the Ezeagu Local Government Area of Enugu State, was arrested and arraigned alongside 25-year-old Miracle Akpan, who allegedly repeatedly had carnal knowledge of the minor. The PUNCH gathered that the incident happened on June 13, 2021, at Ugwuagor Abakpa-Nike in the Enugu East council area, where the suspects and the victim were residing. A viral video posted on the Internet revealed the moment members of the community paraded the suspects in public. In the video, Akpan confessed to paying Udoh N1,500 on every visit. The Enugu State Police Command said the suspects had been arraigned and remanded in prison. A statement issued by a spokesman for the command, Daniel Ndukwe, disclosed that the woman had been exploiting the minor for financial gains. Ndukwe said the suspects were charged to court on Tuesday and remanded in prison pending further hearing of the case.
