THE Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board has extended the registration for the 2021/2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculations Examination to June 15 for candidates who have not completed their registration. The affected candidates were asked to visit special centres to finish the process. JAMB’s spokesman, Fabian Benjamin, stated this on Monday in a statement titled ‘Completion of 2021 UTME/DE registration for candidates who did not register within the stipulated time and the extension period’. Benjamin explained that the extension was for only those who could not complete their registration during the earlier scheduled registration period. He pointed out that only candidates whose names were compiled after giving reasons for the incomplete registration process and had been contacted “are expected to visit the centres.” JAMB further explained, “At the end of the period originally scheduled for the 2021/2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculations Examination and Direct Entry registration on May 15, the registration period was extended. “Another two weeks that elapsed on May 29 was given to accommodate candidates who, largely due to issues related to newly introduced pre-requisite of National Identification Number, could not register.” Copyright PUNCH.
