PLATEAU State Governor, Simon Lalong, has confirmed the sack of the state Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Letep Dabang. Lalong confirmed what was until then a rumour during a lecture and dinner organised for APC stakeholders as part of the activities to mark Democracy Day, at the Government House, Jos, on Saturday. The governor paused mid-way into his speech at the event to introduce a new state party chairman. He said, “We have a new APC chairman in Plateau. He is here with us, I saw him trying to send a text message using his phone and I said, “Let me stop here and recognise him before he will suspend me.” Although did not elaborate, our correspondent gathered that the new acting chairman, Enock Fanmak, was until his appointment, the state APC Vice Chairman. The former acting chairman, Dabang was suspended via a letter dated June 11, 2021, signed by the APC Acting National Secretary, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe. It read in part, “The Party is in receipt of a correspondence suspending you from office as the State Caretaker Chairman of Plateau chapter of our party, over anti-party activities. “The information of your suspension is contained in a document endorsed by a good number of members of the State Executive Committee, of which the Executive Governor of your state, equally serves as a member, cannot be ignored.” The letter also noted that based on the allegations against the former chairman, a three-man fact finding committee was set up to investigate. Dabang was asked to proceed on suspension until the case against him was dispensed with. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
