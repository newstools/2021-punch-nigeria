A Nigerian, Mark Okuo and his Kenyan accomplice, Florence Musau, have been accused of alleged conspiracy in internet scam, leading to over $4 million. The 41-year-old Okuo and 36-year-old Musau were accused of depositing $1.3million into various bank accounts from their fraudulent proceeds since 2018, DailyMail reported. About $195,000 was obtained through five romance scams from dating apps. The duo has been working together since 2018 to defraud people via dating and banking platforms and on Monday, Musau pleaded guilty to wire and bank fraud. According to a criminal complaint, Okuo had defrauded unsuspecting women on dating sites under the pretext of being aÂ  US Army soldier from Africa or Middle East. He had always promised them marriage, as he asked the women to wire him money to enable him to leave the military and return to the US. In one case, Okuo had professed love to a woman from Georgia, claiming that he needed $4,700 to return to the US to marry her. The unsuspecting victim had transferred the amount to an account controlled by Okuo. One of his victims had also transferred $137,000 to bank accounts that were controlled by Okuo and Musau, after falling for his tactics. His Kenyan accomplice, Musau, after pleading guilty, was on Monday sentence to 30 years imprisonment beginning on October 14.
