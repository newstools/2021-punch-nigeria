The Candle Light City Foundation has unveiled strategies to enhance business restart when the pandemic finally subsides. The chief executive officer of the non-governmental organisation, Edwin Asongwe, at a briefing in Lagos, said the COVID-19 pandemic had affected many businesses, hence the need to empower youths to revamp the economy. He said, “The government and a lot of non-governmental organisations have seen the need to invest in young people. Teaching youths about entrepreneurship and skills development is vital in tackling unemployment. “Our foundation intends to organise a youth camp workshop in August where we hope to train 150 youths across the country for the first phase. Our plan for the workshop is to restructure the institutions so that, at the dying stage of COVID-19-19, life can resume normally.” Also, the International Consultant to the Foundation, Pastor Mai Abehche, said the initiative was to produce five million entrepreneurs between 2021 and 2025.
