Gunmen numbering about 15, on Thursday, attacked Ojoto Police Station in the Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State. One Inspector of Police was reportedly killed in the attack. A source told our correspondent that the police operatives on duty fought back and repelled the hoodlums, thereby preventing them from setting the station ablaze. “The hoodlums zoomed off when our men(police) fought back and warded them off. They came in three Sienna vehicles,” the source said. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, said he would not want to speak on the matter until after visiting the place. He said, “I’m planning to visit the area. I will not respond until after visiting the place.” A senior Police officer in the state who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the incident. He said, “We lost one Inspector today again. The state Police Commissioner, Chris Owolabi, is preparing to visit the area.”
