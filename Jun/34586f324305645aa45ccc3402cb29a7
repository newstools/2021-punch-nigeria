The Kano State Government on Tuesday entered into a public private partnership agreement on efficient waste management with Capegate Investment Company Limited. The state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, made the disclosure during the inauguration of Keep Kano Clean Week, at the Jakara mega drainage, which goes through Kurmi Market, Koki area and links Kwakwaci, behind the old Triumph Newspapers company. In a press statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwar, the governor said, ‘’We are engaging the services of a private company on a public private partnership agreement. We are now fully into the waste-to-wealth period. Our waste will now be an avenue for wealth creation, including other related benefits, like improvement of electricity supply in the state through the use of waste.” Ganduje, shortly after encouraging members of the public to always keep their environment clean, also reminded them that “even in Islam, sanitation is of significant benefit and each and every Muslim is encouraged to always ensure a healthy environment.” He urged the people around Jakara mega drainage to desist from dumping refuse in the drainage which could cause serious flooding. Earlier, the state Commissioner for Environment, Dr Kabiru Getso, commended the governor for the foresight. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
