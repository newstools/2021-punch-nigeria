Social media platform, Instagram, has taken down the account of the Chief Executive Officer, IPI Group, Adamu Garba. Garba, who is also an All Progressives Congress chieftain, made the announcement via his Facebook page on Wednesday. He wrote, “They’ve taken down my Instagram too. This could happen to anyone for voicing out contrary opinions. More reasons why we should work excellently on Crowwe.” Checks by our correspondent confirmed that his Instagram account, @adamugarbaii, has been deleted from the social media platform. This action by Instagram comes days after Garba’s social media application, Crowwe, was deleted on Google Playstore. In a chat with The PUNCH on Monday, Garba claimed that Crowwe was removed because he needed to update the code, adding that the app would be back up latest by Tuesday. However, checks by our correspondent showed that the Crowwe app is yet to be available on Google Playstore as of the time of filing this report.
