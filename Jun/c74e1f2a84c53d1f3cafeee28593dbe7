Amnesty International, in a tweet on Tuesday, urged the Federal Government to protect the lives of Nigerians, following the incessant killings, robbery, kidnapping and other acts of violence that has become part of Nigeria’s recent history. The tweet read, “Protect the lives of Nigerians: —Kebbi State: Danko-Wasagu 88 killed —Oyo state: Igangan 11 killed —Benue state: Agatu 30 killed.” Nigerians in the comment section expressed displeasure over the many crimes committed against humanity by non-state actors and the style chosen by Nigeria’s president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to combat these vices with silence. A twitter user, @_DrSilva said, “Fulani militias heavily backed by the government are eliminating people at ease. They don’t even want to have this conversation.” Similarly, another Twitter user, @Ikezubix said, “People are being abducted and killed by the Nigerian security forces in the South Eastern part. Please amplify!” “And the president never addressed the issue but he rushed to ban Twitter to show his incompetence,” @MufasaBrown said. Bandits, herdsmen and other non-state actors have killed 394 and kidnapped 224 in Nigeria in one month, according to a report by Eos Intelligence. Just two days ago, in Igangan Community, Ibarapa North Local Government Area, some suspected herdsmen had razed the community at night killing over 20 people.
