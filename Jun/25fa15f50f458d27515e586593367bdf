The former Vice Chairman of Lagos Island Local Government Area, Asekun Kehinde, has just been remanded in prison custody following his arraignment in the Lagos State Federal High Court for allegedly exporting 1,000 kilogrammes of cocaine. The defendant, who was arraigned by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency on a charge marked FHC/L/99c/2021, pleaded ‘not guilty’ to a one-count charge. Justice Ayokunle Faji subsequently remanded the defendant after listening to submissions from the counsel of both parties. The judge then adjourned his ruling till July 16, 2021, while reminding the defendant in custody.
