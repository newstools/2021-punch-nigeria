Operatives of the Kaduna State Police Command on Monday foiled an attempt by some bandits to abduct an Indian at Dankande village in the Igabi Local Government Area of the state. It was said one of the hoodlums was killed during the operation and his body recovered by a joint team of the Nigerian Army and the police, who combed the area on Tuesday. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Jalige, in a statement on Tuesday, said four AK-47 rifle magazines with live ammunition were recovered from the bandit. Jalige said, “On June 21, 2021, around 9.33pm while on escort duty of an expatriate to Plan Farm Phase at the Dankande area of Igabi LGA, police officers ran into an ambush laid by suspected armed bandits, who in their desperate attempt to kidnap the expatriate, shot indiscriminately at the officers, which however was met with stiffer resistance from the operatives. “The gun duel lasted for some time, but the operatives were able to repel the bandits and secure the Indian expatriate unhurt. Meanwhile, the bandits fled into the forest with bullet wounds. “A joint team of the police and military personnel, while searching the area today, June 22, 2021, recovered the lifeless body of one of the bandits, four AK-47 magazines fully loaded with 120 rounds of live 7.62 X 39mm ammunition and a mobile phone. “The recovered body has been deposited in a morgue, while forensic analysis of the said phone is being carried out with the view of getting more details on the gang.” Copyright PUNCH.
