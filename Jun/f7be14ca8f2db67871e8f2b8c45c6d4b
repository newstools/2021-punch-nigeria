A broadcaster and singer, Sulaimon Adegbenro, popularly known as Consoligbadun, has said that he sometimes feels underappreciated in the entertainment industry. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, the singer said, “I feel underappreciated really. I say this because I was one of the few artistes who championed the one-man-band movement. Now, my style has been adopted by many bands. However, those who meet me in person usually acknowledge my talent and versatility. I use my music to promote our cultural values. Though I have a strong inclination towards dance music, I still make sure my lyrics give positive messages of hope to the downcast. I extol the virtues of hard work, industry and positive vibes while warning against vices that do no one any good.” Baring his mind on the quality of songs churned out these days by young artistes, Consoligbadun said, “Not many musicians today can play a single musical instrument, and that is not good enough. That is why most of them cannot lead bands. They would rather take their CDs to shows and lip-synch to the songs. There is room for improvement but we must also acknowledge that some of our young musicians are doing well, especially on the world stage. “A society gets what it deserves. If music lovers patronise musicians who sing positive songs and ignore the lewd singers, they would help to reward good efforts and empower the right people. If we all say no to immoral songs, those singing it would either change their style or get out of business.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
