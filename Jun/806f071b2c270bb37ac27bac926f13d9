The Super Eagles of Nigeria lost 1-0 to the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon in the international friendly game played on Friday at the Wiener Neustadt Stadium in Vienna, Austria. A 37th minute strike from Fulham’s midfielder, Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, ended the Super Eagles’ three-game unbeaten run against the Indomitable Lions. The Super Eagles had seized control of the game at its initial stages, gaining a disproportionate ball possession over Cameroon but were unable to register a goal. Genk’s forward, Paul Onuachu, would come close to finding the net in the third minute but had his header parried away by Cameroon’s goalie, Simon Omossola. Eventually, the Cameroonians grew into the game, staunching every Eagles’ attack, even as Gernot Rohr’s men mounted pressure. Iheanacho, Ndidi, and Etebo had the chance to net the equaliser but were unlucky in that regard. The Eagles’ woes of the night piled on
when defender and captain William Troost-Ekong suffered an injury, forcing him to be replaced with Valentine Ozornwafor. The teams meet again next Tuesday in another international friendly game to be played also in Austria.
