Green Africa Airways Limited has announced the arrival of its third aircraft ahead of operations. The Lagos based airline said it had completed the acceptance of 3 ATR72-600s from ACIA Aero Leasing as required by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority for a new airline to hold an AOC and commence commercial flights. The airline which recently launched its website, announced a 10 per cent discount off tickets sales and lower flights for its customers. The Punch had earlier reported the arrival of the first and second aircrafts with the third expected soon. According to the statement issued by the airline on Thursday, the third aircraft with registration ZS-XZC/5N-GAD, arrived in Lagos on Thursday, 3rd June 2021. It said amid the pandemic-induced market disruption, Green Africa laid out a roadmap for market entry by deploying ACIA’s ATR aircraft to deliver affordable, short-haul connectivity between Nigerian cities to stimulate the region’s economic development and business activity. The Chief Executive Officer and Founder, Babawande Afolabi, said, “Receiving our third aircraft today signifies Green Africa’s readiness to enter into service and start serving our customers. ACIA Aero Leasing has been a very supportive partner and we are proud of this relationship.” Reacting to the development, Chief Executive Officer, ACIA Aero Leasing, Mick Mooney, said “We are thrilled to have partnered with Green Africa’s experienced management team to get their airline off the ground while supporting their ambitious mission to use the power of air travel to create a better future for customers and other key stakeholders.” Copyright PUNCH.
