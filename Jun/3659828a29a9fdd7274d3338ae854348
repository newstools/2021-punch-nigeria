The Joint Security Committee of Emure, Ise and Ikere communities in three council areas of Ekiti State have called for intensified and regular combing of the expansive forests from Ikere Ekiti to the borders of Ondo and Kogi states to keep kidnappers at bay. The JSC Chairman, Elder Tunji Falana, said, “The gory tales from released kidnapped victims have confirmed that the dens of some kidnappers are not too far away from the Army checkpoint between Ise and Ikere.” Falana, in a communiqué at the end of the 6th JSC meeting at the palace of the Ogaga of Ikere Ekiti, said, “JSC Intelligence Unit has also confirmed the existence of at least 35 camps belonging to Fulani herdsmen between Ikere and Emure forests.” In the communiqué made available on Monday, the JSC faulted claims that the killer herdsmen were not known to those rearing cattle. It stated, “There is no dichotomy between one sect of Fulani herders and others because they always have linkages and network among themselves. They all share the ransom collected from the kidnapped victims together. Informants, who live among us, are always well compensated.” The committee advised regular combing of the “forests from Ikere to the borders of Ondo and Kogi states by the combined forces of the Police, Amotekun Corps, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, hunters, Vigilantes and O’dua Peoples Congress. Falana, who lamented dearth of patrol vehicles in Ikere Police Division, called on the Commissioner of Police, Tunde Mobayo, to redress the trend for the security agents to be able to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently.
