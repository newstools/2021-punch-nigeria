The Managing Director of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, Peter Ikenga, has said that his company is focused on boosting energy penetration, adding that the country lacked 40 per cent energy penetration. He said this while visiting the office of the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, alongside members of the management of Transcorp on Tuesday in Abuja. This was contained in a press statement titled ‘Minister urges for technology domestication’ issued by a member of the ministry’s Press and Public Relations Unit, Otuyemi Adetayo. The statement said, “Ikenga said his company wants to leapfrog the transmission of sustainable and alternative sources of electricity around the country. “He also said that over 40 per cent of the country lacked energy penetration and his company wanted to achieve energy penetration in all parts of the country.” The minister was also quoted to have said the Organised Private Sector should domesticate critical technology used in the country, in order to achieve rapid industrialisation. It added that the minister recommended the use of nuclear power technology to enhance electricity production. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
