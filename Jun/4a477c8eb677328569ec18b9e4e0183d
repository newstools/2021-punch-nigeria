The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, is in talks with investors, development partners and other stakeholders on the construction of an airport in Edo North Senatorial District to open up the area and boost economic activities in the state. Obaseki, who disclosed this during an enlarged meeting of Peoples Democratic Party members across wards and local government areas in the district, said the government was working assiduously to improve the state’s transportation network. He said, “There are some key projects that we want to implement in Edo North. There are major investors talking to us now and want to come into the state. We have huge opportunities in the areas of agriculture, mining and transportation. “One of the major things that I want to do is to build an airport. Access is key, and if people can fly in directly, it will improve the economy of the state.” He added, “We have been working on improving the transportation network in Edo State; we have done some studies and found out that an airport in Edo North is feasible, particularly given the level of investment that we are making in that direction. “Don’t forget that there are two cement plants in the state, major universities and several other economic opportunities that are involved, and to get people there, we need an airport to make access easy. We are in discussion with the relevant authorities already.” On his part, a party chieftain and former Deputy Governor of the state, Chief Mike Oghiadomhe, commended the developmental strides of the governor, pledging the support, commitment and loyalty of party faithful from Edo North Senatorial District to his administration.
