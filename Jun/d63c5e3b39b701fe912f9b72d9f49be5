GOVERNORS elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress have said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has the final say as to when the party’s proposed national convention would hold. Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, Abubakar Bagudu, said this after a late-night meeting of the forum, in Abuja, on Wednesday. He told reporters on Thursday that the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the party, briefed his colleagues and informed them that a proposal for the time-table/ schedule of activities leading to the convention was before the president. He noted that once the president gives approval a date will be announced. Bagude said, “There is a proposal before Mr. President and once he approves it, the National Caretaker Committee will announce the date. “We considered the timetable and we have made some inputs particularly to comply with the Electoral Law and the party’s constitution. Remember, we governors are just one organ of the party.” The governors also passed a vote of confidence on Governor Buni and his team. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
