SOME soldiers and policemen took sentry at strategic locations in Ode-Itsekiri (Big Warri), the ancestral home of the Itsekiri nation on Saturday as 14 days funeral rites for the repose of the soul of the departed Olu of Warri, His Majesty, Ogiame Ikenwoli, kicked off with an all-night cultural parade held by Itsekiri sons and daughters, home and abroad. The unusual heavy presence of the military and police officers in Ode-Itsekiri was visible right from the community’s jetty enroute the main town hall, venue of the event, where all participants were thoroughly frisked by operatives before being allowed entry. The PUNCH gathered that the security measures were taken apparently to forestall a repeat of what was witnessed at the High Court in Warri last Thursday when suspected hoodlums besieged a courtroom and disrupted proceedings in a suit instituted by one of the parties challenging the ongoing succession bid to fill the vacant stool of the Olu of Warri. The Nigerian Bar Association, Warri Branch, led by its Chairman, Chief Emmanuel Uti, had called on the security agencies to “immediately set in motion measures to prevent recurrence”. However, the Saturday’s all-night traditional funeral rites was hitch-free with Ogele Ukpukpe, Ibiogbe and Uku-Umalikun Ola-Aja dancers, from the various Itsekiri communities, in their traditional costumes, showcased their rich cultural heritage to the delight of the teeming spectators, including non-indigenes. Meanwhile, the acting Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, Bright Edafe, described the noticeable heavy presence of operatives at Ode-Itsekiri as “a proactive security measure”.
