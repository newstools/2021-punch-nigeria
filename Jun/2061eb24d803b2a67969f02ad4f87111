In this episode of So This Happened, we couldn’t help to talk about the issue of insecurity that is now the reality of Nigerians. A school bus was hijacked in Ondo State. Thankfully, children were not on the bus but the attendant was in there. She was able to escape later. The bus is still in the custody of the gunmen. Moving on, we reviewed the viral story of a dead person, who allegedly refused to be buried until it pointed out the house of its suspected killer. Interesting right? In Uganda, a woman who has been married for 20 years with six children woke up one day, dumped her family, and got married to the ‘Holy Spirit.’ What’s her motivation? Watch the video till the end.
