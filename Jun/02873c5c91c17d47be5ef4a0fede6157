Nigeria’s women handball team will begin their Group B Africa Women Handball Championship campaign on Tuesday against DR Congo in Cameroon. For their second game of the campaign, the coach Rafiu Salami tutored side will face hosts Cameroon on Thursday, before playing their last group game against Kenya two days later. The Nigerians left the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja on Friday and arrived in Douala on Saturday, after a stopover in Kigali aboard Rwanda Airline. On arrival, the Nigerian delegation, led by Secretary-General, Handball Federation of Nigeria, Maigidansanma Mohammed, was received by the Consulate-General of the Nigeria High Commission in Douala, Safiu Olaniyan, and his wife, Medina. Olaniyan, who hosted the team, charged them to make Nigeria proud both on and off the court. “We want you to make Nigeria proud and we will support you. Nigerians in Cameroon have been mobilised and they are ready to give you all the necessary support to ensure you do well in the championship,” Olaniyan said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
