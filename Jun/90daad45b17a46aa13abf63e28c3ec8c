The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has condemned the murder of Pa Joshua Ayomike and his wife, Chichi, at their home in Warri, Delta State. The governor urged the police to unmask the killers and bring them to justice. The couple’s decomposing corpses were found in their Warri GRA residence on Monday, June 28, 2021. Obaseki said he received the news with a heavy heart. “With the details of the circumstances that led to their gruesome killing still sketchy, I call on the Nigeria Police Force to thoroughly investigate the extremely puzzling event and ensure that the culprits are brought to book,” he added. The governor extolled the contribution of Pa Ayomike to art, saying he contributed immensely to the development of choral music in Nigeria. He also noted that the deceased was passionate about classical music, “espousing the beauty, panache and symphony that animate life and living.” “He will be remembered for his intriguing personality and commitment to the development of his local community,” Obaseki added.
