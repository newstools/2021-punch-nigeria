Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has ruled defender William Troost-Ekong and Jamilu Collins out of the secondly friendly match against Cameroon on Tuesday. Rohr confirmed that both players picked up injuries in the Eagles 1-0 loss to the Indomitable Lions at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt, Vienna, Austria on Friday. Speaking after the game, Rohr said the injury might force him to use a three-man defence for the second game of the double-header against Cameroon. Rohr, who lamented the inability of his team to find the net, said it was a good game to test his squad before the 2022 World Cup qualifiers in September. “It was very interesting to see some new players, we missed about seven or eight players and we had to manage the situation. We had 17 shots on goal while they only had three with one on target, which was the goal,” Rohr said. “Our domination was not good enough, it was not realistic enough because we had to score at the beginning of the game and we did not. And when you don’t score, very often, you concede a goal, which was what happened. We had a good integration of the players, with three of them playing for the first time. “Unfortunately, we lost two players to injury, which will make it difficult for the second game in the defence because Troost- Ekong and Collins are out, they cannot play. So, we have to manage the difficult situation. But it’s also an opportunity to play with three defenders only and to change the system to try something different, that’s why we are happy to play the second game. “The result is not the most important thing in a friendly game, the most important thing is to see some interesting things, to test some new players and for the competition to be efficient.” Copyright PUNCH.
