The Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Ishaq Oloyede, has disclosed that a second Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination may be conducted in 2021 for candidates with genuine registration hitches. Oloyede, made this known on Wednesday in Lagos while monitoring the profiling of candidates facing registration challenges for the 2021 UTME. “So far, we have just 17, 758 candidates with challenges that have been profiled, nationwide. “At the end of the entire exercise, we may have to conduct another examination for those with genuine cases after the main UTME slated for June 19 to July 3,” he said. He emphasised that the board is committed to ensure that Nigerian youths would be given an equal opportunity and access to tertiary education. “Since I came here this morning and  interacted with candidates, I have discovered that most of them are largely unserious and are basically the cause of most of their challenges. “We keep hearing flimsy excuses such as my lesson teacher used his phone to generate the profile code, our tutorial centre helped us to register and I was not in town. “Other reasons advanced are:  I used my mother’s NIN to generate my profile code or my mummy did the registration for me,” he said. The registrar pointed out that some candidates genuinely did not have money to procure UTME  forms. (NAN)
