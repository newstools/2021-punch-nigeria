An e-commerce platform, Dukashops has expressed its commitment to solve problems associated with online trading being experienced by residents of Port Harcourt and other parts of Rivers State. Chief Executive Officer of Dukashops, Mr Kennedy Ehimare, stated this during a chat with newsmen in Port Harcourt, shortly after an event to unveil the platform. Ehimare said Dukashops was a Nigerian multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace where goods and services were displayed online for buyers and sellers to do business. He stated that the platform would serve as a viable option for customers to choose from, adding that the company aimed to give a face-lift to e-commerce in the country and to solve problems about other platforms. Ehimare  said, “Dukashops is a multi-vendor e-commerce platform specially designed for Nigerians, including shop owners, drop shippers, wholesalers, retailers, SME and all different kinds of sellers and where they can sell their services and products online. “The purpose of building Dukashop is not to compete with other brands. We have an idea; we sit before computer and then turn that idea into something that solves a problem. That is the idea of Bukashops. “The world is free and we had other brands before us. The purpose is to solve a problem. We found out that sellers don’t really have where to sell things in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
