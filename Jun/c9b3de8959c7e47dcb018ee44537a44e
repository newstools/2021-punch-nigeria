The suspension of the House of Representatives member from Kano Municipal federal constituency, Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada, has been affirmed by the All Progressives Congress. The lawmaker was suspended for creating chaos in the state and also for allegedly insulting the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. Sharada’s suspension which was issued by the APC in his ward was affirmed by a letter signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the party in the Kano Municipal local government, Alhaji Sani Abubakar Maifata and Kamilu Saidu Bala, respectively. “We affirm the Suspension of Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada who was suspended at his ward level for 12 months, for his open attack and castigation of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and other APC stalwarts,” Maifata said. According to Maifata and Bala, a seven-man disciplinary committee was set up following the letter of suspension from Sharada’s ward. The lawmaker who failed to honour the committee’s invite was found guilty of the allegations against him. “After going through their reports and evidence attached to the suspension letter by the ward executives, the committee confirmed that Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada has been found guilty of all the charges against him. “He is guilty of assassination of the characters of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and party executives at the Ward, Local and State levels. “The assertions by Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada may instigate chaos and Turmoil in the State which may disrupt and distract the positive missions of Governor Ganduje. “They may also derogate the dignity of the party executives to their subjects in addition to party loss of supporters at the grassroots level. “We hereby affirm the suspension of Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada for the period of 12 months, during which he will not interfere in any of the affairs or activities of the party at all levels,” Sha’aban’s suspension letter reads.
