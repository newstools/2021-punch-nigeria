Arla Foods, makers of Dano Milk, has announced that it will build a state-of-the-art commercial dairy farm in Northern Nigeria where it plans to train and support up to 1,000 local dairy farmers as part of its long term commitment to develop the Nigerian dairy sector. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said that the 200-hectare farm is located in Kaduna State and is scheduled to open in 2022. It disclosed that it would house 400 dairy cows, modern milking parlours and technology, grass lands and living facilities for 25 employees. Over time, the farm is expected to produce more than 10 tonnes of milk per day. In addition to providing training and support, the farm will also showcase modern commercial farming in Nigeria. The firm’s Managing Director in Nigeria, Peder Pedersen, said, “There is a great need for nutritious food and dairy products to satisfy the growing demand from Nigeria’s fast growing population. “This requires a complementary approach where imported food is crucial to ensure food security while also supporting the government’s long-term agricultural transformation plan to build a sustainable dairy sector in Nigeria.
