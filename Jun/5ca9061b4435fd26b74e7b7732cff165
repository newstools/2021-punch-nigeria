The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba on Monday announced the immediate suspension of tinted vehicle permits and issuance of SPY plate numbers in the country. According to him, some mischievous persons have capitalised on the license to commit heinous crimes. He also announced the arrest of 686 high profile suspects in two months during various police operations across the country. The IGP, who announced this in Abuja during a meeting with the top echelon of police officers, including DIGs and Commissioners from across the states, also reiterated that roadblocks remain banned in the country. He warned that heads of commands must enforce it and key into the road patrol strategy as an alternative to roadblocks. Baba said, “Henceforth, the issuance of SPY plate numbers and tainted glasses permits are hereby suspended. The existing authorisations are being reviewed and a protocol to regulate the issuance of such permits will be evolved. “An emerging trend in which some motorists cover their plate numbers has also been noticed across the country. This practice inhibits our law enforcement operations and hence, is intolerable. Consequently, Commissioners of Police are tasked to, as part of their operations, arrest any motorist involved in this act.” The IGP also said the police arrested 686 high profile suspects in two months. He said, “Between April and May, 2021, a total of 686 high-profile suspects have been arrested during various police operations across the country. The arrested suspects comprise mainly of bandits, kidnappers, and armed robbers. They also include the principal suspects involved in the attack on Governor Samuel Ortom on March 20, 2021.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
