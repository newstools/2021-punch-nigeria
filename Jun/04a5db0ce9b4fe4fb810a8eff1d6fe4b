Players of Sunshine Stars of Akure on Tuesday were paid one month salary ahead of their Nigeria Professional Football League clash against Dakkada at the Akure Township Stadium on Wednesday (today), The PUNCH has learnt. Prior to the payment, the Owena Whales players and officials were owed eight months salaries, which has affected the form of the team. Sunshine are currently 19th on the NPFL log, following their 2-1 defeat away to Warri Wolves at the Delta State Polytechnic Sports Complex, Ozoro, Sunday. It’s their 19th game without a win in the topflight. Goals from Mark Daniel and another from Walter Igho secured maximum points for Wolves, despite Fuad Ekelojuoti’s late goal for the visitors. One of the club’s players, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, “I just got the alert but it’s not enough to motivate us to fight against relegation, “he said. “There’s still seven months to be paid, which also include bonuses. But we will do our best to ensure we get a win against Dakkada.” With 13 games left to play in the NPFL, newly appointed coach Deji Ayeni expressed confidence that Sunshine will avoid the drop despite picking just eight points from a possible 57 in their last 19 games. “We are eager to end this poor run which will go a long way to reduce the pressure,” Ayeni told The PUNCH. “Everything is possible. Nobody gave Liverpool a chance to finish among the top four clubs in the Premier League, just as no one gave Chelsea a chance against Manchester City in the final of the Champions League. So, nothing is impossible in football. All we need now is reorientation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
