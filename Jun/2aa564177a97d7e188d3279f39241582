THE Ondo chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has alleged that it was yet to be given copies of the Appeal Court judgment dismissing its challenge to the electoral victory of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. The appellate court, sitting in Akure, last week upheld Akeredolu’s victory in the October 20 Governorship Election. It dismissed the appeal filed by the PDP and its governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, against Akeredolu’s victory for lack of merit. Earlier, the Election Petition Tribunal had struck out Jegede’s petition. In a statement signed by the Ondo PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kennedy Peretei, in Akure, on Sunday, alleged that the copies of the judgment were yet to be made available to either the party or its candidate. The statement read in part, “The Ondo State chapter of the PDP is surprised that our application to the Office of the Registrar, Court of Appeal, to get the certified true copies of the judgment has been met with some kind of buck passing between officials of the court in Ado-Ekiti and Akure.” Similarly, a statement issued by the Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation urged the judiciary to ensure that “this anomaly is immediately corrected, so as not to send a wrong signal to the public about the independence of our judiciary.” The spokesman for the group, Mr. Gbenga Akinmoyo,  expressed optimism that Jegede would obtain a true verdict at the apex court but called for the intervention of appropriate authorities in releasing the judgment’s copies, saying, “any further delay could affect the filing of the appeal to be heard within the stipulated 60 days.” Copyright PUNCH.
