A nursing school, Ezeala College of Nursing, has opened for admission in Umuseke-Okwudor, in the Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State. According to the institution’s registrar, Austin Igbojekwe, the college is among the few nursing schools in the country with dual accreditation which it secured within two years. “We realise that there are thousands of young Nigerians who are denied admission due to few available nursing schools in the country. With our institution in place, prospective and qualified undergraduates have an opportunity for admission because of the excellent facilities in place, high moral standards the college is set to uphold, as well as the competence of the academic personnel,” he added. Igbojekwe explained that graduates of the school could earn certificates, including Registered Nurse, Registered Midwife, Ordinary Diploma and Higher National Diploma. On admission requirements, he said students with five credits in not more than two sittings in either the West African Senior School Certificate Examination or the National Examination Council were eligible to apply.
