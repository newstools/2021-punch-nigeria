A former deputy president of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, has urged the governors in the region and the leadership of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, to urgently convene a security summit. Ekweremadu, in a statement on Wednesday, said the summit should target ways of addressing the growing insecurity and tension in Igbo land. The Senator said he had in the past, initiated various solutions to curb the unfortunate development in the region but lamented that the current regime in the country, ignored them all. Part of the statement reads, “Once again, I call on Ohanaeze and the South East Governors Forum to immediately convene a meeting of South-East leaders to genuinely dialogue and find solutions to the increasing level of insecurity in the South East and also offer solutions to the security situation nationwide. “Nevertheless, it is imperative to underscore the fact that the rising insecurity and agitations in the South-East are not peculiar to the region. It sadly has become a national new normal. From the North-West to North-Central, North-East, South-West, South-East, and South-South, there is a conflagration of insecurity, crises, and all forms of restiveness and separatist agitations. “Pragmatic leadership and patriotism are needed at this time. We need to rally Nigerians, and come together as leaders to provide solutions and not trade blames or seek to make political capital out of what is clearly capable of consuming the entire nation, including even any political ambitions by anyone.” Ekweremadu described as cheap blackmail, allegations by some people that the Igbo leaders have kept silent while the killings and arson continued unabated in the region.
