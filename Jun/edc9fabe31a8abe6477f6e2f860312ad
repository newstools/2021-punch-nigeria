The All Progressives Grand Alliance, has disqualified a former aide to Ex-President, Goodluck Jonathan, Chief Akachukwu Nwamkpo, from participating in the party’s Anambra State Governorship primary scheduled for June 23. Nwampo, served as Jonathan’s adviser on Technical Matters and Secretary of the Presidential Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme. The disqualification was contained in a memo signed by APGA’s National Organising Secretary, Ifeanyi Mbaeri. The memo stated that Nwampo, was disqualified for failing to meet the criteria of being a card carrying and financial member of the party for at least 18 months. He also failed to get a waiver from the party’s NWC as required by the party’s constitution. Others who were also disqualified are: a member of the House of Representatives and a House of Assembly member, Chuma Umeoji and Nonso Okafor respectively. Others are: Ifeanyi Uzoka and Carter Dike-Umeh. They were disqualified for offences bordering on improper nomination, defiance and insubordination to the party. The memo read in part, “This cast a dark shadow of doubt on the genuineness and credibility of their APGA membership.” The screening committee however cleared a former Central Bank Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, Damian Okolo, ThankGod Ibe, and Okwudili Ezenwankwo to contest in the primary. The Organising Secretary said those disqualified were at liberty to exercise their rights of appeal in writing, subject to a veto by the party’s National Working Committee. Copyright PUNCH.
