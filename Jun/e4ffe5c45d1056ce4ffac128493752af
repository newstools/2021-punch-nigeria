SHOP owners and technicians doing business at the popular GSM village at the Garrison axis of Ogbunabali in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, have been forced to shut down, following the killing of an unidentified man by a suspected vigilante member. Recall that the yet-to-be identified shop owner was killed after a leader in Ogbunabali community, allegedly invited members of the vigilante group known as OSPAC to the area. According to sources, the vigilante prevented the man, who they alleged was a cultist, from entering the market, leading to an altercation during which he was shot dead by the OSPAC member. Since last Wednesday when the incident happened, traders said some marksmen stormed the area, shooting indiscriminately and causing pandemonium in the process, even as it was learnt that the gunmen returned on Thursday at about 7pm for what many believed was a reprisal. The sources further said the marksmen stormed the area on Saturday as their presence caused panic among traders and other business operators. The state Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, has ordered for the arrest of the vigilante, who pulled the trigger as well as those who invited the local security outfit. Copyright PUNCH.
