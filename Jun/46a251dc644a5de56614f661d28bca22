Suspected Fulani herdsmen have reportedly killed one and kidnapped six, including a woman in Agu-Amede community in Eha-Amufu, Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State. The PUNCH gathered that the abductors have communicated the affected families, demanding a ransom of N10m. A community source told our correspondent on Monday that the incident happened around 7pm on Wednesday, June 9 at Pipeline along Eha-Amufu – Ikem – Nsukka Federal Road. He gave the name of the one killed as Odo Francis Ugochukwu. According to the source, out of the N10m being demanded by the abductors, the community has only been able to raise N230,000 which was paid on Friday. The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Daniel Ndukwe, said, “Please send your enquiry about the incident in text message.” Meanwhile, suspected herdsmen on Sunday killed one Silvanus Usen, in a dawn attack on Ikot Atasung community in Ikot Ikpene LGA, Akwa Ibom State. A source told our correspondent on Monday that elders of the community prevented a reprisal on the Hausa community in the area. Chairman of the council, Unyime Etim, said, “The Victims were hunters who usually set traps in the bush and getting to check their traps in the morning, they met the herdsmen and their cattle grazing in their farms. “When they persuaded the herders to leave, the herdsmen attacked one of the victims and he died on the spot.” The State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, said, “Investigations into the incident has commenced.” Copyright PUNCH.
