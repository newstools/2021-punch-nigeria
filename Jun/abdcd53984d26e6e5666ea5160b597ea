American cruiserweight star Brandon Glanton has vowed to knock out Nigerian Efetobor Apochi in round five if both fighters get to meet again in the future. Apochi suffered his first professional loss to Glanton, via split decision, in a bout that has been termed candidate for the ‘Fight of The Year’ at the Armory in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Monday. In a keenly-contested fight that went the entire 10 rounds, Judge Nelson Vazquez (96-93) saw Apochi as the winner, his score was overruled by judges John Mariano (95-94) and Mike Fitzgerald (95-94) who ruled in favour of Glanton. The fight turned out explosive from the sound of the bell as both boxers went to work but it was Glanton who almost got the better of Apochi in the sixth round. The American connected a left hook to the Nigerian’s head but the ropes saved him from going down, so it was ruled a knockdown. The-33-year-old Nigerian recovered to complete the fight, but he never fought to maximum capacity after the knockdown. Apochi had the final say, rocking Glanton inside of the final 15 seconds but was unable to land that final blow to provide a dramatic finish. The loss means Apochi has lost his place as challenger for the WBA cruiserweight belt as his record falls to 11-1 (11KOs) while Glanton improves his record to 14-0 (11KOs). Reacting to the win on Instagram, Brandon promised to knock out the Nigerian in the fifth round if they clash again. He wrote, “This boy is making excuses less than 24hours later… you’re old news @efetoborapochi and if I bless you and give you a rematch I’ll KO you in 5! Stop playing with me! I told you beforehand to respect my name!” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
