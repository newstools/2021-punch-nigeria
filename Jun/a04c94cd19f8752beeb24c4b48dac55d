Wolves midfielder Joao Moutinho knows holders Portugal will have more to worry about than just trying to stop Manchester City maestro Kevin De Bruyne when they face Belgium for a place in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020. The Red Devils have lived up to their number-one FIFA world ranking as they qualified for the last 16 top of Group B with three victories, scoring seven goals and conceding just once. De Bruyne, who underwent surgery on the facial injury suffered during City’s Champions League final defeat to Chelsea, capped another impressive display with a superb finish in the 2-1 win over Denmark in Copenhagen. Portugal duo Bernardo Silva and Ruben Dias will be among those out to keep their club-mate quiet in Seville on Sunday evening – but Moutinho is all too aware of the collective threat of Roberto Martinez’s squad. “Belgium are very compact team, they have shown that during the group stage, they score goals and do not concede many goals,” Moutinho said at a press conference. “But we will try to impose our game and our strengths on them and take advantage of any lapses. Our goal is to come away with a victory.” Moutinho added: “Belgium is not just Kevin De Bruyne. Of course he is an amazing player, if we give him enough time and space to think, to play, he is even more dangerous. “Kevin is a finisher as well, he does everything very perfectly, but we cannot focus on just one player, we have to concentrate on all of them. “Belgium are a very strong team, and if we give all of them too much space, they will play their game very calmly and that will make our job that much harder. “We have to pay close attention to each and every one of them, and will try to keep them at bay. “We also need to think about ourselves, to highlight our assets and be better than they are.”
