Gunmen have abducted the Eleda of Eda Ile in Ekiti East Local Government Areaof Ekiti State, Oba Benjamin Oso. The gunmen were said to have whisked the traditional ruler away from his farm in the presence of his wife on Friday evening. The incident happened barely two months after another monarch, the Obadu of Ilemeso Ekiti in the Oye Local Government Area of the state, Oba David Oyewumi, was abducted from his palace. The Commander, Ekiti State Amotekun Corps, Brig Joe Komolafe, confirmed the abduction, but said, “All the security outfits in Ekiti, including police, soldiers, Amotekun Corps, local hunters and vigilance groups, are already in the forests searching for the monarch. We are on their trail.” This was as the police disclosed the arrest of 14 members of a suspected kidnap gang that allegedly abducted a student of Crown Polytechnic, Odo, Ado Ekiti. Ekiti State Police Commissioner, Tunde Mobayo, said, “It was reported that a gang of suspected kidnappers sneaked into the hostel apartment of the victim, blindfolded him and whisked him away to an unknown destination.” Copyright PUNCH.
