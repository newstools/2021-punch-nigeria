THE Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has reassured the people of the state, of his administration’s commitment, towards ensuring that every part of the state enjoys government presence in terms of projects and service delivery. This was contained in a Government House statement, in Benin, on Wednesday. The statement was silent about the nature of the meeting and who the governor met. It however said the governor expressed gratitude to the people of the state for their support. He was quoted as saying, “I am here to thank all of you for your various roles played in the September 19, 2020 gubernatorial election, which led us to victory. You voted us unanimously and returned us to power for another four years. “The election was a victory for Edo people, as it shows you can all stand together for one purpose. Politically, the election has shown that we know what we are doing and where we are going. The victory comes with a lot of responsibility, which is why we have not rushed to form our government.” Obaseki further said, “It’s time to make our political appointments. Our political arrangements now are a win-win situation; one to benefit our people. Politics in Edo is different now and my political leaders should also be my economic leaders. “Our people are expecting so much from us; we need the support and commitment from all party members to enable us work and deliver services to our people. We have resources to attain any level of development in Edo State, but there are too many leakages in our revenue system.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
