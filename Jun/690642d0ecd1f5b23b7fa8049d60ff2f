The Nigerian Railway Corporation, the Nigerian Society for Engineers, and the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi have announced a plan to partner for the local production of railway spare parts. This effort, the group said, would see to the creation of end-to-end framework from analysis and identification through test to patenting and commercialisation and production of critical spare parts for the maintenance of the railway infrastructure. They said this on Wednesday at NRC’s headquarters in Ebute Metta during a meeting themed, ‘Local manufacturing of spare parts for railway maintenance’ and the formal inauguration of the team called the ‘tripartite working group’. The Ikeja Branch Chairman of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, Tosin Ogunmola, in his opening remark emphasised that this was the third visit of NSE to NRC on the proposed partnership. He said, “This event signposts the commitment of critical stakeholders to local content development in the very important sector of rail transportation.” Also speaking at the event, the Managing Director, Nigerian Railway Corporation, pledged to give the collaboration the needed support.
