Suspected assassins in the early hours of Wednesday invaded Lamba village in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State, and killed a Fulani leader, Alhaji Abdullahi Hardo-Buruku. The PUNCH gathered that the victim, popularly known as Alhaji Malam, was shot dead in his room while asleep. A resident of Lamba, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the assailants stormed the town around 12midnight and shot into the air sporadically to scare people before entering the victim’s room, where they met three people. “They shot him on the spot. We heard gunshots all over,” he said. Also, a sister of the deceased, Aina’u Hardo-Buruku, who confirmed the incident, said the gunmen met the victim in his bedroom and murdered him. Until his death, the deceased was the Chairman, Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria, Kwara State branch. Abdullahi was the eldest son of the late Sarkin Fulani of Kwara, Alhaji Mu’azu Hardo-Buruku. The Public Relations Officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kwara State Command, Babawale Afolabi, said only the victim was killed. He said, “They only assassinated the deceased person; they didn’t ask for anything from him. The deceased person was asleep with two other persons when they shot him in the chest, which caused his death.” Afolabi said though the killers did not take anything from the deceased’s room, they broke into some provision shops and stole drinks before they left the village.
