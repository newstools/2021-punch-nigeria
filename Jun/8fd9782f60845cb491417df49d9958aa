The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged the Federal Government to provide adequate funding for the construction of the Lagos-Badagry Express way, saying it serves as a trans-West African route. Sanwo-Olu said this on Monday while receiving the House of Representatives Committee on Works, led by its Chairman, Abubakar Kabir Abubakar, during a courtesy visit to the Lagos House, Ikeja. Sanwo-Olu, who noted that urgent action should be taken on the Otedola Bridge area of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway to prevent regular accidents, added that the Lagos-Badagry Expressway was not fully fixed in spite of being an international gateway into five neighbouring countries. He said, “Lagos-Badagry expressway is one that I am aware of that doesn’t have sufficient funding. This is an international gateway. We heard that Ghana, Republic of Benin and Togo have done their own; it is trans West Africa corridor which five countries pass through. But it is only the Nigerian part of it that has not been fully fixed, which is from Seme border into Lagos and to the port.” Sanwo-Olu also disclosed that his administration has already worked on 18 kilometres of the highway, appealing to the Federal Government to extend it to Badagry. He said, “Our desire is for them to make it 10-lanes highway. We are building for the future and we can put a rail in the middle of the corridor. It is an international road and it has capacity to take high level of traffic.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
