Ex-international, Henry Nwosu, has backed Portugal to overcome Belgium in their Euro 2020 clash on Sunday (today). Holders Portugal face world No.1 Belgium in Seville for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition in a potentially explosive match. In a chat with The PUNCH, Nwosu, the youngest member of Nigeria’s victorious 1980 African Cup of Nations squad says he is emotionally attached to the Portuguese. “I wish Portugal win the match, I have been a fan of Portugal from the start of the competition. I am not looking at this match from the tactical angle but from the emotional aspect. Belgium are a solid team as well with lots of very good players. What we should expect is a very tough match but I hope Portugal can win,” Nwosu told The PUNCH. Another ex-Eagles star Godfrey Oboabona, a 2013 AFCON winner, is however backing Belgium to overcome the Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portuguese. “I think Belgium will win the game because I see them as a more compact team with depth. They have the hunger to succeed and they have more players that can easily punish Portugal, stars like Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku,” Oboabona said. “It is going to be a tough game for them notwithstanding. Ronaldo is another player to look at. He can singlehandedly change the direction of a match, but I think Belgium will overpower them. “Belgium have impressed everyone but Portugal have had a mixed campaign especially their loss to Germany,” Oboabona added.
