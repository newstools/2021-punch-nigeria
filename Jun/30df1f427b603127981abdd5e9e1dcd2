There was a mild drama in Osogbo after participants in the Democracy Day protest expressed a preference for different venues. While a group of protesters said it would not be participating in a lecture organised by the Osun State Government in collaboration with the Civil Societies Coalition, others prefered to be part of the lecture. During the heated debate, some of the protesters claimed that going to the lecture is a means to stop the ongoing protest. However, others argued that it was better to continue the protest at the lecture venue. The protest had started on a peaceful note as the participants moved from Oke Fia, Osogbo to Olaiya Area, chanting anti-oppression songs. They also demand good governance in the country. Division however surfaced in the ranks of the protesters, when some participants declined to go to an event centre where a lecture was billed to hold in commemoration of the day. While some of the protesters chose to remain around the Oke Fia roundabout, others moved to the Lameco Area in continuation of the protest. The PUNCH had reported that members of Osun Civil Societies Coalition joined by students under the aegis of National Association of Nigerian Students held a protest in Osogbo, Osun state capital in commemoration of June 12 Democracy Day. The protest held under the watchful eyes of men of Amotekun Corps and police operatives started in Oke Fia Area of Osogbo as leaders of the groups took a turn to address the participants. One of the conveners, Comrade Waheed Saka, lamented hardship ravaging the country under the current dispensation and demanded the resignation of the president, Maj.-Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).
