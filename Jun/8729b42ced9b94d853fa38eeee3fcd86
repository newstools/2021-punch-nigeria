A media organisation, Signature TV, has called on the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission to probe some staff of the National Examination Council for engaging in examination malpractices at a centre in Kaduna State. The Chief Executive Officer of the station, Mr Vinmartin Ilo, stated this during the inauguration of a TV show, Corruption Tori Season Two, in Abuja. A statement on Thursday said Corruption Tori is an anti-corruption programme supported by the MacArthur Foundation and aired on the network services of the African Independent Television and the Nigerian Television Authority to cause attitudinal change and make Nigerians demand accountability and transparency from leaders. Ilo in his remark at the event explained that the station recently uncovered how some NECO officials colluded with prospective candidates to undermine the integrity of their examination. He said, “The story, which was published by more than 25 media houses a day after it broke, led to the flagging up of the examination centre in Kaduna by NECO and an investigative enquiry was set up by the NECO board.” The media owner lamented that despite NECO’s promise to send its findings to the ICPC for further investigation, nothing had been heard of the case again. He called on the anti-corruption agency to wade into the case and bring anyone culpable to justice. Speaking at the event on the topic, ‘Corruption Fighting Back,’ the ICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, who was represented by an assistant director, Mr Hassan Salihu, said it was only natural for those who benefited from the status quo to oppose any reform aimed at fighting corruption.
