Kennedy Boboye, head coach of Nigeria Professional Football League side, Akwa United, has described his side’s stunning run of form as incredible, The PUNCH reports. The Uyo-based club made a slow start to the 2020/21 season, but after a match-day 10 2-1 loss to Nasarawa United on February 14, they embarked on a 15-game unbeaten run – eight wins and seven draws – the longest in the history of the league. The impressive run of form saw them surpass Enyimba’s 14-match unbeaten run, as well as put them back on track for the league title, much to the delight of the gaffer. “The 15-game unbeaten run is something we all thought of doing as a team and we are delighted to have been able to achieve that,” Boboye told The PUNCH. “But adding to it is to find a way to win the league because playing 15 games and going unbeaten and not at the top or not winning the league makes no sense. We have succeeded in one of our targets (which was to surpass Enyimba’s 14) and we are all happy. The second target is to win the league.” He added, “I’m happy with the performance of the players; they are in good shape and have been trying to put in their best. We’ve had minor issues like lack of concentration, which also showed in our last game against Wikki Tourist when we conceded an unnecessary goal. But we are going to improve on that and see how we can score goals and not concede.” Akwa United currently sit second on the NPFL table with 46 points after 25 matches and will hope to improve on their new record when they host Heartland at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Thursday.
