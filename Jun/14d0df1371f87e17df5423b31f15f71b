Fidelity Bank Plc has said it plans to enrich 15 Nigerians with N39m at the final draw of the Get Alert in Millions Campaign Season 4 savings promo in July. It said this in a statement titled ‘Fidelity GAIM season 4 final draw to hold on July’ on Thursday. The savings promotion, which was specifically aimed at promoting the culture of saving among Nigerians, was one of the bank’s initiatives aimed at rewarding new and existing customers for their loyalty and patronage. Despite the fact that the promotion was halted in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting global lockdown, hundreds of Nigerians had benefited from the unique reward scheme in which lucky customers were credited with millions of naira and consolation prizes via a draw system. The Chairman, Promo Committee, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mr Richard Madiebo, expressed his delight at the resumption of the savings promotion. He stated that the campaign sought to reward customers for their loyalty and patronage. According to Madiebo, for the past 12 years, the bank had empowered new and existing customers, providing an avenue for many to change their fortunes through its savings promo. He said the bank took pride in keeping its promises, adding that the lender would continue to look out for innovative ways to satisfy and enrich its customers across the nation. Copyright PUNCH.
