The Industrial Training Fund says it has trained a total of 25 million Nigerians on various skill acquisition programmes since it was established in 1971. The House of Representatives Committee on Industry applauded the ITF for empowering Nigerians through various skill acquisition programmes, which are aimed at self-reliance and poverty reduction in the country. They gave the commendation in Jos when the Chairman of the Committee, Enitan Badru, led other members on an oversight function at the ITF recently. The Director General, ITF, Mr Joseph Ari, during the visit, said since the inception of the incumbent management in the ITF in 2016, its commitment to equipping Nigerians with technical skills for employability and entrepreneurship had not waned. Ari said, “I am pleased to note that the ITF has discharged it with great success by training over 25 million Nigerians that are manning key sectors of the national economy in its 50-year history. “Our emphasis on skills acquisition has been premised on our firm belief that it remains the most sustainable solution to increasing poverty and unemployment, and the catalyst to economic growth and development. “One outcome of our efforts was the production of the first indigenous Android GSM Smartphone with 100 per cent locally sourced materials by the ITF Model Skills Training Centre, Abuja.” According to him, the device, which was presented recently by the Minister of the Federal Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, to the President, Major General Muhammad Buhari (retd.), is comparable in quality to any available android device in the market.
