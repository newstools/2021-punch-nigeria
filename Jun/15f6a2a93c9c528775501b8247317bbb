Paga has said it processed N1tn in transaction values in 15 months. The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Tayo Oviosu, disclosed this on Monday in a tweet celebrating the company’s processing of over N3tn since it began operations in 2012. He said, “Big milestone for Paga @mypaga and digital acceleration. We crossed N3tn in transaction values processed since the start of commercial operations in 2012. Hit N2tn in March 2020. Hit N3tn in May 2021. 15 months to process N1tn.” Paga is a mobile payment company with over 17 million customers, and 27 thousand agents, according to its website. In 2020, Visa partnered with Paga on payments and technology – a partnership that allowed Paga account holders to transact on Visa’s global network, while both companies worked together on tech. This partnership was expected to drive larger payment volumes for both companies. According to a report on TechCrunch, Paga is pivoting towards becoming less of a Nigeria-centered company and more an emerging markets fintech platform. In January 2020, the company acquired Ethiopian software development company Apposit, with plans to launch in the East African country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
