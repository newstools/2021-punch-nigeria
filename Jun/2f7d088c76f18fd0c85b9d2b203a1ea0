A 500-level student of the Faculty of Law, Olasubomi Olopade, on Wednesday became the vice Chancellor of Bowen University. Olopade’s tenure would last for just one day for which he would be paid.. Olopade, who ran the affairs of the university on Wednesday, emerged the winner of a competition, One Day VC,’ which involved a series of screening, essay competition and manifesto presentation. The students who came second and third, Ibunkunoluwa Areo, a 400-level student of Economics Department; and James Joshua, a 400-level student of Statistics Department, assisted Olopade as the deputy vice chancellors Academics, and Research and Outreach respectively. The one-day VC, in an interview after a church service held in his honour, said he contested in the first edition, but could not make it beyond the best five contestants. He said he applied again this year and eventually became the winner. Olopade said, “This is an opportunity to serve my colleagues and display the leadership skills I have imbibed. “Our politicians usually tell us that the youth are the leaders of tomorrow and that is when they a begging for votes but after that, it ends. But the truth is the youth should be partners with the leaders now. I am.not calling for eradication of the elders but the youth should be given opportunities to showcase their talents.” A 400-level student of Medicine and Surgery, Mayomikun Olawale, won the 2020 contest at the maiden edition. The substantive VC, Prof Joshua Ogunwole, had told our correspondent that he introduced the concept of one-day VC to give students practical exposure to leadership. Copyright PUNCH.
