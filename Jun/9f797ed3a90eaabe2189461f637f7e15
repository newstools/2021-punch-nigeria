Some Nigerians on Twitter have expressed their anger at the warnings by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to treat promoters of insurrection in a language they will understand. In a statement on Tuesday, the President had said, “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” This statement did not go down well with many Nigerians as they have reacted to the President’s statement. Human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, tweeted, “Someone needs to tell Buhari that this is not the era of the 60s and that the government no longer has a monopoly of violence.” A tweep, @ochuksk, asked, “What has stopped him from treating Boko Haram and killer herdsmen in that language since he understands it in the last 6 years?” Another tweep, @basedon_believe, also asked, “And you cannot treat bandits, Boko Haram and corruption with the language they understand?” @krisabah tweeted, “Deadly force could harden the secessionists and legitimise their demands. Try and have a discussion. Listen to their demands.” @ikechukwumogaha asked, “Why not channel that energy to insecurity and other issues of Nigeria?” Expressing shock, @emmaikumeh tweeted, “Never in my life did I ever believe that the President of my country would be threatening citizens from the South East on social media with civil war treatment. “Meanwhile, President Buhari has never spoken this tough to killer Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram and bandits,” the user wrote.
