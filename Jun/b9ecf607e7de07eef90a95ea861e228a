GUNMEN suspected to be bandits have reportedly killed three young men in Danmusa Local Government Area of Katsina State. Residents said the gunmen shot at a Golf 3 commercial car travelling from Yantumaki to Danmusa on Sunday night, killing two men identified as Sulaiman and Nura Dogon Gida, in the process. A member of a vigilante group in Yantumaki, who also confirmed the incident, said it happened shortly after the vehicle left for Danmusa. The vigilante member said the vehicle left Yantumaki few minutes after 7 pm. He said, “What we learnt was that the driver was asked to stop by the bandits but when he noticed that they were not policemen, he decided to speed off which made them fire at the moving vehicle.” It was further learnt that when vigilante members and some policemen attracted to the scene of the incident by the gunshots arrived there, the gunmen escaped to a nearby village called Unguwar Kukoki, where they reportedly killed another man identified as Surajo Muhammad, who was said to be a bakery manager in Danmusa town. The gunmen were also said to have kidnapped a businessman identified as Audu Buzu. The spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, Gambo Isah, has yet to respond to the SMS sent to him for clarification on the incident after calls to his phone were not answered. Copyright PUNCH.
