The Bible Society of Nigeria has said it is set to dedicate 35 chronological Bible stories in Nigerian sign language for the deaf. A statement by the BSN Media Manager, Benjamin Mordi, on Tuesday added that the move was part of its commitment to make the word of God accessible to the deaf community. “The event will take place on June 19, 2021, in Ibadan, Oyo State, where the BSN has a deaf translation centre. “The sign language Bible, which is in video format and available in memory stick, is designed to meet the scriptural needs of those with hearing challenges. The Bible stories, though expensive, are distributed free of charge to the deaf community,” the statement added. It recalled that the first 77 Bible stories for the deaf were dedicated in 2014 while 33 more stories were added in 2017. “The dedication of additional 35 stories will bring the total chronological Bible stories in the Nigerian sign language to 145,” the statement said.
