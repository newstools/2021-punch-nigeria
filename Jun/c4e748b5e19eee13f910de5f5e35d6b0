THE Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has rejected an Abuja Federal High Court judgement which sacked the party executive, on Wednesday. Embattled party chairman, Ndubuisi Nwobu, who addressed a press conference at the state PDP Secretariat on Thursday, accused those he described as political merchants of orchestrating the judgement. Nwobu said, “Our attention has been drawn to a court judgement delivered via zoom, which purportedly sacked this executive. We want to tell you there is nothing of such, and it cannot stand. “I want to tell you that there was another judgment on 24 May 2018, by Justice AO Musa of the FCT high court. That judgement clearly stated the process in which we emerged, and it stated that we fulfilled all the processes, and we were duly elected. “We have taken notice of the efforts of political merchants and in a short while, those who are bent on being fifth columnists will hear from us. “Let it be known that the said judgement is of no substance and does not avail the plaintiffs of any right whatsoever being inconsistent with a valid judgement of a court of coordinate jurisdiction. “In view of the foregoing, we appeal to the Anambra State PDP family, supporters and aspirants to go about their political activities without let or hindrance.” Copyright PUNCH.
