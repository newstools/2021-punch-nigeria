THE Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, has appealed to the party’s national leadership, to approve a one-week extension to enable it register defectors from opposition political parties. State APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Abdullahi Samari, said this in a statement in Ilorin, on Sunday. He said, “You would recall that thousands of people from the opposition PDP, Labour Party, ACPN and others have recently joined our party in the state. “We appeal that the registration exercise be extended by at least one week for them to be formally registered as party members. “This will also enable those who could not register or revalidate their membership status before for whatever reasons to do so. “Our party, the APC, is gaining new entrants every day. This is because of the people-focused programmes of the government and the fact that the governor has been a friend of the masses who reaches out to everyone in the larger interest of the state. “We therefore urge the national secretariat of our party, to extend the registration and of course revalidation exercise by one week.” Copyright PUNCH.
