Suspected herdsmen from Igangan in Oyo State, on Monday night, reportedly stormed Imeko, Ogun State and killed three hunters. The herdsmen were said to have left Igangan, a few kilometres away and invaded a community in Imeko, Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of the state. They were reportedly resisted by hunters in the area from wreaking havoc. Our correspondent gathered that three of the hunters reportedly lost their lives in the gun duel between them and the herdsmen. A source in the area told our correspondent that residents of the area are now apprehensive about the incident. The source said the operatives of the security outfit launched by the state government last month asked the hunters to face the herdsmen while they went to sleep. The source said, “Three hunters were killed overnight by Fulani herdsmen that left Igangan.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi said the command was not aware of the incident.
