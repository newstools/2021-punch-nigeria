A man and his four children on Thursday escaped death as a two-storey building collapsed in Amawbia, Awka South Local Government Area of Anambra State. The building located along Amawbia bypass was said to be serving as both residential and business facility. The incident occurred in the wee hours of Thursday. A victim, Mr Augustine Ikeji said the building collapsed following a rainstorm. “The debris fell on me and four of my children while we were sleeping in our room close to the collapsed portion of the building. “Some of my property was destroyed while my kids sustained varying degrees of injury and were rushed to hospital.” Another resident, who pleaded not to be named, blamed the collapse on use of inferior building materials by the developer. The Managing Director, Awka Capital Territory Development Authority, Amaechi Okwuosa , said the agency had sealed up the facility. He said, “Though the owner may have gotten approval more than fifteen years ago, the structure was substandard.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
