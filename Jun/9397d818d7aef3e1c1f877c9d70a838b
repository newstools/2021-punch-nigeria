Bandits on Tuesday killed four policemen and a member of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Gora-Namaye village, in the Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State. The bandits also injured one policeman and set ablaze a patrol vehicle belonging to the police. The deceased personnel, according to a source, were ambushed by the bandits near Gora-Namaye village, where they opened fire on them. A spokesperson for the state police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, said the ambush followed the killing of an unspecified number of bandits, who blocked the Bakur-Gusau road last Sunday. Shehu said, “Yes they ambushed our troops, killing four policemen, one civil defence officer and another was critically injured.” He added that the command pursued the bandits in the forest, where they recovered six rifles after a gun battle that lasted several hours.
