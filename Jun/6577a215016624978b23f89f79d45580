The Ekiti State Government has denied reports that some military men went on the rampage around the gates of the Governor’s Office and Government House, Ado Ekiti, the state capital. There was tension on Tuesday following the presence of the military men, who were alleged to be protesting over certain issues. But the state Commissioner for Information, Akin Omole, said the soldiers were on a visit to the governor. Omole, in a statement, titled, ‘Alleged soldiers’ demonstration’, clarified that the military men were “new recruits into the Nigerian Army, who are indigenes of Ekiti State.” He said, “They (the new recruits of Ekiti origin) came together to pay a courtesy call on Dr Kayode Fayemi, Governor of Ekiti State. The unscheduled visit, however, met Mr Governor’s absence, and they were advised to properly channel their request for a meeting so that they could engage with Mr Governor on a later date, after which they dispersed. “The large number of security operatives around the Governor’s Office and the Fajuyi area of the state capital, Ado Ekiti, understandably attracted considerable attention. Accordingly, we would like to use this opportunity to assure the public that there is no cause for alarm. “The Government of Ekiti State continues to work collaboratively with federal security agencies and their personnel to advance peace and security in the state and the entire country,” he said.
