RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has received a formal letter of approval from the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, for the establishment of a Nigerian Law School campus in Port Harcourt. The letter was presented to Wike by the Director General of the Nigerian Law School, Prof. Isa Chiroma, at the Government House, Port Harcourt on Thursday. Wike said it was gratifying that the Council of Legal Education and the Attorney General of the Federation had “graciously” given approval to the state government to assist in the establishment of a Law School in Port Harcourt, an offer which was initially rejected by the immediate past administration in the state. The governor commended Malami, SAN, for his statesmanship and commitment to the growth of legal education in Nigeria. He said, “This is devoid of any political affiliation. I must commend him for this show of sportsmanship, for this show of leadership; that at the end of the day, it is Nigerians and Rivers people that will benefit from the establishment of this campus in Port Harcourt.” Wike explained that construction work had already commenced at the site approved by the state government for the Port Harcourt campus of the Nigerian Law School. According to him, the campus will be ready in the next six months and the Certificate of Occupancy for the school is ready. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
