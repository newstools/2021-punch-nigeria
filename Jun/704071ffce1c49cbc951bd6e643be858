Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has said his government is ready to assent to a bill seeking to make compulsory the payment of fees for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination and the National Examination Council by the state government for students in public schools. This followed a revelation by the Speaker of the Adamawa State House of Assembly that lawmakers were considering giving legislative backing to the compulsory payment of WASSCE and NECO examination fees by the state government for students in public schools. The Director Media and Communications, Government House, Yola, Solomon Kumangar, while reacting to an inquiry by The PUNCH on Tuesday, said Fintiri would welcome the idea. He said, “It is a good thing because it is a bill that will entrench the payment of WASSCE and NECO fees and make it mandatory for the state government to do. The governor will welcome it and assent to it.” Kumangar noted that education remained the governor’s priority. He said since assuming office in 2019, Fintiri resumed picking up the bill for students sitting WASSCE and NECO exams, as well as bursary scholarship for students of tertiary institutions studying within the country and overseas.
