Health experts have raised the alarm that some farmers are using hormones, steroids and a lot of antibiotics in rearing chicken and fish. This practice, they say, is inimical to public health, warning that it may cause serious health problems like allergies and asthma in children. According to the experts, hormones such as steroidal (oestrogens, gestagens, and androgens), nonsteroidal, semisynthetic, and synthetic or designer drugs are all growth-promoting and body-partitioning agents. They stated that some farm-owners use these chemicals to improve body weight gain and increase feed conversion efficiency, stressing that this is wrong. According to them, the use of these hormones and hormonal growth-promoting agents eventually ends up with the occurrence of residues in animal food. They cautioned that the incidence of hormone residues in such types of food and food products is a risk factor for the occurrence of public health problems. Speaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, a Professor of Radiation Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Ifeoma Okoye, says the government should look into what Nigerians are eating by checking the nationâ€™s food production process. Okoye said this is because a lot of Nigerians are injecting poisons into their body by what they eat, owing to sharp practices in the food production chain. According to her, some farmers are putting hormones and steroids in the feeds that they give to their chicken and fishes for them to grow larger and faster, without considering the health implications on the consuming public.
