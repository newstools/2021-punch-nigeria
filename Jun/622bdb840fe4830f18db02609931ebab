Swift Telephone Network has said it can add three million new subscribers to the nation’s subscriber base under the right regulatory framework. The Managing Director, Wole Adetuyi, said this during an interview with our correspondent in Lagos. He said, “With the right regulatory framework, STN will raise new three million subscribers in 12 to 24 months. We have the understanding of how to push for that.” The managing director disclosed that STN started as a pay-phone service centre in the University of Lagos in the late ‘90s, before it launched the first pager service in Unilag late in the early 2000s. The company later innovated the first scratch card payment system in Nigeria, that was implemented for West Africa Examination Council. After seven years of inactivity, the company relaunched in 2019 and now has over 500,000 customers that use its network. He also said its closed user group service that it planned to launch could help in the fight against insecurity in the nation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
