Some Nigerians in Canada and the United States of America, under the aegis of PTB4 Nigeria In Canada Group, will on Saturday host the Serving Overseer of The Citadel Global Community Church, formerly Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, in a conversation, tagged, ‘Democracy Day Dialogue.’ The online event will be live streamed on Zoom and Youtube from 7pm Nigerian time. The convener of the event, Adebayo Adejuwon, who is based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, told The PUNCH on Wednesday that the programme, themed, ‘Rethinking the Nigerian State,’ would address the challenges confronting the country. He said the group had hoped that the Nigerian leadership would confront issues of security, youth unemployment, and corruption — the three key electioneering promises of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). He lamented that rather, there had been heightened insecurity in form of kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, as well as ethnic clashes. “And above all, there has been open secessionist advocacy resulting from perceived injustice, inequality claims by various ethnic nationalities within the Nigerian space, which is threatening the corporate existence of the Nigerian state as a sovereign entity. “Our response as a group of non-state actors and patriots is that there is the urgent need to rethink the Nigerian state before it is too late,” he added. According to Adejuwon, the event will engage Nigerians from across the globe, especially those in diaspora, on how to become stakeholders and not spectators in the rebuilding of the country.
