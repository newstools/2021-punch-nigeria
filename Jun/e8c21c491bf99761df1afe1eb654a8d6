THE Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has struck out two suits challenging the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress. Delivering the ruling in the separate suits on Tuesday, Justice Taiwo Taiwo held that the plaintiffs lacked the locus standi to bring the suit against the party. In separate suits filed by the former South-South National Vice Chairman of the party, Hilliard Eta; and former APC Youth leader in Abia State, Kalu Agu, the plaintiffs had asked the court to determine the legality or otherwise of the June 17, 2020 National Executive Committee meeting which dissolved the NWC and appointed a National Caretaker Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai-Mala Buni. The defendant had raised a preliminary objection that the plaintiffs had not shown how the dissolution of the NWC had infringed on their civil rights and obligation more than any other member of the party. In its ruling on the preliminary objection, the court held that “it is sheer waste of time and there is no reason to consider the substantive matter.” According to the court, “There must be a nexus between a plaintiff and the cause of action.” The judge noted that the first plaintiff did not fit in properly into who a plaintiff is, while the second plaintiff, Hilliard Eta, “referred to himself as a regular member of the party.” The court stated that for the APC to be a plaintiff, there must be the existence of a faction. “In an affidavit deposed to by the second plaintiff, there was nowhere he claimed to belong to a faction, the court stated.” The judge subsequently struck out the name of APC as a defendant in the suit.
