THE Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has appealed to the Federal Government to assist his administration construct the Nembe-Brass road, in the Bayelsa East Senatorial District. The governor said the cost implication was too much for the state to bear. Diri, spoke during the weekly state executive council meeting in Government House, Yenagoa, on Wednesday. This was contained in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah. He stated that the importance of constructing the Bayelsa East senatorial road could not be over-emphasised because of its socio-economic importance. Diri was quoted as saying, “The Federal Government out of Presidential Executive Order 7 is constructing a road alongside some private companies in the case of the Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas project in Rivers State. “The Federal Government is also doing the same in the western axis in Lagos and other areas. So, we are appealing to the Federal Government to extend the same gesture to us. “As a government, we are prepared to also bring in whatever is our deal into the project. So, on your behalf, I went to Abuja to meet with very senior officials of the Federal Government and I can report to you that they received us very well. If all our requests are granted, from next year we can kickstart the Brass Road project. “I want to use the opportunity to call on all well-meaning Bayelsans from all walks of life to support this noble idea by this government, particularly those who are representing us at the federal level. Please speak on behalf of the people of your state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
