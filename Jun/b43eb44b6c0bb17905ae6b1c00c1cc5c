Bandits on Thursday night invaded Kore in Dambatta Local Government Area of Kano State and abducted a businessman of Igbo extraction identified as Emmanuel Eze, who had been residing in the LGA for over seven years. Following the development, the state Commissioner of Police, Sama’ila Dikko promptly dispatched a squad of crack detectives to comb the vicinity and apprehend the fleeing bandits who struck the town at about 10.30pm on Thursday. According to an eyewitness account, the bandits who arrived in the town in large numbers were said to have shot sporadically into the air before whisking away their victim, adding that a young man was injured in the ear by a stray bullet. As at the time of filing this report, the bandits were yet to establish contact with the family of the victim even as police are currently combing the area to apprehend them and rescue the victim. The Kano Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, confirmed the incident on Friday to newsmen. According to him, “Bandits kidnapped Emmanuel Eze in his Provision Store at Kore in Danbatta Local Government Area of Kano State,” adding that “a team of Police officers have been mobilised to rescue and arrest the fleeing culprits.” The PUNCH earlier reported that the Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, on Thursday, visited security formations’ headquarters in Abuja, raising serious concern that bandits are gradually infiltrating Kano forests.
