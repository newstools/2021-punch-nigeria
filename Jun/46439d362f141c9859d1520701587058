The Academic Staff Union of Universities, Yobe State University Branch, has commenced a two-week warning strike over the non-implementation of agreements earlier reached between the union and the state government. The ASUU Chairperson of the university, Mohammed Jajere, who confirmed the industrial action to our correspondent, said the national delegates of the union had arrived in the state to intervene in the matter. “A meeting is scheduled for later today (Tuesday) between the union’s leadership and government representatives in order to find a common ground,” he added. Some of the grievances, according to him, include the inability of the government to pay members the earned academic allowance for 2020, as well as research grants, among other issues. The union had issued a notice of strike in a letter signed by Jajere and addressed to the university’s vice chancellor on May 25, 2021. It read in part, “Sequel to the congress meeting held on 25th May, 2021, I wish to inform you that the congress has resolved and directed its members to embark on two weeks warning strike with effect from Tuesday 8th June, 2021, if its demands as contained in the earlier resolution dated 18th January 2021 and 18th February 2021, respectively, are not attended to.” The warning strike is coming when the university just concluded the second semester examination.
