The President, Major General  Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has claimed that last year’s #EndSARS protest against police brutality was aimed at removing him from office. Buhari said this when he appeared on Arise TV on Thursday morning. The president stated that those who participated in the protest have made Nigeria unattractive to investors. He also blamed the protest on the dwindling inflow of foreign direct investment to the country. He was asked how he could improve foreign direct investment in Nigeria. In response, he said, “This question was answered last year when there was the #EndSARS protest. You remember the young people that wanted to march here and remove me?” He added, “Tell the young people to behave themselves and make the country safe, then we can attract real investors to the country”.
