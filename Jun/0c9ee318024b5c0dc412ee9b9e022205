The Ambassador of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Jon Chol, has expressed the desire for the government of North Korea to enjoy closer ties with the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government. Chol spoke through an interpreter at a meeting with the National Secretary of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, who stood in for the APC National Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni, in Abuja, on Tuesday. He said, “Our two countries have long-standing relations of friendship and cooperation. The leaders of the two countries and their people rejoice with the creative achievements which both countries are making. “The DPRK government prioritises developing bilateral ties with the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” The diplomat said the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea was impressed with the achievements of the APC and Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under Buni’s leadership. Buni, who was represented at the event by Akpanudoedehe, said, ‘The APC is the ruling party in Nigeria and is the largest political party in Africa going by figures of its just-concluded membership registration. We stand at over 40 million registered members. ‘The bilateral relationship between Nigeria and DPRK goes as far back as 1976, and in recent times, our two countries have collaborated in the area of education and technological development. “Our two political parties and our two countries can do a lot more together.”
