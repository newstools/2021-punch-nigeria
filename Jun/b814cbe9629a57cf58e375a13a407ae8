The Lagos State Government has called on the state Cooperative College to develop a policy to make cooperative movement in the state a source of financial aid to keep the populace employed. The Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Dr Lola Akande, stated this during a three-day strategic meeting, organised by members of the Lagos State College Governing Council and management team, a statement said on Monday. She said, “This meeting presents a perfect opportunity to set the roadmap for the development of a policy for the cooperative movement which has been one major financial haven for the informal sector and an integral part of the state’s economy that keeps a significant number of the populace in employment. “The Lagos State Government, in developing and fortifying the sector, has presented before the state House of Assembly, a bill that will address all forms of sharp practices when passed into law. “The cooperative movement possesses the potential for more economic sustenance if well developed and better managed and it is the aim of this government to harness the potential in the movement to create employment, eradicate poverty and boost socio-economic growth.” Copyright PUNCH.
