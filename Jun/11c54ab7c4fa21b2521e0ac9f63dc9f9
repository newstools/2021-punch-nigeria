About eight lives were lost and 33 worship centres burnt during the crisis in the Billiri area of Gombe, The PUNCH has learnt. The Billiri crisis of March 19 2021 was caused by a delay in the announcement of a Mai Tangle, the paramount ruler of the area. The state Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, later formed a committee of inquiry to evaluate the destruction caused by the crisis. Presenting the committee’s findings on Tuesday to Yahaya at the Exco Chamber of the Government House, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Ethical Orientation, Adamu Kupto, said the committee embarked on an assessment tour to the affected areas seven times. Kupto, who is also the committee chairman, refused to mention the estimated sum his team recommended for compensation. He said, “About eight lives were lost. In the course of the assessment, we realised that about 41 houses were affected. Out of the 401 business premises affected, 335 belongs to an individual, while 66 belongs to the local government. “Thirty-three worship centres, 32 mosques and a church were affected. There were also motor vehicles, goats and other valuables bearing various degrees of damage. “After due diligence, we were able to assess the extent of damage. Most are contained in the report that we are going to submit now. Also, there were recommendations,” he added. Yahaya said his administration meant well, adding that justice would be done. According to him, the reason for the formation of the committee was to entrench healing and brotherhood. ”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
