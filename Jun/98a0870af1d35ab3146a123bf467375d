The Niger State Police Command has described as untrue claims that the Registrar of the National Examination Council, Prof. Godswill Onion, was assassinated by gunmen in Minna, Niger State. The organisation said his family had formally announced that he passed on after a brief illness at the National Hospital Abuja. A spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command, Wasiu Abiodun, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, made the clarification in a statement with Ref. No: AZ:5250/NGS/PPRO/VOL.20/117 which he sent to The PUNCH in Abuja on Tuesday. He said, “It is important to state categorically that on May 31, 2021, the family of the Registrar/CEO, National Examinations Council, Prof. Godswill Obioma, formally announced that he passed to eternal glory after a brief illness at the National Hospital Abuja. “Members of the public are hereby urged to disregard the fake news and news reporters are advised to always verify their report before publication to avoid creating unnecessary panic and fear in the public domain.” ”Copyright PUNCH.
