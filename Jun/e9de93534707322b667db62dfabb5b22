A 45-year-old prophetess, Augusta Olozulu, has been remanded in a correctional centre in Ogwash-Uku, Delta State, for alleged conspiracy, cyber stalking and murder of one Thomas Emomitimi. Emomitimi was allegedly murdered on April 18, 2021, at Ughelli by heavily armed men over a church dispute. The victim was said to be returning from a friend’s house when gunmen, who had laid an ambush for him, suddenly emerged and engaged him in a heated argument before he was shot dead and the killers escaped from the scene. Following an ex parte motion filed by the Zone 5 Police Headquarters, Benin City, the Asaba Magistrates’ Court remanded Olozulu of the Christ World Deliverance Church, Maccoba, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, in the correctional centre. The command said it had launched a manhunt for others involved in the killing of Emomitimi. It explained that the fleeing suspects’ bank accounts, where huge sums of money were allegedly transferred to by the prophetess, were detected during investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
