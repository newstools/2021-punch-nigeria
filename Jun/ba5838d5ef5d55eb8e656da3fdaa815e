A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State, Adeola Sosanwo, has endorsed the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, to contest the forthcoming elections, following his performance so far. Sosanwo, who is the Chairman of SAS Foundation, also urged Abiodun to expedite the ongoing infrastructural projects across the state. He made this known while celebrating what he termed ‘two years’ purposeful leadership’ of the governor, which according to him, is already a good basis to allow him to continue his good works in office. Sosanwo, in a statement said, “In the last two years, every part of Ogun State has been the object of his focus for development. The education sector, with the rehabilitation and construction of over 700 classrooms, is there for all to see. What of the massive upgrading of all our primary health care centres and other health facilities owned by the state! “The governor has demonstrated so much committed interest in infrastructure. Ogun is now a massive construction site and the road projects we are talking about here have a direct impact on the lives of people of the state.” He also thanked the governor for improving agriculture and housing, saying he had done much “wonders” in the sectors such that many youths, through the Central Bank of Nigeria-backed Anchor Borrowers Programme, had been taken off the street. “I strongly believe that Governor Abiodun has so far justified the confidence reposed in him and he is certainly good for another term of four years,” he concluded Copyright PUNCH.
