The Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, has charged the newly sworn-in Court of Appeal Justices to discharge their duties with utmost sincerity and honesty. The CJN stated this at the swearing-in of the 18 justices at the Supreme Court on Monday. “The onus is on you to fasten your belt and roll up your sleeves to face the challenges head-on. You must redouble your pace to catch up with the expectations of the litigants. “As judicial officers, you have a divine mandate on earth that you must discharge with unveiled honesty and sincerity. You must give good account of yourselves to justify your elevation to the Court of Appeal,” he said. He also warned the new Justices on the dangers of gifts and wealth that they did not work for. He said, “Many high-profile cases would definitely come to you on appeal; and they may likely come in company with some juicy, irresistible temptations, but I am making it clear to you now that you must flee from such disguised danger.” A former Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, called for the appointment of more justices, saying there was a need for increased manpower. He said, “I personally believe that we need more justices in all the courts; in all the appellate courts, the Court of Appeal and even the Supreme Court. Also, more judges in all the high courts in this country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
