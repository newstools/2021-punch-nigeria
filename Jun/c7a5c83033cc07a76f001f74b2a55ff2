A music executive, Precious Okonkwo, aka Precious P Money, has said that he finds joy in grooming budding talents. P Money, who recently set up a recording studio, said, “I established the studio so that promising talents can record music that would be of international standards. I have always loved to encourage artistes and provide avenues for them to excel in their chosen careers. “The studio is also meant to bridge the gap between established artistes and the ones that are just coming up. It will also create a level playing ground, where they can share ideas in music.” P Money, who doubles as a producer and software engineer, noted that the next superstar could come from anywhere. He added, “I don’t look down on anybody because even the biggest artistes today started from somewhere. Once an artiste is talented, I am ready to work with such person.” Copyright PUNCH.
