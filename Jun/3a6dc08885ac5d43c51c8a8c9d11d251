THE management of a private institution in Abuja, Veritas University, has decided to introduce online learning following concerns raised by parents over security of students. The university located in Bwari axis of Abuja is owned by the Catholic Church. Recall that some schools shut down recently in Abuja over reports that some bandits operating in Niger State, including abducting students from schools, were sighted in some communities near the Federal Capital Territory. Although the university was on mid-semester break as of the time, it had earlier postponed resumption indefinitely because of insecurity. But our correspondent learnt on Wednesday that its management had decided to offer the online learning option to students whose parents were still raising fears over their safety on campus. A parent, who did not want her name in print, told The PUNCH that the school authority had already issued a circular announcing the decision to offer online learning. Our correspondent sighted the latest circular signed by the university’s Registrar, Dr Stella Chizoba, asking parents to decide whether their children would resume physically or virtually. Part of the circular read, “In recognition of this fact, therefore, and after due consultations, Veritas University Management has decided that the rest of the second semester of the 2021 session will be blended. That implies that lectures will be held both online and physically within the campus. “In consequence, therefore, students and their parents/sponsors are free to decide whether to resume physically onsite in the university or to continue their lectures online.” Copyright PUNCH.
