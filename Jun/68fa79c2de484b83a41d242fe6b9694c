The result of the All Progressives Congress local government primaries for councillors and chairmen, which was conducted on Saturday, has yet to be released. As of Monday, the APC secretariat along Acme Road, Ikeja, was barricaded by policemen and soldiers and no vehicular or individual movement were permitted. The security official at the gate did not allow any journalists inside the secretariat, saying, “No media is allowed in.” The spokesperson for the party, Mr Seye Oladejo, did not pick his phone when our correspondent called him on Monday. However, a source disclosed that the results from many of the local government areas in the state, such as Alimosho, Ojokoro and Ijede had been declared inconclusive, hence the delay. A chairmanship aspirant for the Ijede Local Council Development Area in Ikorodu, Lagos State, Mr Oluwatosin Onamade, who visited the secretariat, said the election only held in one ward out of four in his council. He said, “They came on Saturday for the election, and the election was conducted in my ward. But we have four wards in the LCDA. In the other three wards, there was no election.” “On that particular day, there was a name of a new person. This person didn’t purchase a form; she didn’t do any screening, she was not involved in any of the process. “I am not happy with the whole thing, but I believe that the leadership of the APC will do something about it.” Copyright PUNCH.
