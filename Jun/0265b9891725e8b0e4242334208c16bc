THE South West Zone of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Monday, appealed to the people of Oyo State to support the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde, to enable it to deliver on his vision for the state. PDP Zonal Publicity Secretary, Chief Sanya Atofarati, made the appeal in a statement titled, ‘You have made us proud’ – S’West PDP celebrates Makinde’s two years in office,’ in Ibadan, on Monday. Atofarati said, “The governor has performed extremely well surpassing the people’s expectations in just two years. We are very proud of Governor Seyi Makinde’s awesome achievements in the Pacesetter State since assuming office on May 29, 2019. “Indeed, Governor Makinde has proved the critics wrong by hitting the ground running from the blast of the whistle on May 29, 2019 giving the dividends of democracy to the people of Oyo State in a manner that was unsurpassable in the annals of the history of the state.” The PDP thanked Makinde for embarking on a ‘silent revolution,’ adding that the governor’s slogan of lifting the people from poverty to prosperity is gradually working magic from workers’ welfare to educational development, primary health care delivery, to gargantuan leap in infrastructure face lift, among others. The statement further read, “We are therefore appealing to the good people of Oyo State to join hands with this exemplary leader, shun any divisive tendencies or distraction so that the dream of Governor Makinde to take Oyo State to the next level is realized.” Copyright PUNCH.
