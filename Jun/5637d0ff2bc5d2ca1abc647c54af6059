AXA Mansard Insurance Plc, a member of the AXA Group and global insurance and asset management organisation, says it has launched a new mobile application, called ‘MyAXA Plus’, that will enhance speedy service delivery to customers across Nigeria and beyond. It said in a statement on Saturday that the new launch followed the company’s first mobile app in 2017 which underscored its desire to deliver delightful and relevant, cutting-edge financial solutions to its customers and the larger society. It said, “MyAXA Plus has been very well received because it provides a much-improved, seamless, and satisfying experience that puts users at the heart of every feature and action on the app such as to make claims on their insurance policies, enabling fast reporting of incidents and payment of claims by the company. “Also, to book hospital visits, HMO customers of AXA Mansard can receive care at over 1,700 hospitals, and with MyAXA Plus, they can also pre-book hospital visits, reducing their wait time while also getting faster access to specialist consultations.” It said this would also allow customers to be able to renew their insurance policies by providing their car plate number on the app, adding that they could also renew their motor insurance policies within a few minutes.
