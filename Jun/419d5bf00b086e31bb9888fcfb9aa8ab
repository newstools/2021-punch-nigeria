The renovation of the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park began on Tuesday after the contractor, Bytrax Technologies Limited, took over the facility for the commencement of work. Speaking at the official handover of the facility to the contractor, the Chairman, Lagos State Sports Trust Fund, Femi Pedro, said the facility would be upgraded to international standard, with the renovation expected to last for six months. Pedro, in company with some board members and secretary of LSSTF, Olaposi Agunbiade, performed the handing-over ceremony, while the renovation would be supervised by the Lagos State Ministry of Works. “I think this is one of our major works as a board and this is also in line with the agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, which is youth empowerment through sports. We believe upgrading this facility to international standards will attract more international competitions to the state, while our athletes will also use it to train, in readiness for major competitions. The renovation work has commenced officially from today (yesterday) and this is the first phase of the work, while the second phase takes off at the expiration of the first phase. “This project will not be possible without the support of the state government, Lagos Lottery Board, and Chief Kensington Adebutu, who has been supporting us. We are hoping that some major corporate bodies in the state would also come on board to support us to upgrade and build sporting facilities across the state,” the former Lagos State Deputy Governor added.
