The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said it had commenced investigation into alleged conspiracy, computer-related fraud, obtaining by false pretences and retention of proceeds of unlawful activities levelled against one Malik Bakare. A statement by the anti-graft agency’s Head, Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, said Malik was arrested by officers of the Nigeria Police Force, Criminal Investigation Department, Alagbon, Lagos, on May 31, 2021, and handed over to the EFCC for further investigation and prosecution. The statement read in part, “Investigation revealed that he acts as a middleman, who connects Internet fraudsters around the globe with pickers, and receives some percentage on every successful transaction from the proceeds of unlawful activities.” The suspect’s father was also arrested when he came forward to claim ownership of a Range Rover SUV that was retrieved from his son without a proof of ownership. “During investigation, his father, Isa Bakare, appeared at the commission, claiming ownership of a Range Rover SUV estimated at about N46m, which was recovered from his son. He, however, could not give a satisfactory account of how he was able to procure the vehicle.” The statement added that the suspects would soon be charged. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
