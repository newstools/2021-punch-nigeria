The Lagos State Waste Management Authority has announced the signing of a five-year agreement with the state’s PSP operators to enhance their operational activities and reassure them of the government’s commitment to their sustainability. In a statement, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of LAWMA, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, said the state was entering a new phase of waste collection and disposal and would strengthen the sector and make it wholly manageable. He enjoined the PSP operators to improve on their service delivery and in good faith repay the magnanimity of the state governor by ensuring that they discharge their duties diligently. He warned against the indiscriminate dumping of refuse, stressing that the agency would strictly enforce sanitary best practices to curb such activities. Odumboni said, “The idea of people dumping waste indiscriminately into drainages, water channels, the median and other unauthorised places must stop as it would be seriously frowned upon and offenders prosecuted. “We will have such houses sealed and make defaulters to face the law.” He appealed to Lagosians to pay their waste bills promptly as the government would not take kindly to non-payment of bills. The President, Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria, Mr David Oriyomi, assured the authority of the association’s total commitment to ensuring a sustainably cleaner Lagos and its environs, pledging their total support to the state government.
