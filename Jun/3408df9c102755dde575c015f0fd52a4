The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said his involvement in politics was meant to help drive the process of change in Edo politics. Obaseki said this at an event in Benin on Thursday. He said the last seven months of his second term had been spent separating governance from politics all in a bid to positively improve the system to make it work better for citizens. He said, “In the last seven months, in trying to reform the system, we discovered that the government lacked professionals in the civil service to set the machinery of government on motion before political appointees will step in to collaborate in making Edo great again. “I am into politics in the state to midwife the process of change, as change is a constant thing in life. We can’t do politics the way that we did it in 1999. “Nigeria is changing. Therefore, the politics of Edo State must change, the narrative must change. It’s not a mistake going through all the processes that we went through, from campaign to election and court cases; God allowed it for a reason.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
