The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has charged banks operating across the country to adopt strict mechanisms in order to regulate and monitor activities of Mobile Money/Point of Sale Operators. Babashani Sanda, Head of the Gombe Zonal Office, gave the charge on Thursday while receiving the Controller of Central Bank of Nigeria in Gombe State, Alhaji Shehu Goringor, and his team in Gombe. “I am quite pleased to have you here having noted the existing cordial relationship between the EFCC and CBN, especially in the area of exchange of information and the need to further strengthen it for our mutual benefit and that of Nigeria as a whole. “This visit is timely as it gives me the opportunity to report to you an emerging trend involving Mobile Money Operators, commonly called POS Operators, in abetting crimes, especially cybercrimes,” Sanda said. Goringor had earlier stated that they intend to solidify the already existing relationship between the two organisations and to equally solicit EFCC’s assistance in the areas of training and sensitisation.
