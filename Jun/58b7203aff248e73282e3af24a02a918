That is, N2.4bn was generated in 2019 against N5.08bn in 2020.” The Group Managing Director, Tope Smart, speaking on the company’s efforts on the industry’s recapitalisation, said, “Insurance companies were required to meet up with 50 per cent of their required capital by 31st December, 2020 while full compliance was scheduled to be attained by 30th September, 2021. “We met the first phase by capitalising our share premium and part of our retained earnings to bring our paid-up capital to N5,016,477,000. “This was achieved through the issuance of bonus shares to all existing shareholders as at middle of December. Suffice to say that the recapitalisation exercise has now been suspended as a result of court injunction.” He said a review of its performance showed that all its performance indices came out positive during the period under review.
