Nigeria wrestlers will travel to Poland for the Poland Open Ranking Series in preparation for the 2020 Olympics Games. Four Nigerian female wrestlers: Odunayo Adekuoroye, Blessing Oborududu, Aminat Adeniyi and youngster Adijat Idris have already qualified for the Tokyo Games. Speaking with our correspondent from their training camp in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, team coach Purity Akuh said they would use the Poland tournament to wrap up their preparations before they head to Tokyo for the Olympics. “We are preparing for the Poland Ranking Series, which starts on June 8 and ends June 13. We are in Yenagoa for three weeks, we are in the final phase now before we travel to Poland,” Akuh told The PUNCH. “It will be a test for us, especially in the technical angle, for us to see what is remaining and what we need to do before flying down to Tokyo. It is a very good tournament for us, our athletes are in good shape, they are ready and we are hoping and praying that by God’s grace, they will do well in the competition.” Akuh said with the level of preparations, he is assured of a podium finish at the Olympics. “I cannot mention the colour of medals we are going to win at the Olympics, but I know we are going to be on the podium. We have worked over the years, we have planned over the years, and this is time for us to achieve our goal. I know we are going to be on the podium, I’m very optimistic,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
