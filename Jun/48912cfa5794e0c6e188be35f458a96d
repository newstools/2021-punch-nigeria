Middlesbrough have announced the signing of former Nigeria U-20 international Sammy Ameobi. Ameobi’s signing was announced on the club’s website on Tuesday. “The club is delighted to confirm that Sammy Ameobi is our second signing of the summer. The 29-year-old has agreed terms to join Boro after undergoing a medical at Rockliffe,” Middlesbrough said in a statement. “As soon as I became aware Sammy was available I let him know I wanted him, and we had a few good conversations. I thought it was important he could see what he could do for us, and what I could do for him. “I’ve always thought he’s a danger, and I’ll be looking to use that danger and have a system where I can get him in positive forward positions,” the club’s website quoted Middlesbrough coach Neil Warnock. The move represents a return to the club for Ameobi after a loan spell here back in 2013. The Newcastle-born winger, who becomes Boro’s second signing of the summer after Joe Lumley from QPR, joins on a two-year contract with the option of a further year.
