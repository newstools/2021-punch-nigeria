THE Ebonyi State Commissioner for Infrastructure Concession and Development, Fidelis Nweze, is dead. Nweze, a two-time commissioner in the state, was on his way to Enugu on Saturday in company of his driver when the car in which they were travelling rammed into a stationary vehicle at the busy Eke Obinagu axis of Enugu North Local Government Area at about 7.30pm. While it was gathered that his driver had been unconscious as of the time of filing this report, the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Tuesday evening said Nweze died on Tuesday morning at the Intensive Care Unit of the Turkish Hospital, Abuja, where efforts by medical experts had been in top gear to save his life. Meanwhile, following the death of the commissioner, Umahi declared Wednesday (today) public holidays across the state. He ordered civil servants to stay at home while markets, banks, and all public places should remain closed. According to Umahi, the Nigerian flag should be lowered in the state in honour of his aide.
