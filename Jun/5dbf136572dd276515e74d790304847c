The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, on Wednesday, charged officers and men of the Nigeria Police to exhibit high sense of professionalism, obey human rights and shun all forms of abuse of the law. While addressing officers and men of the command at its headquarters in Bompai, Kano, Baba described Kano as one of the strategic commands in the country given its high population and commercial activities. The IG said the police under his stewardship were working tirelessly towards ensuring that all needed ammunition were provided to police formations nationwide. “I am using this avenue to call on Divisional Police Officers to organise lectures and training regularly for officers and men working under their formations, which would boost their morale and dedication. “We are working towards ensuring that all rank and file personnel of the Nigerian police are being supplied with uniforms free of charge; but you should take note that you have to make sacrifices to improve your job and improve yourself,” he added. Earlier, the Kano State Commissioner of Police, Sama’ila Dikko, disclosed that the command had over 7,000 personnel who provided security to over 15 million people. Dikko, however, lamented the inadequacy of operational vehicles and manpower, pointing out that the command required additional arms and ammunition to tackle numerous challenges. Copyright PUNCH.
