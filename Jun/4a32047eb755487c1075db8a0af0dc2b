The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday, said his administration has not performed badly. Buhari said this during an exclusive interview with the Nigerian Television Authority which was monitored by The PUNCH. The President was asked how he would describe the country today and he said, “Well,  I want Nigerians to be fair to this administration. “They should reflect seriously on the time we came in especially as far as the North East and the South-South are concerned. “Where we are now in terms of resources – how much we are producing… The previous administration before me was producing  2.1 million per day at 100 American dollars per barrel. “When we came in, militants in the South-South were unleashed on this administration and production went down to half a million barrels per day and then oil price collapsed in the market. “I will like Nigerians to reflect on these in terms of resources…and I believe that we have not done very badly.”
