Some men suspected to be bandits, on Wednesday, attacked the home of a farmer, simply identified as Dele, in Ajowa Akoko, Akoko North-West Local Government Area of Ondo State, kidnapped his two sons and killed two of his other children. It was gathered that the bandits had gone to the residence of a cattle herder in the community, Yinka Oludotun, in the early hours of the day and were shooting indiscriminately, but could not gain entry. A source said it was the timely intervention of the men of the Nigerian Army that foiled the attack as the soldiers chased the hoodlums away from the area. “It was after the bandits could not succeed in kidnapping Yinka that they left for the house of Dele to kill his two sons and kidnap his other two children to an unknown destination,” the source said. The source added that soldiers, policemen and men of the state Amotekun Corps were already combing the Ajowa Akoko forest to apprehend the criminals. When contacted, the state police spokesman, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident and said security agents were already on the trail of the bandits. “Yes, there was a kidnap incident at Ajowa and we are on the trail of the evil men. Meanwhile, investigation is ongoing,” the PPRO stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
