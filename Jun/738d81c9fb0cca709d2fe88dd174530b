A professor of Animal Nutrition at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Prof. Adeyemi Bamgbose, has urged the Federal Government to review the agricultural policies in the country to avert famine. Bamgbose said this during the 65th inaugural lecture of the university on Wednesday with the theme, ‘Feeds and Feedstuffs: Panacea for Declining Commercial Animal Agriculture and Food Insecurity in Nigeria.’ The lecturer lamented the rising cost of living in the country, saying inflation had hit a four-year high by more than 18 per cent in March. He said there was the need to harness the available unconventional feed resources localised in different eco-systems and regions in Nigeria. He said the utilisation of some important unconventional feedstuffs through improved feeding regimes and the management practices could be used to improve the productivity of animals which would stimulate human productivity, engender development and increase gross domestic product. “By doing so, Nigeria will join the league of advanced countries in the world in no distant future,” Bamgbose said.
