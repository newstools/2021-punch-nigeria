Two days after he was abducted by unknown gunmen, the technical manager of Rivets United Football Club, Stanley Eguma, has regained his freedom. The General Manager of the football club, Chief Okey Kpalukwu, confirmed his release to our correspondent in Port Harcourt on Friday morning. Recall that Eguma was abducted on Wednesday along the Enugu Road with two of his personal assistants on his way back from a Nigerian Professional Football League game against Adamawa United, played at the Ribadu Square Stadium, Yola, which the Port Harcourt-based side lost 2-0. Kpalukwu in a short message said that the Rivers United Club handler has breathed the air of freedom. He said,” We’re grateful to God for His mercy. “Our Technical Manager Stanley Eguma has been released by his abductors. Our God is gracious.” He neither stated where nor how Eguma was freed. Also, he did not state if any ransom was paid to those who held him captive.
