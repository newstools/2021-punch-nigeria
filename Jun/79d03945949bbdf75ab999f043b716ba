Workers in Ondo State Civil Service, on Saturday, called on the state government to pay their full salaries, saying they would no longer accept part salary payment. The government was said to have been paying salaries of the workers in the state in percentages, for the past few months. The State Executive and Administrative Councils of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, Ondo State Chapter, at the end of its emergency meeting on Saturday, resolved that the workers would no longer accept partial salaries because of the high prices of essential commodities. This was contained in a communiqué issued after the meeting held in Akure, the state capital. The labour union empathised with workers on the current economic situation in the country, especially the astronomical increase in the prices of food and other essential items. The TUC, commending the Ondo State Health Insurance Scheme, however, called on “the state government not to commence its implementation until all issues surrounding it like amount deductible and coverage areas of the scheme, and until arrears of salaries are fully paid and government resumes 100 per cent salary payment.” Copyright PUNCH.
