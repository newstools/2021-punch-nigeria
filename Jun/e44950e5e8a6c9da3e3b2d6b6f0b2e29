The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, has said the state has lost 14 health workers to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Abayomi, in a statement on Sunday, added that the state government was not resting on its oars in the battle against COVID-19, adding that strategies were being implemented to prevent a third wave of the disease in the state. He was quoted to have said this while receiving a special recognition award by the Nigerian Healthcare Excellence Award in recognition of the government’s approach in the COVID-19 response and management. While the state government emerged as the Most Responsive COVID-19 State Government of the year at NHEA 2021, Prof. Akin Abayomi bagged the award for the Most Outstanding COVID-19 State Health Commissioner of the year. “During the battle against COVID-19; the wave one and the wave two; we lost some our colleagues, we lost 14 health professionals; 12 doctors and two nurses. So, just to remember that there are still people dying around the world from COVID-19. “We want to say that we appreciate all the work that has been done by the frontline workers and sacrifices that have been made; during COVID-19 some doctors and nurses and professionals never saw their family for four weeks; they were constantly on call working night and day trying to save lives,” Abayomi said. The Commissioner noted that the state government had a policy of not receiving any award for COVID-19 response, but added because efforts aimed at preventing and managing the global pandemic was still ongoing. He, however, said the state government received the NHEA award to acknowledge the bravery of all frontline workers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
