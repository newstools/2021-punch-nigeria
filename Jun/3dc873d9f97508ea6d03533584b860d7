The Rivers State Police Command has appealed to Governor Nyesom Wike not to lift the night time curfew imposed in the wake of attacks on security formations and operatives in the state. A spokesman for the police command, Nnamdi Omoni, made the appeal during an interview with journalists in Port Harcourt, the state capital. Omoni said the curfew helped the police and other security agencies respond timely to distress calls, adding that security threats had reduced in the state since the curfew was imposed over a fortnight ago. He said, “The curfew was imposed essentially to arrest the trend of attacks on police. Since it was imposed, that attack has ceased abruptly and we are leveraging it. I think the governor should still delay it (curfew) for sometime because it has been assisting us. “We are driving the criminals away from Rivers State. So, when their remnants have been rounded off, then it can be lifted. “The curfew imposed by the state government is still on. It has not been relaxed. The governor who made that order is the same person that will rescind it or relax it, as it were.” Omoni, a Superintendent of Police, urged members of the public to continue to observe the 8.30pm to 6am curfew and report suspicious movements within their neighbourhood to the police for prompt action.
