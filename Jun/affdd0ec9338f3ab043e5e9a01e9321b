Chief Operating Officer of the Nigeria National League, Emmanuel Adesanya, says the league body has transferred the case involving Remo Stars and Bendel Insurance in Ikenne to the Nigeria Football Federation, The PUNCH reports. Several Insurance players and officials sustained varying degrees of injuries after fans of Remo Stars invaded the pitch, attacked them following their goalless draw in Ikenne on Sunday, with the visitors jumping fences and running long distances to safety. Deputy Governor of Edo, Philip Shaibu, on Monday threatened to pull Insurance out of the NNL if the league body failed to adequately punish Remo Stars, calling for a five-year ban on Remo. Speaking with The PUNCH, Adesanya said the issue had been transferred to the NFF Disciplinary Committee. He said, “The issue between Remo Stars and Bendel Insurance has gone beyond NNL because Remo wrote a letter in respect of the match and Insurance protested officially, which means the matter has become a disciplinary case to be attended to by the NFF. “Before we could take any decision the following day, Insurance had protested and Remo had written a letter defending themselves, which took the case beyond NNL. And I know the NFF Disciplinary Committee will look into the case before taking any decision.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
