The National Association of Polytechnic Students on Friday condemned the attack on Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic, Zaria, Kaduna State by suspected bandits. Reacting to the latest abduction, the association gave the Kaduna State government a seven-day ultimatum to secure the release of the staff and students. NAPS, in a communiqué signed by its President, Olalere Benedict, described the attacks on educational institutions as becoming unbearable. The communiqué reads, “After extensive deliberation and robust review of the state of NAPS both present and past, including the state of the polytechnic sector generally, the following resolution were reached. “We are worried and dissatisfied with incessant kidnapping of students, especially from polytechnics and monotechnics nationwide. We condemn the attack on Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic, Zaria, by bandits who abducted a yet-to-be ascertained number of students and staff over the night. “We call on government at all levels to intensify efforts in securing our campuses nationwide. The government of Kaduna State is hereby given seven days ultimatum to secure the release of our students from the hands of bandits.” NAPS also asked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to speedily assent to the HND/BSc Dichotomy Prohibition Bill recently passed by the Senate.
