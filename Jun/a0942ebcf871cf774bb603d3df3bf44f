Civil society organisation, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has vowed to sue the Federal Government of Nigeria, over its suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria. The PUNCH had earlier announced that the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension of Twitter activities on Friday via an official statement. The statement read, “The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.” However, checks by our correspondent showed that Twitter is still up in Nigeria as of the time of filing this report as users still have access to the platform. The minister’s statement was also silent on the time that the ban would be enforced. This suspension did not go down well with SERAP as it perceived the Twitter ban as a threat to human rights. In a statement released on Friday, SERAP wrote, “We’re suing Nigerian authorities over their illegal indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria. “Nigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way. Nigeria, we’ll see in court.”
