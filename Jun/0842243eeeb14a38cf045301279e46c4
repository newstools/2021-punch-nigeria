Super Eagles right back Tyronne Ebuehi is poised to undergo medicals ahead of a proposed loan move to newly promoted Italian Serie A club Venezia from Benfica, The PUNCH reports. The Nigeria international, according to Sky Italia, has arrived in Venice to complete the move, with Venezia holding an option to buy permanently. Ebuehi spent last season on loan at FC Twente from Portuguese giants Benfica, after recovering from a cruciate knee ligament that ruled him out of action for two years. Venezia secured promotion to the Serie A for the first time in 20 years. The Venice based club beat Cittadella 2-1 on aggregate in the playoff final. The 24-year-old Ebuehi played 34 times for the Reds last season, scoring once. Although the Eredivisie club were ready to take him on another loan deal, Benfica were only interested in a permanent sale. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
