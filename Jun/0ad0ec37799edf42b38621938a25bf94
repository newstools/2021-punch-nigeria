The Women in Energy Network has called for increased female inclusion and better adoption of technology in the oil and gas industry. While speaking on the theme ‘A female approach to the future of hydrocarbons” at the recent Nigeria International Petroleum Summit, the General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Nigeria LNG, Eyono Fatayi-Williams, canvassed for increased access to the industry for women, especially in the areas of local content and leadership. Williams, also the vice-president, gas, for WIEN, called on women to increase their participation by taking advantage of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010 and develop capacity in all ramifications. She was quoted as saying, “Let’s make this happen and tap into the organised framework to help women. We have strong and competent women leading in different parts of the industry. Women have what it takes.” WIEN’s Business Development and Publicity Director, Charlotte Essiet, while delivering her address during the session, urged industry participants not to be intimidated by the fast-paced nature of technology advancement in the industry but instead adopt technology to make their jobs easier and faster. Essiet, who is also AOS Orwell’s director of corporate and regulatory telations, added that there should be better integration of technology into operations, more education and training for workers.
