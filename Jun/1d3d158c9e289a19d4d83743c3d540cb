As part of activities marking Drowning Prevention Week, the Duchess of York, this week, read ‘Tobi Learns to Swim’ on her daily YouTube channel, Storytime With Fergie And Friends. The picture book for children was written by Nigerian author, Olubunmi Aboderin Talabi. The aim of Drowning Prevention Week campaign this year is to give individuals and families the skills and the knowledge they require to enjoy the water safely. During Drowning Prevention Week, schools, clubs and other organisations host events to promote and educate about water safety. With physical activities still limited across the globe at the moment, the Duchess contributed her quota towards assisting parents and guardians in helping children fall in love with swimming through her read aloud session featuring the book by Talabi. The Duchess, who was born Sarah Ferguson and nicknamed Fergie by the press, recently signed a publishing deal for seven children’s books. Her reading of Talabi’s ‘Tobi Learns to Swim’ has since garnered a lot of likes and created a buzz on social media, with many adult social media users praising the quality of Talabi’s picture book. Tobi Learns to Swim is a picture book that tells the story of 3-year old Tobi who gets a swimming costume for her 3rd birthday present and takes on the challenge of learning how to swim, figuring out how to float and conquering the fear of water. Talabi is the publisher of Clever Clogs Books and the convener of the Akada Children’s Book Festival. Talabi is “passionate about creating visually-engaging, culturally-relevant content for children, and has a desire to see steadily increasing literacy rates in her community.” On how people can get the book, Talabi shared that it is available online at cleverclogsbooks.com
