Houses, farm crops and other valuables, estimated at several millions of naira, have been destroyed by flood in Odoro Atasung village, in the Nsit-Ubium Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. It was gathered that the flood occurred in the early hours of Saturday, June 12, 2021, after a downpour in the community. It was learnt that the flood collapsed a mud house, overran several streets and destroyed farm crops, including maize and cassava. A resident, Mr Tommy Jackson, told our correspondent in Uyo on Wednesday that the community was in distress. He called on the state government to intervene and rescue residents from the menace of flooding, which he said had become a perennial problem. Jackson said, “The youth and members of Odoro Atasung community in the Nsit Ubium LGA are distressed with the ongoing flood. The downpour in the early morning of Saturday swallowed another mud house in the community and destroyed other houses and farm crops. “The youth, having waited in vain for a long period of time for the state government to come to their aid, decided to kick-start a community operation tagged, ‘Operation Flood Must Go in Our Community.’ “The operation is to dig a three-kilometre gutter to channel the flood in the community to the Okpoyo River,” he added. Another member of the community, Mr Emmanuel Ntuk, blamed the yearly flooding on the grading of the community road in 2015. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
