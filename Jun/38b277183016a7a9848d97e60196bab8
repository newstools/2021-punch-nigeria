Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, has celebrated a Nigerian ward host, identified as Gimba, for her dedication to patients at the Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone. A YouTube video released on Thursday played the recording of the phone call between Middleton and Gimba, where the Duchess praised the cook for her dedication. Gimba was one of the participants in Middleton’s Hold Still lockdown photography contest, where she sent a photograph of herself eating rice and chicken. Her image was one of 100 chosen for Middleton’s Hold Still photo contest and the Duchess had called Gimba to thank her for her participation. On the day she took the photograph, Gimba had received news that her mother in Nigeria had fallen ill, DailyMail reported. Despite being heartbroken as she was unable to fly back home due to COVID-19 restrictions, Gimba had refused to take the time off as she had said, “I have to feed my patients.” On that same day, she was photographed having her launch after she had prepared meals for all eighteen COVID-19 patients in the ward. During the call, the 39-year-old Duchess said, “I wanted to call to say thank you so much for sending in your wonderful photograph. It’s fantastic! You look like you’re seriously enjoying your chicken and rice, Gimba.” The Duchess of Cambridge then praised Gimba for her “total dedication to the patients”. Middleton pointed out that she was proud of Gimba who, though unable to visit her sick mother, could still dedicate her time to feeding other sick people at the hospital. The Duchess said, “It’s lovely to see the resilience and that glimmer of hope that you showed.”
