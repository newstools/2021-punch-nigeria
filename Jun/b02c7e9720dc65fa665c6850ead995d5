The Rotary District 9110, Nigeria, on Wednesday gave The PUNCH the Humanitarian Reporting Award 2021. The newspaper was announced the winner of the best newspaper in reportage of Rotary activities in District 9110. The club also gave awards to various media organisations and journalists in recognition of their publications. The Chairman of the planning committee, Sam Ayetutu, said the winners of the awards emerged through a critical election process. He said, “Our gathering tonight is to recognise and celebrate the key actors in the fourth estate of the realm who have and will continue to play a critical role in the quest of Rotary International to extend its objectives  in doing well around the world. “We are celebrating here today media organisations across the print, broadcast and online and other sectors of the media industry for their support for projecting the efforts of Rotarians who seamlessly contribute their time, talent and treasure to address many of the basic challenges facing our people.” Ayetutu further urged the awardees not to relent in their effort in giving more visibility to the Rotary Club.
