The Osun State Police Command, on Monday, said its personnel had arrested one Tosin Olarewaju after a gang of six men shot dead a suspected rival cult member in Osogbo. The deceased, who was killed on Sunday in the Sasa area of Osogbo, sources said emerged from the Ibokun Road area and was running, while the assailants chased after him. The sources added that the deceased was calling on people in the neighbourhood to help him as he was running away from his pursuers. It was gathered that the deceased was eventually caught by the assailants and shot at close range. The incident was the second killing by suspected rival cultists in the area in three days. The PUNCH had reported that a man, whose identity had not been ascertained, was shot by cultists, who also smashed his head with a big stone around Oja Oba in the capital city last Thursday. The command’s spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the latest killing, adding that 21-year-old Tosin Olarewaju had been arrested in connection with the crime. Opalola said, “Efforts are ongoing to arrest the fleeing suspects. It was reported that some young boys, about six on two motorcycles, chased one yet-to-be identified young boy. “He was said to be shouting: ‘Aiye are coming’ and was seen running along Ibokun Road around Sasa area. The boy was shot dead by the men suspected to be members of a rival group. “The assailants also picked a shot gun that dropped from the deceased and left the scene. Operatives visited the scene and took the corpse to the morgue of the UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Osogbo. “We have also apprehended one Olarewaju Tosin, 21. Efforts are on to arrest the fleeing suspects.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
