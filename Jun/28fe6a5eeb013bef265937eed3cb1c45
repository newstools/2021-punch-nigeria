Italy have asked UEFA for permission to replace Lorenzo Pellegrini with Fiorentina’s Gaetano Castrovilli in their Euro 2020 squad after the Roma midfielder picked up an injury, the Italian Football Federation said on Thursday. Pellegrini was struggling for fitness ahead of the tournament but earned a place in Roberto Mancini’s 26-man squad, only to suffer an injury in training on Wednesday. The news of Pellegrini’s injury comes less than 48 hours before Italy kick off Euro 2020 against Turkey. “The FIGC has submitted a request to UEFA surrounding the possibility of replacing Lorenzo Pellegrini, who, in training yesterday, picked up an injury,” read a FIGC statement. “He was taken for a scan this morning and will nonetheless remain part of the group, which will travel to Rome this morning. In anticipation of an answer from UEFA, Gaetano Castrovilli will join up with the group in Rome.” Italy welcome Turkey to Rome’s Stadio Olimpico for the opening game of the tournament on Friday. Mancini will be looking to get off the ground running during their opening game of the tournament and restore faith in Italian football after they failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Italy will also face Wales and Switzerland in Group A during the European Championship. However, they will have to do so without Roma midfielder, Pellegrini, thanks to his injury. The news of Pellegrini’s injury came just days after he was linked with a potential transfer to either Barcelona and Liverpool.
