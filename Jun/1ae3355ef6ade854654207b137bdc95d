The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), said he was prepared to lay down his life for Nigeria the day he joined the Nigerian Army. Buhari spoke on Saturday morning during his June 12 Democracy Day Broadcast. The ex-military leader, who joined the Army over 55 years ago, also restated his commitment to defending Nigeria’s corporate existence. He said, “As a nation, we have come very far from where we started and we are getting incrementally closer to where we ought to be. “Overcoming the present challenges is but one of a necessary process that we have to undergo as a nation so that we can come out stronger. The day I joined the Nigerian Army I was prepared to lay down my life for Nigeria. “As your President, I remain ever committed to upholding and defending Nigeria’s Corporate existence. “In adhering to the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy notably section 14(2)(b) I shall do all within my power to ensure that the Security and welfare of the people remain the primary purpose of government. “I have, throughout my tenure, provided the security agencies with all they require relative to available resources and will be providing more as the dynamics unfold to put an end to our security problems. “My strong belief in the Nigerian spirit gives me comfort that we are facing these challenges with renewed commitment to keep our country one.”
