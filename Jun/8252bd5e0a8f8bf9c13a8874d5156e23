The Ogun State government has said that it is set to introduce Information Communication and Technology based libraries with print, soft and internet facilities across the state, as part of efforts to restructure, remodify and reorganise all its libraries to improve its educational sector. In a statement on a Friday, the Director, Ogun State Library Board, Mr Giwa Franklin,  decried the neglect of public libraries in the nation. “Libraries have not only suffered long time neglect but also been poorly funded, inadequately staffed, lack modern equipment, and are not conducive for reading,” he said. Giwa said the innovation from the government would encourage accessibility to information, cheer e-community, promote paperless library, lead to the digitisation of books and bibliographies, and create soft links to about 100 computers system. He added that more than 7,250 materials were to be uploaded into the server for all readers across the state. While stressing the importance of the project, Giwa said, “The state has embarked on a complete restructuring and beautification of libraries in Ijebu-Ode and Simon Adebo in Abeokuta in accordance with global standard, while other libraries in Sagamu, Ikenne, Ilaro, and Ota would not be left out in the ongoing restructuring as work had been concluded to turn them around into befitting edifice.” According to Giwa, Ogun State had about 3,000 libraries in its public primary and secondary schools and the state planned to create a Gateway Readers’ Club across all its schools in the state. “The government has synergised with world bodies such as Book Aids for a renewed support in books supply and in other areas to enhance libraries in our state,” Giwa added.
