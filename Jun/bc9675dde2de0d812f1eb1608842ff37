Gunmen have razed the Omuma Divisional Police Headquarters in the Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State. The torching of the police building came after fleeing gunmen razed the Isu Divisional Police Headquarters in Amandugba on Monday. A spokesperson for the police in the state, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the development, said the attackers were repelled. But our correspondent discovered that the attackers succeeded in torching the security facility after injuring some policemen on duty. A source said the hoodlums succeeded in throwing explosives in the police premises after a gun battle. The burning of the police division is the fifth in one week in the state, after Orij, Atta, Izombe and Isu divisional police headquarters were torched in the state within the time frame. Elkana said, “A similar attempt was made by some hoodlums to attack Omuma Police Division, but they were equally repelled by the gallant policemen on duty. “No life was lost in the two attacks and there were no casualties on the part of the police. The two police stations were not burnt. “There is no security breach or infraction recorded throughout the day in the entire state. This can be attributed to the massive deployment of security personnel across the state by the police and other supporting security agencies, who provided watertight security to the peace loving people of Imo State.” ”Copyright PUNCH.
