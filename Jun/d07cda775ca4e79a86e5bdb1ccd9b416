EXECUTIVE Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Tony Ojukwu, has called for the recognition of the political actors especially election management officials who played active roles in the June 12 elections. Ojukwu said this in a statement signed by the commission’s spokesperson, Fatima Mohammed, Ojukwu, on Sunday. He was said to have made the call during activities to mark Democracy Day, in Abuja, on Saturday. Ojukwu was quoted as saying, “The people who conducted the election should also be remembered because that election of unequalled credibility in Nigeria was conducted by Prof Humphrey Nwosu and his National Commissioners, Resident Electoral Commissioners, Directors and other staff.” He further said, “It will be justice if these citizens who made June 12 democracy day possible by conducting the freest and fairest elections in Nigeria’s history, who at the risk of their lives challenged the military government in court for the annulment of June 12 election, are equally honoured, this is not beyond the government. “This can become a model for national rebirth and call for patriotism and nationalism amongst Nigerians.” Ojukwu also urged Nigerians to seize the opportunity of the ongoing Constitutional reforms to make meaningful contributions to the constitutional amendments so as to have a peaceful and egalitarian society free from discrimination, injustice, inequality, and rancour, where everyone will be happy and fulfilled as a citizen.
