A nutritionist, Mrs Josephine Ogenyi, has urged HIV clients to go for regular testing to ascertain their viral loads. Ogenyi made the plea during a one-day training for 40 caregivers and parents, organised by Kishimi Shelter and Care Foundation in collaboration with the Centre for Integrated Health Programme. She said, “As you know, the government cannot do everything; the Centre for Disease Control, and other partners have paid for viral load testing. “For an individual, it costs over N50,000, which many can’t afford. This testing will help HIV patients to know the level of virus in their blood. Once the virus is below 20 it cannot be transmitted.” Ogenyi said the initiative was based on support from the Centre for Disease Control, and the presidential programme from the United States of America to strenghthen healthy lifestyles in the country. “We are here to train caregivers and parents on how to manage the orphans and vulnerable children in our communities, most especially the indigent ones. We have about 7,010 households and OVC across four Local Government Areas of Gombe State. “The training will help caregivers and parents to manage the adolescent in this time. Following the lack of money, food crisis and you know they are on antiretroviral drugs. For the orphans, we have caregivers who are not their parents, maybe like an uncle, aunty that they are staying with. When we enroll them we make such people their caregivers,” she said.
