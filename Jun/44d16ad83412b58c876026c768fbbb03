SUSPECTED herdsmen from Igangan in Oyo State on Monday night reportedly stormed Imeko, Ogun State and killed three hunters. The herdsmen were said to have left Igangan, a few kilometres away, and invaded a community in Imeko, Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of the state. They were reportedly resisted by hunters in the area from wrecking havoc. Our correspondent gathered that three of the hunters reportedly lost their lives in the gun duel between the herdsmen and the hunters. A source in the area told our correspondent that residents of the areas were now apprehensive over the incident. The source said the operatives of the security outfit launched by the state government last month asked the hunters to face the herdsmen while they went to sleep. The source said, “Three hunters were killed overnight by Fulani herdsmen that left Igangan.” When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. Oyeyemi however described the incident as a robbery case. He said, “They were farmers from Benin Republic that usually worked in Nigeria. They were riding on okada and ran into the people that were laying ambush in the bush. They killed them and took the okada away. “We don’t know whether they are herdsmen or not. It was more or less like a case of robbery because they took away their okada.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
