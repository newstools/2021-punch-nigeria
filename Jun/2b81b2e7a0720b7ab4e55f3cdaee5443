AN accidental discharge from a loaded policeman’s rifle injured at least seven persons at a defection rally in Yala, Cross River State, on Saturday. It was gathered in Calabar on Tuesday that the gun was carried by a policeman attached to an appointee of the state governor, who was at the rally held in Echumofana community, in the Yala Local Government Area. Eyewitnesses said at least seven persons were injured when the rifle fell out of the hands of the policeman and went off amidst a crowd of onlookers who surged forward to catch a glimpse of the Director General of Due Process and Price Intelligence Bureau, Mr. Alphonsus Eba, who was being received into the All-Progressives Congress, from the Peoples Democratic Party. An eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, “The gun was probably not on safety mode, so when it fell off the police orderly while trying to protect Mr Eba from the surging crowd, the gun got to the ground and started discharging automatically.” Copyright PUNCH.
