The Lagos State Government has created a health and safety training for young ones to proactively react in times of accidents and emergencies. The Director General of Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr Lanre Omojola, stated this Tuesday during the training in first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation for secondary schools at the Youth Centre, Onikan. Omojola said, “We are teaching these students, 200 of them, practical life-saving skills. We started this programme last month during which we trained youth corps members. We will continue to train and re-train our students in secondary schools, even driving it down to the primary schools. At the end of the day, everybody will have some form of safety training.” Omojola stressed that more people need to know what to do when emergency situations occurred and how to administer first aid or preliminary resuscitation on victims. “The society we live in is such that when incidents occur; some people don’t know what they are supposed to do. They bring out their mobile phones and start to take pictures and record videos. “But when an emergency situation occurs, the first thing to do is to call the emergency numbers; if you have practical skills in first aid or preliminary resuscitation, you can start to give these to ensure that the person is resuscitated,” he added. ”Copyright PUNCH.
