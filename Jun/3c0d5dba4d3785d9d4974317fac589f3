SUSPECTED Fulani herdsmen again struck in Benue State, killing 11 persons in some communities in two local government areas of the state. According to locals, the suspected herders attacked Anyom community of Mbatyula council ward in Katsina-Ala on Wednesday, while some herdsmen also invaded Zongo-Akiki village in Mbalagh council ward in Makurdi Local Government Areas. One of the locals in Makurdi LGA said that the suspected herdsmen stormed Zongo-Akiki community in the early hours of Thursday where they killed five persons. The Chairman of Makurdi LGA, Anthony Dyegeh, who confirmed the killing of the persons, said the youths were still searching for the missing persons. Dyegeh said, “The Fulani laid ambush for some villagers who were going to the farm this morning, knowing full well that many of the villagers would be going to farm after the downpour. “They hid in the bush and allowed many of them to go and then ran after them, macheted them. As am talking to you now, we have been able to recover five corpses and the youths are searching for others who are still missing.” The second attack at Anyom community of Mbatyula council ward in Katsina-Ala was said to have occurred Wednesday afternoon. According to the media aide to the chairman of Katsina Ala LGA, Tertsea Benga, six persons were reportedly killed. Benga told journalists that the attackers invaded the victims’ farmlands with their cows, adding that the herders killed the farmers they met on the farm and took away some women while the whereabouts of others remained unknown. But the state Command’s spokesperson, Catherine Anene, said she had yet to get any detail about the two incidents. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
