The Birch Freeman Old Boys Association has urged old students to give back to their alma mater, saying such a gesture will help to improve education standards in the country. The Global President of the group, Babatunde Adenekan, stated this during the 2021 Homecoming event of the association at Ikeja, Lagos. The event was said to be a climax of activities, which included the donation of different items to their school, such as a grand piano and sports equipment, among others. Adenekan said, “We are also building a football pitch for them so that we can say in a few years time that one of the football players in Manchester United, for instance, is from Birch Freeman. We want to be able to catch them young, train and build them. “Government cannot do it alone. Old students should endeavour to give back to their alma mater in every area.” The founder of BIFOBA, Dipo Olokun, said he started the association in 1980, adding that he was glad the school produced prominent people, including the current Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. ”Copyright PUNCH.
