THE All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party have accused each other of fueling the embers of disunity and hate among Nigerians. While the APC is accusing the PDP of rejoicing over the growing spate of killings and general insecurity, the PDP said the ruling party was responsible for the seemingly endless bloodshed. The APC in a statement titled, ‘APC mourns Ahmed Gulak, calls for collective action against criminality,’ which was signed by its acting National Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in Abuja, on Monday, accused the PDP of lacking empathy. Akpanudoedehe said, “While a majority of Nigerians sympathise with the victims of crimes in the country, it is discernible that the Peoples Democratic Party is apparently excited about the security incidents being perpetrated by evil-doers against the citizens.” The APC appealed to all well-meaning Nigerians to support the government at all levels to fight crime and criminality. The APC was responding to an earlier statement issued by the PDP in which the party accused it of complicity in the ongoing bloodshed across Nigeria. The PDP had in a statement titled, ‘APC Responsible For Bloodletting In Nigeria – PDP,’ signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, urged Nigerians to hold the APC responsible for the growing crime wave. In another statement titled, ‘PDP Insists APC is Responsible for Killings in Nigeria…Berates APC For Seeking To Politicize Gulak’s Murder,’ issued on Monday, Ologbondiyan said, “The PDP stands by its findings and declaration that the APC and its leaders are responsible for the killings, bloodletting and acts of terrorism in our country.” Copyright PUNCH.
