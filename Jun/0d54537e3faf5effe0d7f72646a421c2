The Nigerian men’s 4x100m relay team will not compete at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games after missing their last chance to qualify on Sunday. It’s the third consecutive time the country will fail to qualify for the event. Nigerian quartet Enoch Adegoke, Jerry Jakpa, Godson Brume and Usheoritse Itsekiri was left disappointed after they failed to meet the 38.46secs target needed to get to No.16 on the Top List at the Making of Champions Relays at the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos. The team won the final in a Season Best time 38.53secs. The men’s 4x400m team also failed to secure qualification, losing to Senegal in the final. There was however some good news, as the mixed  4x400m hit the qualification mark after running a National Record time of 3:14.09 to win the final and book a spot in Tokyo. The winning time meant Nigeria, who were anchored by Chidi Okezie, moved from 25th on the Top List to 15th ahead of Czech Republic. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
