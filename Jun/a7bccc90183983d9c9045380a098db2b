The Registrar and Chief Executive Officer, Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria, Dr Tosan Erhabor, has said no medical laboratory in Nigeria will be allowed to practise without having international accreditation. Erhabor said this on Thursday in an interview with our correspondent on the sidelines of the presentation of the ISO 15189-2012 accreditation certificate to Total Healthcare Diagnostic Limited, Ibadan. He lauded the facility for being the second laboratory to get an ISO accreditation certificate in the country, saying the significance of the event was that test results from the laboratory and any other which has international accreditation could be used anywhere in the world. Erhabor said, “Now that Nigeria has signed into the Africa Free Trade Zone, come 2025, no facility in Nigeria would be able to participate in rendering quality service when not accredited. “By that, no laboratory will be allowed to carry out tests in Nigeria without the accreditation. We are calling on private facilities to look into the issue of accreditation.” Speaking, the Medical Laboratory Director, THDL, Mrs Funmilola Mapayi, said to address current and future health challenges, focus on diagnosis and early intervention, timely and accurate lab results were necessary for the quality of patient care.
