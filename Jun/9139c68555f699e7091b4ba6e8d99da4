The Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has been asked to release the details of expenditure on payment of N9.4bn by the Federal Government to the stakeholders of key Digital Switch Over. In a letter with the titled,  ‘Request for information on the N9.4b approved by the Federal Executive Council pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOI ACT 2011),’ addressed to Mohammed by Civil Society Network Against Corruption, the minister was asked to make available to the public how the N9.4b funds were spent. The CSNAC is a coalition with 140 affiliate members across Nigeria. The letter, signed by the Chairman of CSNAC, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, reads partly, “Nigerians have the right to know how the funds were spent. We are making the request in the overall public interest and in line with transparency and accountability in public administration.” Suraju alleged that the funds were frittered amidst reports of corruption. “Some N2.5bn of the funds, for instance, was given as seed grant to a private company which led to the suspension and arraignment of a former Director-General of the National Broadcasting Commission. “We have given you seven days to respond to the request. This is necessary for the Information Ministry to avoid necessary charges in the court of law,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
