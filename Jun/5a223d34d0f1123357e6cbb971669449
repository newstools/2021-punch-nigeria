The House of Representatives has called on the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to probe the Sanyo Police Station in Ibadan, Oyo State,  for allegedly releasing a hit-and-run driver without investigation. A member of the House from Oyo State, Tolulope Akande-Sadipe, at the plenary on Thursday moved a motion to accuse the station of subverting justice. Her motion, which was unanimously adopted by the lawmakers, was titled, ‘Need to Investigate the Activities of Sanyo Police Station, Ibadan, Oyo State.’ Akande-Sadipe said, “The House notes that on Thursday, May 13, 2021, along Olomi Road, Oluyole, Ibadan, a young man named Mr Raji Idris was knocked unconscious by a drunk driver, Mr Dele Ayanjompe, who fled the scene afterwards, according to eye witness accounts. “The House also notes that the victim was taken to the Frontida Clinic where it was confirmed that he had suffered trauma to his brain and life severe injuries, and thus underwent extensive surgery to increase his chances of survival after which he has remained in a coma since then. “The House is disturbed that while the victim battles for his life, the driver who hit him has been released by the Divisional Police Officer at Sanyo Police Station without any charges as the Investigating Police Officer, Sergeant Muritala, has allegedly colluded with the driver.” Adopting the motion, the House “urge the Inspector General of Police to investigate the activities of officers at Sanyo Police Station, with a view to punishing officers involved in subjugation of the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
