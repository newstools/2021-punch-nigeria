Sterling Bank Plc, in partnership with StearsData, has released a report for the agriculture sector in Nigeria. According to a statement by the bank, the four-page Agriculture Industry Report 2021 would provide an up-to-date view of the challenges and opportunities in Nigeria’s agriculture sector in a COVID-19 era. The report advised policymakers to protect the blossoming innovation ecosystem in the sector with consistent policies and collaborate to foster growth. It suggested a value chain approach ‘so critical links are not ignored when designing solutions for the sector’. “As Nigeria inches out of another recession, there is no better time to take steps that support its resolute claims that the performance of its agriculture sector is key to its long-term growth,” it said. The Group Head of Agric Finance and Solid Mineral, Sterling Bank, Bukola Awosanya, said the industry report would empower players in the agriculture sector with a navigation roadmap. Copyright PUNCH.
