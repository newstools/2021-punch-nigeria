The Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, has demanded justice for a slain 300-level student of the University of Ilorin, Blessing Olajide. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Olajide, who until her death was a student of the Agricultural Science Department, was allegedly raped and murdered in her room in Ilorin. In a statement by the Kwara State Governor on Friday, he condemned the killing of Olajide as he called on security agencies to take action in identifying the culprits. “I mourn the shocking and utterly condemnable reported rape and murder of Miss Olajide Omowumi Blessing, a 300-level student of the University of Ilorin by some yet-to-be-identified persons. “The development is heart-wrenching and absolutely unacceptable. Such antisocial and despicable behaviour will never be acceptable to all people of a good conscience, and all of us will unite to fight this to a logical conclusion. “I call on the security agencies to get to the root of this dastardly act with a view to bringing the mindless perpetrators to book. “I similarly call on anyone with valuable information to volunteer same to the security agencies. “I sincerely commiserate with the parents of the deceased, her course/ housemates, and the university community on this sad incident, while praying the Almighty God to repose her soul. “I join every person of good conscience to seek justice for Blessing so that such callous action and its perpetrators will never find a foothold in our society. “I hereby send strong warnings that we will not tolerate indiscriminate violence against any person, much less the girl child. “Enough is enough! The security agencies will get the perpetrators to pay heavily for this crime,” the statement read.
