A notable activist in Delta State, Harrison Gwamnishu, on Wednesday alleged assassination attempt on his life by some “men riding in police van”. Gwamnishu, in a video he shared on his Facebook page, showed some men riding in a police van with one of them pulling out his gun and attempted to fire at him. In the video titled, ‘They pointed the gun and pulled the trigger’, the message narrated how he miraculously escaped. “Today, I escaped assassination attempt by some men dressed in black, driving a black Hilux vehicle with the inscription, ‘Police’ (Nigeria Police), fully armed with AK-47 rifle. “This happened today at 1:40 pm (at a place) before (getting to) the Asaba International Airport. Immediately I noticed I was being trailed, I held my phone with my left hand and drove with my right hand. “I don’t know who they are or who sent them. The Delta State Police should immediately fish them out. This is the second assassination attempt. My time has not come,” the video further indicated. When contacted over the incident, the acting Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, Bright Edafe simply said, “Matter resolved already.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
