The Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) has urged the ExxonMobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited to comply with the recent Federal High Court judgement which ordered it to pay N81.9bn as compensation for oil spills from the company’s facilities which occurred between 2000 and 2010. The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had in a judgement given ExxonMobil and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 14 days’ ultimatum to pay N81.9bn to the fishing and farming communities in the Ibeno Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The affected fishing and farming communities in Akwa Ibom State had dragged ExxonMobil and the NNPC to court, demanding adequate compensation for oil spills that destroyed their rivers, streams and other sources of livelihood. The Executive Director of ERA/FoEN, Godwin Ojo, described the court ruling on the case as a landmark judgement in the long walk to environmental justice and protection of the environment and livelihood. Ojo said, “The judgement is also significant because payment of compensation to the victims of oil pollution will impact positively on the lives of the people of the Niger Delta suffering under the heavy burden of oil spills pollution and destruction of their livelihood. “The judgement represents a conflict arbitration resolution mechanism that will help to rekindle hope in the court system that justice may be delayed by oil companies with war chest for huge legal fees, but cannot be denied. There is no more hiding place for oil companies and they should take full responsibility to comply immediately, clean up and pay up compensation. By this victory, the affected people will no longer resort to self-help.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
