A soldier attached to the 14 Brigade of the Nigerian Army in Ohafia was on Saturday reportedly shot during a clash between the military and unknown gunmen, suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network. It was learnt that trouble started when the gunmen stormed the popular Ebem motor park in the Ohafia Local Government Area of the state and shot indiscriminately. The shooting was said to have attracted soldiers from the Army Headquarters, in Ohafia, who engaged the suspected ESN members in an exchange of gunfire. It was learnt that the injured soldier was taken to Federal Medical Center, Umuahia, for treatment. The pandemonium was said to have forced many residents of Elu, Amangwu, Ebem and Amaekpu to flee to neighbouring villages to avoid being caught up in the crossfire. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, could not be reached to confirm the report. But a source who did not want to be identified said, “We learnt that some boys believed to be members of the Eastern Security Network came to the popular Ebem motor park and started shooting and later left. Soldiers from 14 Brigade, Ohafia, whose command headquarters is located in the area, later came and went after them. “We learnt that the unknown gunmen shot a soldier with a double-barrel gun but (he’s) not dead. He’s currently at Federal Medical Center Umuahia, currently receiving medical attention and since that time, there have been sporadic gunshots from all corners.”
