The National Labour Congress has joined the world in celebrating the second anniversary of the Violence and Harassment Convention, C190. In a statement signed by Acting General Secretary, Ismail Bello, and released on its website on Monday, the labour union said it has reactivated the National Labour Advisory Council of Nigeria. “One of the major achievements is the reactivation of the National Advisory Council of Nigeria which has been dormant for the last seven years. However, due to the sustained struggles and advocacy by the National Labour Council, the body was reconstituted and inaugurated in March 2021, to speed up the process of ratification which is ongoing in the Ministry of Labour,” the statement said. It added, “The train of progress towards the elimination of violence and harassment in the World of Work took off with the adoption of C190 and Recommendation 206 in June 2019. “It is now two years in motion and the momentum has been sustained by education, media and public enlightenment, awareness campaigns, lobby, advocacy and the resilience of working people of the world especially women activists.” The union expressed hopes that Nigeria would consummate the rectification of C190 soon.
