Africa business leaders are more confident in the strength of the global economy and in their organization’s ability to grow their revenues in the next three years than they were a year ago, a new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers has said. About 68 per cent of Africa Chief Executive Officers believe that the global economy will improve in the next 12 months, according to insights shared at the virtual media launch of the 8th edition of the PwC’s Africa Business Agenda 2021 report on Friday. The report said policy uncertainty, tax policy uncertainty, cyber threats and over-regulation were some of the concerns of the business executives. It added that while 42 per cent of CEOs in Africa were very confident of their revenue growth in the next three years, only 30 per cent of the CEOs were very confident about their companies’ growth prospects in the next 12 months. Speaking on the issue of cyber threats, Partner and Technology Leader, PwC West Market Area, Femi Osinubi, said most CEOs had seen a significant rise in the use of technology and automation, as they were great drivers when considering how to improve organisations’ competitiveness. He noted that while the pandemic had brought about a significant increase in digital adoption and transactions, it had also increased the associated risks such as misinformation, mistrust and cyber insecurity. Fiscal Policy Partner and PwC Africa Tax Leader, Taiwo Oyedele, said, “Plummeting government revenues and fragile economic growth are fueling an increase in government debt across Africa.
