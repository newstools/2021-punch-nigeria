The Federal Capital Territory Water Board on Sunday said the outbreak of cholera in the territory had nothing to do with the board. The board’s acting General Manager, Dr Joy Okoro, said this while speaking with journalists in Abuja. Recall that the acting Secretary, FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat, Dr Mohammed Kawu, said last week that 91 suspected cases had so far been recorded in the FCT, adding that seven deaths were recorded. But Okoro said its water had never been and would never be contaminated. She said, “The treatment we put in takes care of everything. That is the essence of water treatment to take care of any possible impurity and make the resource safe for consumption.” “That is what the board has been doing and it will continue to do it because the FCTA attaches so much value to the lives of Nigerians and all residents. “So, we are assuring all of them that our water is very pure, very good for drinking and very potable. And it is not just one but four treatment plants at the Lower Usman Dam; and the FCT administration, through the Minister, Muhammad Bello, continues to give us enabling environment. “We have all the chemicals for water treatment and we do carry out water treatment judiciously, so as to serve our customers best quality water. Our staff work 24/7, especially those in the production area to make sure that all the residents are well served potable water.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
