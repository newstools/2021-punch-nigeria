The Minister of Transport, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, has identified inequality and extreme poverty as the bane of Nigeria’s underdevelopment. According to him, for Nigeria to attain any meaningful progress, inequality and extreme poverty must first be addressed. He stated these while delivering the 49th Convocation Lecture of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, on Saturday. The minister regretted that in spite of different poverty alleviation programmes, Nigerians were still bogged down by crippling poverty. Amaechi said many people were homeless and jobless, which was among issues that gave rise to insecurity in the form of insurgency and agitations like #EndSARS and self-determination being canvassed in some sections of Nigeria. He said hitherto poor nations like India and Brazil were able to curb poverty in their enclave, pointing out that in the past 10 years, India lifted 273,000 of its citizens from abject poverty, while Brazil, between 2001 and 2009, lifted 21,000 of its citizens from acute poverty. “There are areas that we must address if we hope to overcome our frightening inequality and poverty. We must free our policies from an urban-based focus. The poorest urban Nigerian is many times better off than the most well-off rural Nigerian. Therefore, we need to emulate the Chinese and Indian examples in focusing on the rural majority if we must end the increasing marginalization of our rural compatriots. “Inequality has produced an anarchic population as life has become a scramble and a hustle among many. Poverty-induced criminality has sent crime statistics through the roof nationwide resulting in the culture of perennial insecurity that now haunts the nation,” Amaechi said. Copyright PUNCH.
