The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has expressed sadness over the death of the Chairman of Eti-Osa East Local Council Development Area of the State, Olufunmi Olatunji. Olatunji, who was the Chairman of the Eti-Osa East LCDA and the All Progressives Congress chairmanship candidate for the July 24 local government elections in Lagos State, died on Monday. The governor, in a condolence message on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, said the late Olatunji was a “loyal politician and an invaluable asset to the All Progressives Congress.” “The death of Olufunmi Olatunji is a painful and great loss to Lagos State. I am saddened by the death of this fine gentleman; a loyal party man and committed democrat. “There is no doubting the fact that he would be missed by the entire political class, particularly Eti-Osa East LCDA, Lagos APC family and the state as a whole,” he added. Sanwo-Olu also condoled with the immediate family of the late chairman, the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Lagos APC, Conference 57 and the entire people of Eti-Osa East LCDA.
