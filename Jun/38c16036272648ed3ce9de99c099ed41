ExpressVPN, a provider of Virtual Private Networks, has said it had recorded an increase of over 200 per cent in web traffic from Nigeria since the Federal Government banned Twitter. Since the government suspended Twitter operations, users have had to bypass their Internet provider blockade on the social media site through the use of VPNs. The company said it had its biggest spike on June 6, as web traffic increased by around 250 per cent from the previous day, according to Nairametrics. Although there has been a massive switch to VPNs, there have however been concerns about the risk associated with the use of VPNs, such as sharing user data with a third party or breaching privacy. ExpressVPN said, “We do not collect anything that would allow ExpressVPN or anyone else to match an individual to specific network activity or behaviour. We have designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers. Even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess. “We do not collect logs of activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of IP addresses, outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration. Essentially, we do not store or collect any data that could identify an individual and their online activity.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
