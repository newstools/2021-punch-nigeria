Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, Tony Aziegbemi, have been suspended over alleged misconduct said to have caused disaffection within the party. In a statement signed by the State Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, the decision was taken at a State Working Committee meeting that held at the state party secretariat on Tuesday, with two-third majority of members resolving in a motion that the state chairman, Tony Aziegbemi, should step aside from his position. The party leaders also resolved that the State Deputy Chairman, Harrison Omagbon, will act as chairman until the determination of the allegations levied against Aziegbemi. The statement further read, “An Investigative Committee is hereby set up, headed by the State Legal Adviser Barr. Arthur Esene, and is mandated to report back to the Working Committee within one week. Other members of the Committee are Mrs. Linsdale Tes Sorae (State Woman Leader) and Dr. Wilson Imongan (State Auditor). “Amongst the allegations, Dr. Tony Aziegbemi was accused of gross misconduct by brewing unnecessary tension and disunity among party members in the state in a manner akin to bringing the party into disrepute. “This decision hard as it is, is designed to bring sanity back to our party.
It would be like ignoring the elephant in the room if we ignore this macabre dance as Edo people have watched in utter amazement and disappointment how Aziegbemi has been roped and entangled by his actions and unfortunately too, his inactions in the management of the affairs of the party. “We are a very disciplined party and pride ourselves as organised and focused on service delivery to our teeming supporters and of course Edo people. “We urge our members and supporters to please remain calm as we embark on this self-cleansing exercise. PDP is listening to the cries of Edo people.”
