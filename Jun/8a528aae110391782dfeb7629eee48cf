The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has directed the state Head of Service, Dr Chibuzor Iwuagwu, to establish public safety units in all ministries, department and agencies, among others, in the state. Uzodinma gave this directive on Tuesday when he declared open a two-day Imo safety and fire summit in Owerri, the capital of the state. The governor vowed to restore peace to the state, saying all the policies and regulations to actualise this would soon be unfolded. He, therefore, enjoined all communities in the state to cooperate with his administration in its safety drive. He described safety and peace as indispensable ingredients for the growth and development of any society and assured that his administration would pursue them with vigour. Uzodinma, who was represented by his deputy, Prof. Placid Njoku, thanked the organisers of the summit for their vision and wisdom. “The strategic geographical location of the state is that the security should not be compromised; hence, safety must be applied in all activities of governmental and non-governmental organisations in the state,” he said. In his address, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Safety Unit, Prince Ugochukwu Nzekwe, said the summit was designed to share analytical ideas and proffer professional solutions to the lingering security issue in the state.
