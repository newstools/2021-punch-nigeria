The Lagos State Government on Monday said it was training its field officers and consultants on the use of a newly introduced Lagos State property tax software mobile application for effective property administration. The government said the move was part of its ‘Smart City’ initiative. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Mrs Oyeyemi Ayoola, stated this at the workshop held at the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Alausa, Ikeja. Ayoola said the new mobile application would make land use charge operations more flexible and seamless. She said, “The new mobile app was designed to improve land use charge operations, enhance revenue base and expand the quality of data and its availability in the state.” Ayoola noted that the workshop was set up to build the capacity of field officers in new technology and train them towards property administration in the state. “The aim of the workshop is to train LUC field officers, consultants and administrators on the functionalities and technicalities of the new mobile application developed by Deta Mainingu Limited for effective property administration in Lagos State. “The workshop will help build the capacity of field officers in application of the new technology and ultimately improve property enumeration as well as LUC revenue generation,” she added. She enjoined the participants to utilise technology in developing themselves and assisting the government in attaining its goal of transforming Lagos into a smart city. Copyright PUNCH.
