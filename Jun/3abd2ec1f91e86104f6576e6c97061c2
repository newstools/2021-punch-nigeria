THE Akwa Ibom State Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, has ordered the arrest of a police constable, Daniel Edet, for allegedly demanding sex and extorting money from a suspect. Edet, attached to Etim Ekpo Command, in a video posted by one Da Zion Umoh, was said to have allegedly solicited for sex and collected the sum of N60,000 as bail after some persons were arrested. The commissioner, in a statement on Sunday by the command’s Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, said such act ran foul of the extant laws and should be properly investigated and the officer punished if found guilty. “The gravity of the above allegation caused the Commissioner of Police to order the arrest of the said officer. He further ordered that a discreet investigation be conducted and immediate disciplinary steps be put in place to punish the offending officer if found wanting,” the statement reads in part. The statement, however, recalled that the author of the post was still standing trial in court on charges of threat to life and conspiracy, adding that he (Da Zion Umoh) had been using his arrest by the police as a vendetta to smear the image of the security agency.
