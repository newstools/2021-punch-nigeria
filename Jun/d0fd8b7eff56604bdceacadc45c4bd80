The All Progressives Congress, Lagos State chapter, has said there is no fresh primary schedule for any council in the state. It added that no result from the primaries held in the 57 councils had been cancelled. It added that although there had been petitions against some candidates for the June 24 local government election in the state, the panel set up on the petitions had yet to sumbit its report. Some aspirants of the party in the state had claimed on Monday that new primary elections had been recommended by the appeal panel. One of the sources said, “Kosofe LGA primary election and some other councils have been nullified by the appeal panel and approved by the party.” But the Lagos APC spokesman, Mr Seye Oladejo, when contacted by our correspondent, said the claim was not true. He said, “There is no report yet by the appeal committee. The committee has yet to conclude its assignment. So, any report of cancelation is fake.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
