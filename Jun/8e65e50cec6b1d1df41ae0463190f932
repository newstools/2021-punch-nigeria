Members of the Joint Health Sector Union at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital on Wednesday began a three-day warning strike to protest against poor condition of service and dilapidated structure, as well as obsolete equipment in the hospital. Declaring the strike after an emergency congress of the union, the Chairman of UITH JOHESU, Olutunde Oluwawumi, directed all members to leave their offices and go to their respective homes to compel the management to respond to their demands. Oluwawumi said the management of the hospital had refused to pay the three years promotion arrears of workers from 2018, 2019 to 2020, adding that “the management as of now has yet to conclude the promotion exercise of workers for 2021.” He added, “The UITH management also refused to honour the court judgement on the payment of ‘skipping arrears’ owed workers in 2010, 2011 and 2012, while nurses uniform arrears for one and half years are still pending.” He also alleged that the National Health Insurance Scheme had not been fully implemented in the hospital as drugs prescription for ailments were not always available in the hospital. Oluwawumi also called for renovation of dilapidated structure, while obsolete equipment should be replaced. The Head of Corporate Affairs Unit of UITH, Mrs Olabisi Ajiboye, said the management of the hospital was looking at the complaints of JOHESU and would soon issue a statement. She said, “The management has received the complaints of JOHESU and it is looking into it. For now, we don’t have anything to say, but in due course, we will issue a statement.” Copyright PUNCH.
