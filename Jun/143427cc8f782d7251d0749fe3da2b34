The messages in my music are about love, motivation, happiness and hope. “I am currently promoting my new single and I urge my fans and other music lovers to listen to it.

I’ve had financial challenges and there were times I wasn’t sure of myself. Pryme also noted that his music was influenced by some American singers. He said, “Some of the artistes I admire are Chris Brown, R Kelly and Beyonce. I had listened to many of their songs even before I thought of doing music professionally.

I could be inspired by anything, including love or even anger.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
