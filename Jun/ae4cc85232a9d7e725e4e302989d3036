The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has restated his administration’s commitment to eradicating the maternal and child deaths in the state. Sanwo-Olu, who spoke on Monday during the inauguration of a four-floor 110-bed maternal and childcare centre in Epe, added that the government would use smart investments in the health sector to improve the health indices of women and children. He said, “In the last two years, we have shown great commitment to the improvement of maternal and child health indices in the state. This four-floor, 110 bed-maternal child centre is another essential facility for safe childbirth and the reduction of maternal and infant mortality. Our goal is to eradicate infant and child mortality in our state. Our women must no longer die while giving life.” Sanwo-Olu stated that his plan was to build new maternal-child centres across Lagos while renovating and upgrading existing health facilities. “We are not done, our plan is to build maternal child centres across the state to improve the access of expectant mothers to the best pre and post-natal care. “Where necessary, we will build new health facilities; where appropriate, we will renovate and upgrade existing health facilities; you can, however, rest assured that all over Lagos State, our health facilities will be fully equipped and staffed to meet the health needs of all Lagosians, this is our promise,” he added.
