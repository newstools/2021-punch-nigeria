The Ondo State Government has said the herdsmen in the state are yet to comply with its directive on registration of their cattle business with the state government. The state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, had ordered that the herdsmen who want to do legitimate business of cattle rearing should register with the government through the office of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matter but the herdsmen were said to have failed to register. The Secretary to the State Government, Oladunni Odu, stated this on Wednesday at a two-day lecture for the participants of the Senior Executive Course 43, 2021 of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos. The programme which was held at PSTI auditorium, Ilara Mokin, in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, was themed, ‘Getting things done: Strategies for policy and programme implementation in Nigeria.’ Odu said, “We did not ban open grazing overnight in Ondo State. The governor at the beginning did say if you are here to rear cattle and follow our forests, please come forward and register otherwise you will be staying in our forest illegally. He gave them the opportunity to come and register but they did not come to register as the governor has allowed them in Ondo State.” The SSG, who welcomed the participants to the state, also said that the would replicate the Federal Government’s National Policy on Ageing for Older Persons in Ondo State, saying the state government has been taking care of the aged people in the state. “Since the Federal Government has done it, we will replicate it in Ondo State. We have been taking care of the aged from time to time. Even during the 100 days celebration (of the second term of the governor) we are going to give N5,000 to 40 elderly people in each of the 18 local governments in the state, ” she noted.
