THE Adamawa State chapter of the All Progressive Congress and its counterpart in the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, have disagreed over the performance score card of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). State action Chairman of the APC, Ibrahim Bilal, while presenting the midterm scorecard, of the APC-led Federal Government, as part of the Democracy Day celebration, on Saturday, berated the PDP-controlled state government for underperformance. Bilal said, “We know there’s a government in the state, yet we joined hands with our appointed stakeholders and elected lawmakers, to attract development to the state. “The contributions of the APC stakeholders led by appointees at the federal level, the SGF, our elected officials have contributed immensely in growth, development and uplifting the welfare of the citizens of the state which some persons are trying to claim as their achievements in office.” In response, Director General Media and Communications, Government House, Solomon Kumangar, dismissed APCs claims. He said, “Governor Fintiri’s, giant strides in the state through his laudable projects that is visible even to the blind.” He said Bilal must own up to the defeat of his party in the 2019 elections under his watch which he added the party had yet to recover from.
