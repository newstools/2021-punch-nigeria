Popular Nigerian filmmaker, Jeta Amata, has raised an alarm stating that he does not know the whereabouts of his ex-wife, Mbong. The couple who have a daughter together, Veno, got married in 2008. However, they separated in 2013 and were divorced by 2014. In an Instagram post, the moviemaker stated that Mbong has been missing from social media since January and has not been in contact with their daughter, Veno, who is worried about the whereabouts of her mum. He wrote, “Can somebody please just ask why Mbong has gone missing from social media all year? No one seems to know anything and it’s affecting my daughter, that no one would tell us. She wants to see her mother. If she is not well, Veno wants to go and be by her side and we need to know to stop worrying.” Checking the Instagram page of the former beauty queen turned actress, she last posted a picture on January 17.
