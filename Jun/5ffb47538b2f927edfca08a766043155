Ultimate Health Management Services has said that employers hire staff with the right attitude, personality and teachable spirit. The company said this in Lagos at the NECA Annual Employers’ Excellence Awards where the firm received an award as the Best Employer of Labour in the health insurance industry. In an interview with our correspondent, the Managing Director, Ultimate Health HMO, Mr Lekan Ewenla, said, “At Ultimate Health HMO, we employ staff and don’t expect them to know it all. We don’t look for workers; we look for builders. “We encourage our workers’ contribution to be measurable while placing a lot of premium on our staff satisfaction and happiness on the job.  First, we ensure that the environment is conducive and provide adequate training and motivation.” Ewenla added that staff who are adequately motivated, become good ambassadors of the company. He added, “This award is significant as it has shown that Ultimate Health HMO is setting the pace for others in the health insurance industry to follow. “The award is not for the management of the organisation but everyone in the system. At Ultimate, we treat everyone the way we want to be treated.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
