The Vice President of the Nigeria Society of Engineering, Adeniran Ibitoye, has advised students of Elizade University, Ilara Mokin, Ondo State, to show a high level of professionalism to attain greater heights. Ibitoye gave the charge at the induction of the pioneer engineering students into the Automotive National Students’ Forum, held on the campus of the institution in Ilara Mokin. Ibitoye, who is also a Special Adviser to the Governor of Osun State on Water Resources and Energy, urged the students to be marketable with quintessential qualities and become successful automotive engineers. He said “The students must also be innovative through the blend of theories, practical, training and software skills acquisition as well as creativity through the use of their talents, time and treasure as human capital assets. “It is evident that engineering practice and profession is as old as mankind. Hence, engineers are problem solvers and quality service providers through the understanding of technical concepts, professional risk management, safety precautions and standards with reference to ethics, code of conduct, laws, policies and excellent oral and written communication skills, among others.” The National Chairman of the AutoEI, Dr. Abubakar Jumare, urged the lecturers of the institution to do all they could to groom and mentor the students with a view to preparing them for the challenges ahead. He also challenged them to set up a chapter of AutoEI under Akure Branch of the NSE. According to him, AutoEl would continue to collaborate with Elizade University to see to the success of all its engineering programmes. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
