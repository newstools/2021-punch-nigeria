Actress, Destiny Etiko, has recounted her experience carrying a python in a movie she starred in. Speaking during an Instagram Live session monitored by Saturday Beats, she said, “The movie, ‘Idemili’, gave me ‘life’. When I got the role, I was told that I would be carrying a snake. My mother actually encouraged me to take the role. She said the snake would not harm me. I then went ahead to carry the snake. I was neither the lead nor sub-lead character in the movie though. I only had 10 scenes in the movie but they were very significant. It is one movie I cannot forget in a hurry. The snake we used was a python and the good thing is that it is not poisonous, so it was not so difficult for me. But, I was not the only one that carried the snake in the movie. My senior colleague, Eve Esin, also carried a snake. I almost wet my pants when it was dropped on my neck because it was so cold. When we came back on set the next day, they put two snakes on me. And, the funny thing is that the snakes slept off on my body. It was quite a memorable experience.” Etiko also stated that her kissing scenes in movies were mostly real. She said, “Most of the kisses I give in my movies are real though. If one wants to do it well, one has to make it real.” The actress, who is famed for her curves, also stated that contrary to what the roles she plays in movies portray, she is a soft person. She added, “I am not a tough person. I am actually very soft. My astrological sign is ‘Leo’ and I’m a lioness. I am also a queen. You could see me in action (in movies) and think I am going to kill my husband. But, that cannot happen. ‘Future husband, don’t run away please. Don’t think I am going to kill you’.” Copyright PUNCH.
