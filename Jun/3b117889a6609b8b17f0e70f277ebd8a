A woman, Mrs Victoria Agori, whose 19-year-old son was killed by men of the Inspector General of Police Monitoring Unit in Rivers State, has expressed worry over the failure of the panel probing police brutality in Abuja to resume sitting for over three months. Mrs Agori’s son, Daniel, was reportedly arrested alongside some of the family members after an alleged disagreement between him and his elder sister. The teenager was said to have been shot dead inside the IGP Monitoring Unit office in Aluu, Rivers State, in the presence of his mother. Speaking with The PUNCH on Saturday, the woman said several attempts to get justice for her son had been unsuccessful, adding that the silence of the Abuja panel was disturbing. She said, “Since March till date, the panel has not been sitting. The situation is affecting my cry for justice. I need justice for my child who was murdered by the Police IGP unit in Rivers State. “We were there (Abuja panel) on March 17 when the panel sat last. My matter and those of others were adjourned till April 15. But on that day, I was at the panel in Abuja and they did not sit. “I am begging them to continue with their work. Those victimised by the police need justice. My son was killed in 2019, shot dead in my presence for doing nothing. But I have been trying for the past two years to get justice to no avail.” Also, the family’s lawyer, Mr. R. A. Olutekunbi, said, “The  panel needs to make a definite statement considering the advanced stages of many of the matters before it, so that the complainants can be properly advised to take appropriate steps in redressing their grievances as provided under the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
