GOVERNOR Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Tuesday inaugurated another batch of personnel into the Ondo State Security Network Agency, Amotekun, in a bid to tackle criminality in the state. The governor also said crime “is a local issue that should be addressed with a large dose of home-grown approach.” Inaugurating the newly recruited 503 personnel of Amotekun in Akure, the state capital, the governor called for the support of all the stakeholders in the fight against insecurity in the state. According to him, the Amotekun Corps initiative was a baby of necessity conceived as a home-grown approach to solving the plethora of security challenges that have put the people on the edge. He said, “It has further reinforced our long time view that state and community-based policing is the panacea to the country’s security challenges. “Let me reassure the good people of Ondo State that our administration will leave no stone unturned as far as the implementation of our ‘REDEEMED Agenda’ is concerned.” Akeredolu, who also inaugurated new 20 patrol vehicles and the official headquarters of the corps at Alagbaka, Akure, commended the leadership of the state security outfit, for its efforts in ameliorating the security challenge in the state, promising to always provide the right leadership for the agency to thrive.
