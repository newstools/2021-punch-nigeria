The Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos State chapter Chairman, Dr Adegbola Dominic, has said the party must win many of the seats available in the local government election in the state scheduled for July 24, 2021. Dominic made this known in a statement on Monday. He said the party in the state must join the winning streak that “will be the portion of the party nationwide.” He added, “To this end, the impending local government election in Lagos State provides an ample opportunity for the party to test-run its machinery towards 2023. The machinery includes the establishment of wards and polling booth structures in all the polling units throughout the state. . “We are determined to win as many councillorship and chairmanship seats as are up for contest. Thus our candidates are hereby assured of logistics and other material support within the reach of the party. “Various Election Committees which are already in place and are functioning shall be encouraged and assisted to achieve success. “I am informed that substantial donations towards the elections are already in possession of the erstwhile managers of the party. We shall ensure that all donations are used for the intended purpose.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
