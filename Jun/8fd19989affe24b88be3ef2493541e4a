A fresh crisis has hit the Benue State chapter of the All Progressives Congress. This followed a series of suspensions and counter suspension of members by factions of the party loyal to separate party leaders. Some members of the party in Gboko Local Government Area, on Wednesday, expelled Becky Orpin and Abua Yaji, two loyalists of the state party leader and Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs; Senator George Akume. In a statement issued by the Public Relations Officer of the APC in Gboko local government, Terfa Ahambe, on Wednesday, read in part, “The APC Gboko local government Chapter, has expelled former Gboko local government chairmen, Mrs. Becky Orpin and Abua Yajir from the party for abuse of the APC constitution, destabilizing party organs and masterminding party crisis. In response, the state party leadership, on Thursday, issued a counter statement titled, “Suspended party members cannot suspend legitimate members.” The statement was signed by James Ornguga, Caretaker State Publicity Secretary of the party. Orgunga said, “The State Working Committee on May 27, 2021 suspended and even expelled some of them based on the degree of their offences “The said ex-party members had grossly embarrassed the APC through impersonation of party offices, issuance of unauthorised publications, factionalisation of the party in Gboko, carrying weapons and engaging in dishonest practices that tended to disrupt the peaceful, lawful and efficient organisation of the Gboko chapter of the party. “Unfortunately, instead of showing remorse for their offences, the group has rather constituted itself into a treacherous gang of traitors, issuing unauthorised suspension orders against legitimate party members who should rather be appreciated for their participation and investments in the party. “Their intention, we have gathered, is to wreak havoc to the APC while planning their exit to other minor political parties….”
