The Lagos State Government has said it paid N32.28bn to 7,998 retirees in two years. The Director-General, Lagos State Pension Commission, Babalola Obilana, disclosed this at the commission’s 85th bond presentation ceremony in Lagos. During the event, 329 Retirement Saving Accounts were credited with over N1bn. He said the welfare of pensioners was a top priority in the state. Obilana stated that one of the targets of the present administration was to successfully conclude the payment of accrued pension rights at the end of the present governor’s first term in office. This, he noted, would enable pensioners to receive their entitlements upon retirement from the state’s public service on a ‘pay as you leave’ basis. He said, “The governor is committed to retirees’ welfare. That is why despite all odds, retirees are still on the front burner of his agenda. “It is clear that the financial freedom of the state’s pensioners is paramount to this administration.” Obilana advised retirees to choose the right option for their needs between annuity and programmed withdrawal. He urged them not to focus on the decision of others but to ensure they selected the choice that best suits them. A retiree, Felicia Ojo, thanked the Lagos State Governor, Mr Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the management and staff of LASPEC for their support for pensioners in Lagos State. Copyright PUNCH.
