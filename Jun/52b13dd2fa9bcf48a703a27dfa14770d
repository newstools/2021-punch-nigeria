The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, has said that over two million rural dwellers have so far benefited from its Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers. The scheme said as part of the health initiative, 300 free wheelchairs had been given to beneficiaries nationwide. Ibrahim said this in a statement while inaugurating the second quarter of the 2021 NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers at  Damagazan Hausawa Community in Kaura District of the Federal Capital Territory during the week. He said, “The NYSC HIRD Project, which was initiated in 2014, is a platform through which people living at the grass roots can benefit from free healthcare implemented by medical personnel by carrying out diagnosis, and treatment, including minor medical procedures and referrals. “Drugs, glasses and other medical consumables were given to patients in the locality free of charge.” According to Ibrahim, other HIRD implementation strategies, like community-based clinics, setting up of clinics for NYSC secretariats, first aid administration and other humanitarian aid were established. Ibrahim said the NYSC had impacted several communities in the country through health-related interventions like campaigns against HIV/AIDS, malaria, prevention and control of Ebola Virus Disease, as well as the recent contributions in the control of COVID-19 pandemic. He also appreciated the support of stakeholders and collaborating non-governmental agencies like the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organisation.
