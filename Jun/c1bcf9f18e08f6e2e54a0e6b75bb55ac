THE South-South zonal town hall meeting on COVID-19 vaccination ended abruptly on Tuesday at the Edo State Government House despite suffering two previous postponements. The meeting was truncated after delegates from across the South-South geographical zone were already seated. Breaking the news of the postponement, Executive Secretary, National Primary Healthcare, Edo State, Dr. Julie Erhabor, said the postponements were not the fault of Governor Godwin Obaseki. She said, “I bring you greetings from our Excellency, our dynamic governor, Godwin Obaseki. He expressed displeasure in this unfolding event. This is the third time the South-South zonal town hall meeting is being postponed due to the fault of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency. “He wants you to know that the postponement has nothing to do with Edo State. It is not a decision from the state. However, we recognise the presence of distinguished personalities and we appreciate you for coming.” Erhabor, however, seized the occasion to state the efforts of the state toward combating the virus. She said, “We have built a very strong and coordinated COVID-19 response team in the state under the leadership of the Governor Obaseki. We have successfully screened over 550,000 Edo residents and conducted over 56,500 PCR test in the state. “We have also identified 4,910 COVID-19 cases and we have treated and discharged 4,725 cases,” she said.
