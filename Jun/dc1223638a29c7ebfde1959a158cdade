A supporter of the late Chief M. K. O. Abiola, Chief Abimbola Aboderin, has urged politicians to not only immortalise the late businessman and politician, but also emulate him. He said this in a statement on Sunday Sunday to herald the presentation of his book, ‘Democracy and the untold story of June 12,’ billed to hold on June 12 at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, Lagos. Aboderin said, “I wrote this book which took my efforts, time and intellect from the point of my closeness to the late billionaire, humanist and lover of his people.  I can say categorically that we are four people who knew Abiola politically from a very close relationship. It was from that standpoint that I wrote. Aboderin commended the immortalisation of Abiola by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, but maintained that such gesture was not enough. He said, “Because if you declare June 12 Democracy Day, and our leaders are not towing the ideals of which Abiola stood for, it is not edifying enough. The real immortalisation is his politics with a human face philosophy which he exhibited, making him the darling of his people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
