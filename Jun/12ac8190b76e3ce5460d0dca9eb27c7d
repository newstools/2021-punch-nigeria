UFC welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, will arrive Nigeria today (Thursday) to initiate a community activation plan for the people of Edo State, The PUNCH reports. Kamaru who is on a 19-fight winning streak, the longest ever in the welterweight division, was born in Nigeria, but has not visited since he migrated to the US with his family as an eight-year-old. The PUNCH also learnt that Kamaru would visit Lagos, where he would be the guest of the media on Sunday. From Lagos, Usman would travel to his home state, Edo, for his community activation plan. “I’m coming home,” an excited Usman said on Instagram, while sharing videos of him and his family at the airport about to take off. “I looked at my passport and realised I hadn’t been home since I was a kid, that’s when I knew it was time.” Kamaru recently defended his title against Jorge Masvidal, knocking the American out in the second round of their meeting to retain his title.
