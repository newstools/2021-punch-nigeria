The Igbo community in Delta State on Monday expressed support for Governor Ifeanyi Okowa over the ban on open grazing across the state, just as they warned jihadists threatening anarchy in the state over the ban to embrace peace. The Eze Ndigbo of Delta Central and Southern Districts, Peter Chukwu, stated this while fielding questions from journalists. He had led a delegation of the Igbo community to the Olu of Warri Palace to pay a condolence visit to the Itsekiris over the transition of the immediate past Olu, His Majesty Ogiame Ikenwoli. Chukwu said the Southern Governors were right to ban open grazing in their domains. He advised that “whoever felt agitated should approach the court of law to seek redress rather than engaging in self-help or anarchy.” He also urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to act as a statesman in his utterances in the face of the raging insecurity in Nigeria “so as not to aggravate tension or give negative signals to his Fulani kinsmen.” “The time we are in calls for open reflection, peace and dialogue, rather than beating war drums”, he added.
