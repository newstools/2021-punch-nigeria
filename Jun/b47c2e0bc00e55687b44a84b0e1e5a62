GUNMEN suspected to be herdsmen in the early hours of Wednesday killed three persons in an attack on Jauro Gantang village in the Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State. A local resident, Mr. Terkimbi Orkurga, told our correspondent on the phone that the attack happened at about 1 am on Wednesday. â€œThe attackers killed a man and his two sons in the attack, while a woman who sustained gunshot wound in the attack is receiving treatment at the First Referral Hospital in Mutum Biyu. The attack came few days after Governor Darius Ishaku ordered that all displaced persons in the recent attacks in Bali and Gassol local government areas should return to their homes unconditionally. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Taraba State Police Command, David Misal, said he had yet to receive report of the attack. However, the Public Relations Officer, Nigeria Immigration Service, Ayuba Tijos, confirmed the attack. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
