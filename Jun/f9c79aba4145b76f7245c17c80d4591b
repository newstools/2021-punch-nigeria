A Lagos-based medical practitioner, Dr. Femi Akinola, has called on Nigerians who have received the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to go for the second dose. Akinola, at the 2021 health and safety week programme of Chemstar Paints Industry Nigeria Limited, said the virus may still continue to ravage the world for the next 10 years before it would finally disappear. “Coronavirus is an unusual virus and it may last the next 10 years before it finally disappears from the world. “So, Nigerians should go for the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as observing all the protocols of regular washing of hands with soap in running water, wearing of face masks and maintaining social or physical distancing,” he said. He recalled how the entire world was locked down in 2020, and some countries are currently locked down due to COVID-19 pandemic. “Vaccination is not really the cause of death or blood clot as being politically insinuated, but how the jab or injection is being administered. The noise characterising the integrity and effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and other COVID-19 vaccines could be attributed to international politics that have been playing out around the world,” Akinola said. The Group Managing Director of the firm, Mr. Adedayo Paseda, lamented the impact of the pandemic on the company’s operations. He said the insecurity level in the country had caused the company a huge loss. The theme of the event was, ‘Safe and Healthy Lifestyle Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic Threats.’ Copyright PUNCH.
