Amid the security challenges in Nigeria, elder statesmen, political and religious leaders on Thursday had a marathon meeting behind closed doors but declined chat with journalists. Those at the meeting in Abuja were former President Olusegun Obasanjo; former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.); the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar; and former Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Diocese, Emeritus John Cardinal Onaiyekan. Others were the President of Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba; former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice,  Kanu Agabi (SAN); General Secretary of Christian Association of Nigeria, Joseph Daramola; Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya and former Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Audu Ogbe. The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi; President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor and leader of Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo were also at the meeting. But journalists who were at the venue were barred from the meeting as the organisers said, “It’s not a media affair.” The meeting, which was convened at the instance of Interfaith Initiatives for Peace, jointly led by the Sultan of Sokoto and  Onaiyekan, was to discuss and find solution to the insecurity threatening the unity and peace of the country. The growing insecurity occasioned by activities of bandits, herdsmen, kidnappers, Boko Haram and secessionist agitations across the country have created tensions among Nigeria and foreigners. Sources however said that the resolutions of the meeting would be presented to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari on Friday (today) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, when participants were expected to meet with the President.
