The Chief Executive Officer, Background Check International, Mr Kola Olugbodi, has urged corporate organisations to avoid losses hindering their growth as a result of lack of background checks and due diligence on their employees. In a statement on Tuesday, he said the issue of background check had become a critical one considering its overall importance to corporate governance. Olugbodi stated that about 70 per cent of organisational loss was due to employees’ sharp practices. He said organisations should stop recruiting based on brilliance and focus on due diligence and background checks. Olugbodi bemoaned the situation where organisations were not conscious about background checks. He said that organisations needed to make background check a corporate culture. “It has become expedient for organisations to embrace background check as a corporate policy issue,” he added. To further re-enforce the core message of instilling background checks as a culture, BCI organised a webinar titled ‘The impact of background check on businesses, now and in the future’, aimed at promoting the overall importance of background checks to corporate existence, the statement said.
