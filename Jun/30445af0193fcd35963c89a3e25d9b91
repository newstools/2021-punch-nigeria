The Lagos State Government says its initiatives in the public service sector are geared towards accelerating innovations across the state in line with Sustainable Development Goals. The Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said this on Wednesday in Alausa, Ikeja, during a press briefing to start the 2021 Public Service Week. The HoS said the programme was meant to highlight the commitment of the present administration towards ensuring a conducive working environment in the state public service through the procurement of adequate tools for ministries, departments and agencies. He said, “Some of the achievements recorded by the Lagos State Public Service in recent years include the professionalisation of Human Resource Management; establishment of the Office of Transformation, Creativity and Innovation, as well as other service institutions, to further entrench the culture of creativity and innovation. “The public service remains the most viable instrument available all over the world for the formulation and implementation of policies and programmes of the government, therefore, public servants should avail themselves of opportunities that the service provides to deepen and expand their knowledge.” Copyright PUNCH.
