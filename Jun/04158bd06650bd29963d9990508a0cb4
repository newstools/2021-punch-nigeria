OYO State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has urged local government chairmen, vice chairmen and heads of local government administration in the state to work with the people and security agencies in order to improve the security situation in their domains. The governor, according to a statement on Wednesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, said the attack on Igangan would have been worse if not for the bravery of the hunters, who challenged the gunmen and repelled them. Makinde said this at the closing of the retreat for chairmen of local government councils in the state. He, however, said the people in the area saw the gunmen grouping during the day but did not alert the government or security agencies of the presence of the strangers there. He said, “When I went to Igangan, I said we would start funding the hunters and local vigilantes and we made the arrangement. Today, I am glad that the HLAs are here. We are passing through a very challenging period. So, everybody must come together to support the initiative. “If we get it right, on a monthly basis, we will ensure that we make provision for them because they are quite important. From the report I have on Ibarapa, both open and confidential, it would have been a lot worse if not for local hunters and vigilantes. So, we need to strengthen that network.” “The number of the security control room is 615. Call it. When there was an issue at Igangan, I didn’t get the report that anyone called the number. It started at about 11:30 pm. Call 615 to address any distressing issue.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
