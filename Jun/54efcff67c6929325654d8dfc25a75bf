AN All Progressives Congress aspirant for the position of National Chairman, Sunny Moniedafe, has said the era of individuals sitting in the comfort of their homes to lord it over party members was coming to an end in the party. He said this at a stakeholders dinner organised for his supporters, in Abuja, on Friday. Moniedafe who was the Federal Capital Territory Chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria, promised to ensure that the choice of the majority of members reign supreme in the selection of candidates to fly the party flag during elections. He said, “We lost about seven states during the last election because some people sat somewhere here to impose candidates on states.” The aspirant promised that when given the chance to steer the ship of the party, he would ensure popular participation in the day to day running of the party at all levels. He said, “My leadership team will ultimately focus on an effective reward to party faithfuls. The political investment, hard work and loyal party members will be given full attention. You will not sow and another will reap.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
