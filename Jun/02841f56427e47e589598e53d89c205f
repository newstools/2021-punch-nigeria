The Athletics Federation of Nigeria has announced the commencement of sales of nomination forms for its election slated for June 14 in Kebbi State. Secretary of the AFN electoral committee, Siminialayi Pepple, announced the release of electoral guidelines and sales of nomination forms in a statement on Wednesday. The statement said aspirants who wanted to contest in the election should visit the AFN website to download and fill the form. The electoral committee directed that completed forms must be submitted not later than June 12. “The President, the first and second Vice Presidents shall be elected by Congress, while the Zonal Representatives shall be elected by their respective zones, under the supervision of the Electoral Committee. One of the Vice Presidents shall be a female,” part of the statement read. The AFN had been in crisis for over one year, with a faction led by duly elected president, Ibrahim Gusau, while vice president, Olamide George, heads the splinter group, which has the backing of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development. After meeting with both camps, World Athletics and Confederation of African Athletics mandated the Gusau-led board to conduct elections not later than June 14. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
