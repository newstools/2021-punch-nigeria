Some international airlines have adopted the trend of issuing a handwritten boarding passes to their passengers. Our correspondent gathered that some of the airlines who have now joined the band of those issuing out handwritten boarding passes are Rwanda Air and Egypt Air. A passenger (name withheld), who boarded a flight from Nigeria to Rwanda using Rwand Air recently confirmed to our correspondent that she was given a handwritten boarding pass. Similarly, another passenger who experienced the same thing was on a flight to Egypt from Nigeria. Though no official explanation has been given for this development, passengers who spoke with our correspondent suggested that it could have been due to technical issues or the airlines had run out of ink. Spokesperson for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Samuel Adurogboye, said airlines sometimes issued handwritten boarding passes under various circumstances, including technical issues and breakdown of systems. He added that airlines might resort to issuing handwritten boarding passes in order not to delay their air passengers. A Nigerian lady had last year called out one of the Nigerian airlines for issuing her a handwritten boarding pass after rescheduling her flight twice. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
