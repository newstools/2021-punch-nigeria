The Federal Government through the National Malaria Elimination Programme has partnered stakeholders in the health sector to fight malaria in the country. The National Coordinator of NMEP, Dr Perpetua Uhomoibhi, in a statement on Thursday, said concerted effort was needed to win the war against malaria. She said, “The National Malaria Elimination Programme has made efforts in reducing morbidity and mortality rate due to malaria in the country through malaria vector control interventions, and a lot of milestones have been achieved through several interventions. Similarly, other disease vectors such as flies, bugs, fleas and cockroaches are being controlled in the country. “In a bid to reinforce these efforts, the National Malaria Elimination Programme, Public Health Department, Federal Ministry of Health in collaboration with Olomitutu Kalt Limited is commencing a pilot trial of Aragon Insecticide for Malaria Vector Control in Nigeria. The trial is an open-label, controlled, multiple application, multicentre design to take place in Ebonyi and Niger states of Nigeria.” Uhomoibhi noted that the objectives of the trial included the gathering of baseline information with respect to species composition, relative abundance, room resting density, human biting rate, and feeding status. Other objectives, according to her, were to determine the insecticidal efficacy of Aragon as an aerosol spray against malaria vectors in the selected communities and to determine the peoples’ perception and acceptability of Aragon insecticide for malaria vector control.
