A non-governmental organisation, Touchme Foundation, said it will support efforts at tackling insecurity in Nigeria by giving free education to some underprivileged children in public schools. The president and founder of the non-governmental organisation, Ademuyiwa Oduwole, in an interview with our correspondent on Thursday said the bandits, insurgents and other criminally minded people usually recruit illiterate teenagers from rural areas because of their vulnerability. He said the goal of his group was to assist in tackling the problem of poverty and illiteracy by providing welfare and basic education for the underprivileged. Oduwole, who said the group, founded in March 23, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, had reached out to many internally displaced persons camped in various places in the Federal Capital Territory. He said, “We will unveil a special fund tagged, ‘Save a Child Education,’ which is a free primary education programme for children to be enrolled in government primary schools across the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
