A former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi, has congratulated the immediate past president and Chief Executive Officer of Transcorps, Valentine Ozigbo, on emerging the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the November 6 poll in Anambra State. Ozigbo was elected candidate of the party in a primary election held by a faction of PDP at Prof Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre on Saturday. Another faction of the party had elected Senator Ugochukwu Uba as the candidate of the same party at Paul University playground. While congratulating Ozigbo on his victory in the primary, Obi said that the election had come to an end. He commended the other contestants that participated in the election for their hard work and sacrifices. He called on them not to see the conclusion of the gubernatorial primaries “as the end of the beginning, but rather the beginning of the end.” Obi says, “I thank the National Chairman who, together with his leadership, has remained neutral. I congratulate the PDP family in Anambra state who has given the state the most peaceful and organised process of choosing a candidate.” He called on the PDP in the state and beyond to pull together as a family towards what he described as “a journey of building a better Anambra State for the future of our children and the true “light of the nation.”
