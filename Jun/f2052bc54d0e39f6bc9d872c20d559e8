As a way of encouraging productivity, the management of the Federal Polytechnic, Auchi, Edo State, has promoted 283 academic and non-academic staff, while 63 got approval for further studies within and outside the country. The acting Rector of the polytechnic, Engr. Mustaphar Zubair, told journalists in Auchi On Monday that the welfare of the institution’s workers remained paramount and key in achieving maximum output. He said, “Workers’ welfare has remained one of our priorities. No fewer than 283 staff were promoted recently. We also create comfort for staff through the renovation of their buildings, making water available by drilling boreholes in their quarters. Zubair noted that the further studies of 63 lecturers would be done under the Tertiary Education Trust Fund academic training development. “In the last council meeting, we considered study leave for 63 of our lecturers. Once they apply and qualify, we process their application and if it is approved by TETFUND, their money is released, Zubair said.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
