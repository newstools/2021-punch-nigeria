Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, will join other dignitaries at a two-day training for Nigerian negotiators, organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission. The spokesperson for the ICPC, Mrs Azuka Ogugua, in a statement on Sunday, said the training scheduled to begin on Monday (today), would have in attendance Melaku Desta, a Professor of International Economic Law from the Leicester De Montfort University in the United Kingdom. “The training is being organised by ICPC in conjunction with the Inter-Agency Committee on Stopping Illicit Financial Flows from Nigeria. Participants for the training are senior and middle-level negotiators drawn from Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the government, who are involved in negotiating trade agreements with foreign nations and companies for Nigeria. “Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, will give an opening address at the capacity building for the Nigerian negotiators while Prof. Desta will deliver a paper on ‘Understanding Trade Agreements.’ The ICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, SAN, in the statement said, “The idea of the training is to sensitise negotiators on the type of clauses to look out for to protect the laws of the country and prevent Nigeria from losing revenue through Illicit Financial Flows. “The training will help our negotiators prepare for the risks associated with negotiating trade, investment, tax, natural resource, and environmental agreements for the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
