Former Real Madrid B midfielder Mutiu Adepoju has hailed David Alaba’s move from Bayern Munich to the Spanish giants, but added that the Austrian of Nigerian descent will be highly missed at the Allianz Arena. Alaba will join Real Madrid on July 1 after he signed a five-year contract The defender left Bayern this summer after spending his entire professional career playing for the Rekordmeister. In an interview with Daily Mail, the 29-year-old opened up on his decision to join Los Blancos. “I have my thoughts, and Real Madrid was top of my list, so I decided to go there. “It (transfer speculation) is motivation. Motivation for all the players who are linked with certain teams in the Premier League or other clubs. They can represent themselves here at this tournament so it’s extra motivation actually rather than a distraction.” Alaba’s contract renegotiation talks will go down as one of the worst in Bayern’s history and Adepoju, while speaking with The PUNCH, said the defender would be greatly missed by the Germans. “Alaba is a great player and he had served Bayern for many years while he was young. “He wants a change of environment and a new challenge and he opted for Madrid who are one of the greatest clubs in the world. These things happen in football as we all see Sergio Ramos also leaving for free. “Though they (Bayern) never wanted him to leave, they can’t force him to stay. I can bet that they will definitely miss him because he is a great player and Madrid just made one of the biggest signings in football.” Alaba’s Austria crashed out of the ongoing Euro 2020 championship on Saturday following a 2-1 defeat to Italy.
