A former Commissioner for Oil and Gas in Edo State, Joseph Ikpea, escaped abduction after gunmen reportedly attacked his convoy on Sunday along the Igbanke/Agbor Road, close to a boundary community separating Edo and Delta states. Ikpea told The PUNCH that the attack occurred while he was returning from his hometown, Ewatto, where he had gone to attend the Ojirua of Irrua 50th Coronation Anniversary on Saturday, where he was also honoured. He said, “I was sleeping when the incident occurred, but according to my personal assistant and the escort, the attackers were between eight and 12 in number with black uniform and bulletproof jackets. Surprisingly, they carried out the attack at a regular police checkpoint. However, the policemen, who were supposed to be at that checkpoint, came a few minutes later from where they had gone to eat.” The President of the Esan Youths Organisation, Kingsley Ohens, advised the government to engage vigilantes in combating kidnappers and hoodlums.
