The Federal Capital Territory Authority on Thursday confirmed the death of seven people from cholera outbreak in the territory. The Acting Secretary, FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat, Dr Mohammed Kawu, disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja. He said 91 suspected cases had so far been recorded, adding that seven deaths were recorded at the Wassa community (Internally Displaced Persons’ camp) in the Abuja Municipal Area Council. According to Kawu, no death has been reported in Bwari and Gwagwalada area councils. He said the FCT began to receive reports of sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in some communities in May 2021. The acting secretary said the FCT’s health secretariat, through the Department of Public Health, had intensified surveillance in the communities and health facilities and also directed the area councils to do the same.
