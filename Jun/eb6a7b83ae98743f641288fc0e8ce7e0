A section of the Umuahia Timber Market along Ahiaeke Road in Abia State has been set ablaze by angry traders. This was after vigilantes tried to enforce the payment of N18,000 annual levy imposed by the Abia State Internal Revenue Board. The vigilantes who had tried to close the shops of those who failed to pay the levy were resisted by the traders who angrily set ablaze the office of the local guards in the market. This was after one of the traders identified as Indomie was shot dead and five others injured. Vehicles were also torched during the confusion that ensued at the market. Reacting, the Secretary to the State Government, Chris Ezem, condemned the incident and ordered for it to be investigated. He said in a statement, “The impunity of burning buildings and other public institutions must stop forthwith, as arson remains a very serious crime against the state and humanity, which attracts severe consequences under our laws. “Government will promptly discipline any Abia Vigilante Service personnel who harasses or intimidates citizens.”
