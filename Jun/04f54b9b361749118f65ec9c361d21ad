A 2021 cost-of-living survey by consultancy firm Mercer, has named Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, as the world’s most expensive city for foreign workers. The annual survey, in determining its results, evaluated the cost of more than 200 goods and services, including the price of housing, food, and transportation. It also considered factors such as currency fluctuation, cost inflation, etc. The annual survey claims as its purpose, helping governments and companies across the world with the means of determining how much they should pay foreign workers. “This survey provides key insights for employers, employees, governments and city authorities looking to improve their attractiveness to entice foreign talent, businesses and investments.” Last year, Ashgabat was ranked second on Mercer’s list of most expensive cities to live in, beaten by Hong Kong. Hong Kong and most countries in the top 10 earned their rank on account of them being viable economic hubs, a condition that naturally led to a hike in the price of housing and general cost of living in these cities. In Ashgabat’s case, its high ranking is as a result of economic depression and “high local inflation” as described by Jean-Philippe Sarra of Mercer. Another reason for Ashgabat’s economic troubles may be traced to Turkmenistan’s dependence on natural gas exports for revenue, a national cash cow that has since taken a hit due to global low gas prices, leading to hyper-inflation in the Central Asian country. Ashgabat’s move to first place may also be as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which a report by Human Rights Watch said has “drastically exacerbated Turkmenistan’s pre-existing food crisis”. Some other cities in the top 10 include Beirut, Zurich, Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore. Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, was ranked as the least expensive city for expatriates.
