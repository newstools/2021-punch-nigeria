A woman, Joke Olaniji, has been found dead on a cocoa farm in the Ondo East Local Government Area of Ondo State, two weeks after she was declared missing. The 55-year-old woman was said to have left home two weeks ago without telling anybody where she was going. The deceased’s mother, Juliana, said she thought her daughter went out to buy something when she (mother) returned home from a meeting and did not find her at home. She said, “Around 3.30pm when I was coming from the meeting, I saw somebody coming out of our house. She told me that she could not find Joke in the house, as she wanted to buy nylon. “I became worried and quickly ran home to call people to help me look for my daughter because she went out in the morning without telling me where she was going. “When we could not trace her, we informed the police and went to other places to pray so that she could come home. But we did not see her until the police called that her body was found naked on a cocoa farm very close to our area.” The distraught mother appealed to the police to unravel what happened to her daughter and arrest the perpetrators. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident, adding that the deceased had since been buried. He also said investigation into the matter had begun.
