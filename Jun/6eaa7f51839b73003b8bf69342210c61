You are probably one of the Nigerians who laughed their heads off on Tuesday when water poured from the leaky roof of the White House complex of the National Assembly during a downpour? Well, you have to know that the joke is actually not in the incident but the situations that continue to expose the absurdity in the self-styled giant of Africa. The laughs are in order no doubt especially given the huge wastage that dots every sector yet everywhere is in shambles. The cleaners at the complex must have had a rough day scooping water from the floor of the assembly. Eavesdropper can only urge them to endure after all Nigeria is their country.  It is not easy to be in the National Assembly and see the beautiful things that make the country wonderful. But it is good to advise that big bowls should be kept in case the downpour goes beyond what they envisage next time. You probably must have also read the defence about the N37bn included in the Federal Capital Development Agency budget for the renovation of the 27-year-old edifice. No be Nigeria, there is always a response for everything even when the best thing is to apologise for an event and take a lesson from it. Eavesdropper is thinking that perhaps until that money is put into action, the complex may continue to endure a leaky roof. The day work starts on the assembly is the exact day the leaky roof would be fixed. Abi? Rains continue falling jare, at least N37bn is being awaited and you can take over the entire complex through the irritating leaky roof until N37bn is put into action. Shebi a leaky roof cannot be fixed temporarily until N37bn comes into action. To even believe that many people are not even particular about representation going on in the country. Yet, all Nigerians hear are funny figures all over the place. Well, visitors to the assembly should go and look for cardigans and change-over clothes in case they are within the complex and a leaky roof collects rain water to decorate their bodies. Going down memory lane, in 2019, during a United Kingdom’s House of Commons debate, sitting was suspended as water poured through a ceiling into the chamber. Lawmakers were asked to vacate the chamber and journalists also had no choice than to follow suit as the water glided to the press gallery. But before the incident, experts had warned for years that the iconic parliament building needed urgent repairs. The constant pipe burst and fragmented brickwork were enough signs. Some things Eavesdropper hears in Nigeria and feels that ‘can this be real?’ Yes, it is real. The truth is that there is nothing new in Nigeria and you should not try to argue it. This is because when what you don’t believe can happen in the country eventually occurs, rather than to quickly end it to avoid global shame, it will become a seasonal film. Be wary of those cookies What is really making some people sell drugged cookies and biscuits to unsuspecting members of society? The recent arrest of a medical doctor by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has again caused worry especially as the cookies were said to have been laced with cannabis sativa. The implication of that on the health of consumers cannot be quantified but then the reason behind the action needs to be proven beyond doubt. Eavesdropper wonders if the maker thinks of the effect on a child if such is unknowingly given to such a child.  In April this year, the agency nabbed an undergraduate and her boyfriend who were selling drug cookies to schoolchildren and unwary members of the public.  The dust had yet to settle over that when two sisters were arrested the following month by the agency for trading in drugged cookies online. The online drug cartel sells drugged cookies, cakes, brownies and other illicit substances to residents of Abuja and beyond. The motive behind the business though sketchy showed that the cartels were hell-bent on carrying out the nefarious activities. This is more so because after some of them had been arrested, they continue with the trade. It should be noted that if the makers don’t have regular and willing customers, the trade will not continue to thrive. Basically, reports show that those arrested operated the business online. It’s clear that people continue to initiate new ways to take prying eyes away from their criminal act. One of the suspects was said to have confessed that she had many customers who ordered the drug-laced cookies, brownies and edibles on a daily basis for parties and ceremonies in and outside Abuja. But beyond the established customers, it’s clear that it’s also being introduced to unsuspecting members of the public to boost patronage.
