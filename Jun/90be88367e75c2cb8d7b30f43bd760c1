Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested two suspected cultists for allegedly unleashing mayhem in the Orelope area of Ilogbo Ota, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government area of the state. The suspects, Jamiu Okanlawon, 20; and Oluwaseun Owoeye, 30, were arrested on Sunday while two rival cults engaged in a supremacy battle. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. Oyeyemi said the suspects were arrested following a distress call received by the Divisional Police Officer, Onipanu Division, CSP Bamidele Job, that suspected cultists were on the rampage and making lives difficult for innocent members of the public. He stated, “Upon the distress call, the DPO mobilised his men, in collaboration with local vigilantes, and stormed the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the hoodlums, who had already inflicted varying degrees of injury on the duo of 45-year-old Modinat Lawal and Ope Saheed, took to flight, but two among them were apprehended, while the others escaped. “Recovered from them are one locally-fabricated single-barrelled pistol, three live cartridges, one dagger casing and assorted charms. “The two injured persons were taken to hospital by the police for urgent medical treatment.” The PPRO added that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the transfer of the suspects to the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation. “The CP also reiterated that the war against cultism in the state is a continuous one and the command will not rest until the vice is completely eradicated in all parts of the state,” Oyeyemi stated.
