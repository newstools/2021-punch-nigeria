THE President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), will on Thursday (today) pay a one-day official visit to Lagos State. During the visit, Buhari is expected to inaugurate two projects under the Ministry of Transportation. He is expected to first inaugurate the commercial operation of the Lagos-Ibadan Rail line. The event is scheduled to take place at the Mobolaji Johnson Railway Station, Ebute Metta Junction at 10am. From there, the President and members of his entourage will proceed to ENL Terminal, Apapa, where he is scheduled to inaugurate the Integrated National Maritime Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure (Deep Blue Assets). Buhari is expected to be received at the Presidential Wing of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; and the Minister of State for Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, among other top government officials. He will thereafter proceed directly to Ebute Metta after the airport arrival formalities. It is expected that some major roads in Lagos will be closed to traffic during the Presidentâ€™s visit. Buhari is expected to return to Abuja immediately after the two events. Ahead of the inauguration of the Deep Blue Assets, the Maritime Security Unit of the Deep Blue Project, comprising personnel from the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air Force, Nigeria Police Force, and Department of State Services, have been conducting simulation exercises for the event on the land, air, and sea assets of the project to confirm their readiness for full deployment.
