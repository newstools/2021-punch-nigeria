THE Ogun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Thursday, staged a protest against the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission, accusing it of meddling in the party’s internal affairs. State Chairman of the party, Sikirulahi Ogundele, leveled the allegation while leading a group of protesting members to the state Secretariat of the Nigeria Union Journalists, Oke-Ilewo, Abeokuta. Ogundele told reporters that the state electoral management body had renewed its attempt to unjustifiably meddle in the internal affairs of the PDP with respect to the forthcoming Local Government Council elections. He was responding to reports that the OGSIEC handed forms meant for the PDP to a faction of the party without the knowledge or consent of the authentic leadership. Ogundele said, “We are very disturbed that, without any shade of doubts, OGSIEC is obviously acting on a script as written by the ruling APC government which is bent on avoiding healthy political competition which the forthcoming local government election presents. “There is no form of crisis, rancour or disagreement in the party any longer.” He, however, accused OGSIEC of trying to resuscitate a dispute that had long been settled. He vowed to seek legal redress should the electoral body reject the list of candidates forwarded to it by the party leadership. In response, the OGSIEC Chairman Babatunde Osibodu said, “The Commission granted audience to all the factions but will however follow the counsel of legal experts before taking final decisions. OGSIEC has received a document from the aggrieved faction’s Lawyer and it will be dealing with that lawyer.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
