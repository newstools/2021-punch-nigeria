Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has assured that the stadium ban imposed by the Federal Government and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 will be lifted soon, The PUNCH reports. Dare made this known on Tuesday during his visit to the Super Eagles B camp in Abuja, where they are preparing for Sunday’s international friendly against Mexico in the United States. “We hope to see our fans back in the stadiums soon as soon as we establish very strict COVID-19 protocols,” Dare said. “We’ll see what we can do about that. The fans are very important to the game, so we shall monitor the situation and work with the relevant agencies to actualise this.” After nine months of lockdown, domestic football came back to life in Nigeria as restrictions imposed on contact sports, especially football, were lifted by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. However, fans were banned from attending matches at the venues. This has, however, not been adhered to by fans, who throng match venues in their numbers, with some causing violent scenes in recent games across the country. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
