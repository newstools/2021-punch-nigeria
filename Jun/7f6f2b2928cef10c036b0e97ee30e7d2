The death of the renowned televangelist and founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet Temitope Joshua, came as a rude shock to Nigerians and many other people around the world. The cleric synonymous with miracles died at the age of 57 after a ministration on Saturday, according to a statement on Sunday by his church. “God has taken His servant Prophet TB Joshua home – as it should be by divine will. His last moments on earth were spent in the service of God. This is what he was born for, lived for and died for,” the statement partly read. Joshua, who was born on June 12, 1963, had planned to celebrate his 58th birthday on June 12, 2021 with fasting and prayer. In a message posted on his Facebook page on Friday, he had said, “Viewers all over the world, June 12th is around the corner. As you know, I am a man of the people. So, the wound of one is the wound of all. “As things stand, you may have realised it will not be easy for me to celebrate my birthday under the present circumstances. Some of the people who want to come are troubled by the situation all over the world. We see their fear and their worry. I feel their pain; I feel their worry. “Therefore, let us dedicate this day to prayer and fasting. Don’t forget the needy. By the grace of God, more birthdays are ahead. God bless you! Emmanuel. Jesus is Lord! Happy Birthday!”
