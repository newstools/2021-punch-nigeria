Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, and a former Commissioner for Tertiary Education, Abdullahi Alikinla, have disagreed over the completion of an auditorium in the state polytechnic. AbdulRazaq had on Friday unveiled the auditorium which was initiated by the late former Governor, Muhammed Lawal. The completion of the edifice came about 20 years after the late governor laid the foundation of the auditorium. Governor AbdulRazaq, at the unveiling ceremony, maintained that his administration would continue to play development politics on the completion of abandoned projects in the state. He said, “The construction of this auditorium started over 19 years ago. It got stalled on the altar of politics of who conceived what. In 2019, I pledged not to let Kwara be a mortuary of abandoned projects. The unveiling of this facility is, therefore, a fulfilment of that pledge.” “As we have funded this auditorium to a befitting completion, projects like the Osi and Ilesha Baruba campuses of Kwara State University, which we inherited, will be funded to completion. This is developmental politics.” Alikinla, however, disputed claims that the project was completed by the present administration saying it was the last administration under former Governor Abdulfattah Ahmed, that completed the project. “The project was started by the late Governor Lawal but completed by the last administration under my ministry. Former Governor Abdulfattah Ahmed, was even supposed to unveil the project before he left.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
