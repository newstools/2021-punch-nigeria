Popular comedienne, Emanuella Samuel, has debunked rumours of her pregnancy. She posted a video on her Instagram account on Tuesday, featuring herself and security operatives, to which a fan, @official_emmolak commented, “I can’t see the belle o.” Shooting down the rumour, Emanuella replied light-heartedly with laughing emojis. “I am not pregnant as you can see, that must have been a rumour if you heard so.” The skit maker who was named the Top Subscribed Youtube Creator in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, made her debut comedy skit on YouTube at the tender age of five. Within five years, Emanuella has built an army of admirers and fans, most of whom did not take likely the comment by a fan of her rumoured pregnancy. An Instagram user, @Princeajoel, said, “Such question is absurd for someone at her tender age.” Another fan, @Avarion19, wrote, “Why would you even ask her that kind of question in the first place?.” Also, @Officialebuka, while slamming the commenter, wrote, “Really, you don’t have shame, asking such question openly for someone this young.” Emanuella continues to build an amazing career in comedy even while in secondary school. In a recent interview, the Imo native revealed that she made both commitments work by reserving comedy shoots and travelling till after school days. “I always travel on weekends or holidays, not during school time. I don’t shoot during school periods,” she said.
