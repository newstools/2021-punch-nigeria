Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed worry over the growing level of unemployment  relating to fresh graduates in the country. Osinbajo stated that the government was concerned and would ensure that the challenge was tackled. He said, “Unemployment is a great problem, especially youth unemployment. Two million young people come to the job market every year. “We absolutely must create good paying jobs, and create opportunities for these young people. This is a task complicated by numerous employability issues including a mismatch and job losses as a result of digitalisation.” The Vice-President, who spoke on Wednesday during a virtual meeting organised by Federal Government and United Nations Development Programme, added that no fewer than 20,000 graduates would be employed under the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows programme. He said the programme, which is targeted at graduates, would create internship opportunities and empower Nigerian youths with skills and capacity. “The programme is for those, who have recently concluded the youth service. These are fully paid intensive training that will last 12 months,” Osinbajo added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
