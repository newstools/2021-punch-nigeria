Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has urged Nigerians to be more determined in ensuring that democracy works in the country. He said this in a goodwill message commemorating the 2021 Democracy Day titled ‘Democracy day: Fayemi felicitates with Nigerians’, on Saturday. Fayemi said “despite its imperfection, democracy remains the best option for the country”, adding that “through the determination of the citizens and their active participation in the democratic process, Nigerians can achieve a truly great country of their dream”. The Governor urged Nigerians not to relent in their search for lasting peace as a necessary condition for progress and prosperity. Fayemi saluted the heroic deeds of patriots, who worked assiduously to actualise democratic rule in the country, especially the symbol of the June 12 struggle, the late Chief M.K.O. Abiola, saying only a truly great, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria could be a befitting compensation for their sacrifices. Stressing that democracy is a journey and not a destination, Governor Fayemi said a lot more sacrifice was required from the citizens to ensure the country gets the best out of its democratic rule. He urged the youth especially, to show more interest in the economic and political development of the country, adding that they have the required education, exposure, and numerical strength to make positive impact on both the economy and governance. “We may not have reached the promised land, but we have left Egypt. We may not have attained the best, but we surely have made some progress as a nation. “With more determination and active participation of the citizens in the democratic process, we would reach the promised land. “While we remember today the contributions and sacrifices of our patriots (dead and living), the only befitting compensation for their efforts would be a truly great, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria. This is achievable,” he added.
