Tears flowed freely on Sunday as members of the Synagogue Church of All Nations gathered on the churchâ€™s premises to mourn the death of their General Overseer, Temitope Joshua. The church road was crowded with people who were prevented from entering the church. Men and women wailed uncontrollably as others laid their hands on their heads in utter shock and disbelief. The worshippers sang and cried as others paid tributes to the good works of the church leader who died on Saturday. TB Joshua had announced in a video on Friday that he would not celebrate his 58th birthday slated for June 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
