The Ekiti State Government on Thursday urged coordinating principals of secondary schools in Ekiti State to work towards ensuring that students in public schools in the state record a minimum of 85 per cent success in certificate examinations. The Executive Secretary of the state Teaching Service Commission, Mr Alani Daramola, said the charge was to justify government’s investment in the education sector. Daramola, who spoke in Ado Ekiti at a meeting with the principals in the 16 Local Government Areas, also urged them to ensure that teachers concentrate more on certificate classes and the key subjects. “Deploy every success attainment strategy devoid of examination malpractices for the certificate classes comprising Senior Secondary School three and Junior Secondary School three, including the use of past questions and marking schemes by WAEC and NECO to teach these certificate classes,” he said. Daramola added that TESCOM would sensitise the students on the need for them to be diligent and attend classes regularly and punctually while officials from the commission would visit the schools to monitor activities of the students and teachers.
