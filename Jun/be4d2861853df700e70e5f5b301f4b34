Members of the family of Ramon Azeez, the 36-year-old man killed during the attack on the Iwo Road Shopping Complex, Ibadan, have cried out over what they called ‘threats to their lives’. The elder brother of the deceased, Ahmed Azeez, on Tuesday, told our correspondent in Ibadan that those who killed his brother were still threatening to kill him. He said, “My life is being threatened. I was their target during the attack but I was lucky to have escaped being killed. “They killed my brother, looted our shops, and destroyed so many things yet they are not satisfied. They are threatening my life. “We are mourning my brother and they didn’t even want us to mourn in peace. Can you see now? I don’t know what they really want. Do they want to take over the shopping complex or kill us?” Ahmed had said on Friday that he was the real target of the hoodlums who killed his brother. He said the killing of his brother was a very unfortunate incident that had left him and his mother traumatised. A close neighbour of the grieving family, Khamil Omotoso, also corroborated Azeez’s claim. He said, “We need protection. Government should protect the family. We have been receiving threats on the phone and this is strange.” Recall that the mayhem started following an altercation between Ahmed and an official of the Park Management System over the allegation of blocking the entrance to the shopping complex by vehicles. The altercation degenerated and hoodlums attacked the shopping complex where they killed Rahmon, who was said to have recently got a visa to visit the United States to see his wife and newborn twins.
