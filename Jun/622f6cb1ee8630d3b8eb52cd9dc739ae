A member of the Aviation Safety Round Table, Olumide Ohunayo, has called for transparency in the Nigerian aviation sector. Ohunayo, an aviation analyst and Assistant Secretary of ART, in his presentation at the Airport Business Summit, said “I would like to see transparency and corporate governance from the top down. You cannot measure what you cannot see either. “Partnership between the private and public sector is not just related to projects or privatisation but requires all stakeholders to get on the same page. “The big data era has given the aviation sector the tools required to do both. Therefore, the industry must rise and work towards having appropriate, veritable and generally acceptable data for the industry to attract investors, reduce cost and improve revenue.” While noting the N27bn allocated to the aviation sector by the Federal Government, he said the ministry allocated N5bn to some segments of the sector while keeping a chunk of the palliatives for the proposed national carrier. He said, “Subsequently, scheduled operators were granted N3bn with five per cent deductions for the agencies, non-scheduled operators N1bn with a total deduction of N950.10m to aviation agencies, and ground handling companies got N233.33m each. “The National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies received a total of N196m with N4m deductions, while the Airport Car Hire Association of Nigeria received N100m from the ministry.” He said although Nigeria adopted the US model of supporting payroll and assisting different organisations, it did not adopt or include the necessary caveat to monitor usage, implementation and the provision of other non-cash palliatives.
