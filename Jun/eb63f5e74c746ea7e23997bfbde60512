THE management of Kaduna State University on Tuesday announced the indefinite suspension of academic activities in the institution. The Register of the university, Samuel Manshop, who made the announcement, however, exempted Postgraduate programmes, College of Medicines, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Part-time programmes from the suspension. This was contained in a special bulletin of the school titled, ‘Indefinite suspension of academic activities in KASU for undergraduate students.’ It read, “The management of Kaduna State University wishes to notify staff, students and the general public that academic activities for undergraduate students have been suspended indefinitely. “Postgraduate programmes, College of Medicines, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Part-time programmes are to continue with their activities. Members of staff are also expected to report to work as usual.” The suspension followed the protest by the students of the school over hike in tuition fees by the state government. The state Deputy Governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, had last Wednesday said the tuition fees increment was painful but necessary, noting that “it is the only way the institution can stay afloat.” Balarabe had also claimed that the state government was spending about N5bn on KASU as the N26,000 that students were paying was not enough to pay lecturers for three months.
