The US Mission in Nigeria has warned the public of fake websites and messages advertising US Visa lottery. One of such messages spreading on Whatsapp said, “Take the chance of living in the USA and apply for the official US Green Card Lottery. “The Green Card unlocks the door to the United States for thousands of USA fans every year. It allows the lucky Green Card winners permanent residence as well as an unlimited work permit for the USA. “Every year, the United States grants 55,000 Green Cards through the Green Card Lottery!” Describing the message and others as fake, the US Mission in Nigeria stated that information on the visa lottery can only be found on websites it shared on Twitter. “The US Mission to Nigeria is aware of websites and messages advertising the U.S. visa lottery. All of these sites are FAKE!” the US Mission tweeted. “Addresses that have a .gov are the only accurate source of visa information,” the tweet added.
