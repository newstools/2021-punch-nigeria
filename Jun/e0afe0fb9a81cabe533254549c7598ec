The Special Adviser to Governor Ben Ayade on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Rt Hon Mark Bukie Obi has turned in his resignation letter after refusing to defect with the governor from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. In his letter dated June 7, 2021 to the governor titled ‘Your Excellency, RESIGNATION FROM OFFICE OF SPECIAL ADVISER,’ Obi said, “Following recent happenings in the political alignment of the State Governor, I am persuaded to review my involvement in the current state administration. “Consequently, being a founding and subsisting member of the Peoples Democratic Party in Cross River State, I cannot in good conscience remain in my current appointment as Special Adviser. “I hereby resign my appointment as Special Adviser effective immediately. I am grateful to Your Excellency for finding me worthy to serve the state in the said capacity. Nevertheless, I will continue to support the state and government in any way possible as a stakeholder and senior citizen. “Please accept my best regards.” Some commissioners have been relieved of their appointments for refusing to defect to the APC along with Governor Ayade. The governor’s defection on Thursday, May 20 has thrown up a lot of issues, one of which is the controversial acquisition of the PDP state secretariat by the APC.
