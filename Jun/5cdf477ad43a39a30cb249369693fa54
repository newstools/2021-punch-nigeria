Inaugurating the 11-man committee in Abuja, the Minister of Education,  Adamu Adamu, lauded the Tertiary Education Trust Fund for coming up with the NRDF initiative. Adamu, who was represented  by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono,  said the committee would undertake one of the most important and meaningful assignments on behalf of the ministry and the country as a whole. “The task of preparing a draft Executive bill is not an ordinary job. It requires the best to do it and that is why some of our best and tested lawyers, academics and industry leaders have been called upon to do this assignment,” he said. While calling on members of the committee to live up to expectations in carrying out the assignment, the minister said boosting efforts in research and development holds the key that will redefine the nation’s path to a knowledge economy. The minister said the committee, which is chaired by Prof. Auwal Yadudu, had four weeks to complete its assignment and produce a report to be considered by the Ministry for” transmission to the Federal Executive Council and expectedly, the National Assembly, that is to approve the bill for presidential assent.” Earlier, the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Prof. Suleiman Bogoro, said the nation’s intellectuals must take up its responsibility by promoting ideas that would fast-track the development of Nigeria, particularly in the area of Research and Development.
