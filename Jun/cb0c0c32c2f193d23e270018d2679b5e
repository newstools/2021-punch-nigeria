Polaris Bank says it has introduced a new reward initiative, tagged ‘Refer & Win’, for existing and new users of the bank’s digital banking platform, VULTe. The bank said this in a statement on Wednesday titled ‘Polaris Bank launches ‘Refer & Win’ reward for VULTe users’. According to the statement, users have the chance to win up to N1,300 instant cash reward each time they refer someone who opens an account and enrolls on the newly-launched digital solution. It said, “To benefit from the reward initiative, all a referrer (who could be an existing customer or non-customer of the bank) needs to do is to refer a new user to open a Polaris Bank account by enrolling on the VULTe digital bank platform. “For every referral completed, both the referrer and referred’s account will be credited with N300 and N200 respectively, instantly.” The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Polaris Bank, Mr Innocent Ike, said the referral campaign was aimed at positioning VULTe as a unique digital solution to reward both the existing and new customers of the bank. He said, “VULTe stands out as a very unique innovative digital bank platform in many respects. It not only provides users unique offerings as a self-service solution, it also offers convenience, speed and reliability on the go. “The referral campaign aligns with our bank’s commitment to provide new experience and easier accessibility to banking services for all customers, and to reward them for their continued loyalty.” The Chief Digital Officer, Polaris Bank, Mr Dele Adeyinka, while explaining the mechanics for participating in the reward exercise, said participants were required to enroll, fetch their referral code from VULTe and share with prospects.
