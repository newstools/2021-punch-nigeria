Some Nigerians on social media have slammed some Northern groups for placing a bounty on the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. The PUNCH had earlier reported that a coalition of 75 Northern groups under the aegis of the Northern Consensus Movement placed a N100 million reward for anybody who could produce Kanu, for him to be tried over alleged treason. The NCM specifically accused Kanu and IPOB militant wing, Eastern Security Network of masterminding the recent spate of attacks on Northern communities in the South-East. This claim did not go well with some Nigerians as they have taken to Facebook to slam NCM, asking the group to place bounty on Boko Haram and bandits instead. A Facebook user, Oyebode Funmilayo, wrote, “How much did they place on their bandits and terrorists’ kinsmen disturbing the peace of the Northern region? Charity begins at home. You shouldn’t love your neighbours more than yourself. They should channel their energy and resources to fight insurgency, terrorism, banditry and kidnapping in the North.” Another user, Olanrewaju Olubayo, wrote, “The same groups that have remained quiet over Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram and bandits menace in the North are placing a bounty on Nnamdi Kanu, a business that obviously isn’t theirs. God have mercy on a failing country!” “How much have they placed on bandits, Boko Haram, herdsmen and the criminal elements disturbing the peace of the people in the North?” Obigbesan Olufemi asked. “All the mass kidnappings going on in the North is all about fundraising to enable them place N100m bounty. Anyway, the bounty is too small I suggest they increase it,” Godsgift Christopher mocked. Hannah Samuel, wrote, “Of all the problems ravaging the North, it’s Nnamdi Kanu that’s their major headache. Northerners need deliverance!” Solarin Olusegun asked, “What bounty are you going to place on bandit leaders who have been killing mercilessly and robbing people of their hard-earned money?
