Officials and players of the Super Eagles will on Tuesday (today) undergo COVID-19 screening in Abuja as they prepare to depart the country for their friendly fixture against Mexico in the US. The team’s media officer, Babafemi Raji, confirmed this on Monday. Nigeria are billed to face Mexico in California on July 3. The Mexicans are using the match as their final warm-up game before proceeding to the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the USA. Speaking to NFF media, Enyimba’s enterprising winger, Anayo Iwuala, said the players, all home-based, had what it took to put up a fine performance against the Mexicans. “Everyone is giving their best because we know the task ahead. We know why we’re here and what to do to prove ourselves right. “It’s a great opportunity given to the home-based players, and we all know the task ahead, so we are all putting our heads together to ensure we fulfil it,” Iwuala said.
