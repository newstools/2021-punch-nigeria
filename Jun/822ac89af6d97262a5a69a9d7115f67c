The United States government on Thursday kicked against last Friday’s decision of the Federal Government to suspend operations of the microblogging platform, Twitter, in Nigeria. It also expressed concerns over threats of arrest and prosecution of violators issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. The US government’s position was contained in a press statement by the spokesperson of the US Department of State, Ned Price. It advised the Federal Government to respect the right of its citizens to freedom of expression by reversing the suspension. The statement read, “The United States condemns the ongoing suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government and subsequent threats to arrest and prosecute Nigerians who use Twitter. “The United States is likewise concerned that the Nigerian National Broadcasting Commission ordered all television and radio broadcasters to cease using Twitter. “Unduly restricting the ability of Nigerians to report, gather, and disseminate opinions and information has no place in a democracy. “Freedom of expression and access to information both online and offline are foundational to prosperous and secure democratic societies. “We support Nigeria as it works towards unity, peace, and prosperity.  As its partner, we call on the government to respect its citizens’ right to freedom of expression by reversing this suspension.”
