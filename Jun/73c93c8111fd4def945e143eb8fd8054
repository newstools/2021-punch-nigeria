Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested two suspected robbers, who were escaping with a vehicle stolen in Lagos State. The Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun State, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Oyeyemi said the suspects, Raymond Chukwudi and Ekene Okoro, were arrested by men of the Federal Highway Patrol at Ajebandele, a boundary between Ogun and Ondo states, while on stop-and-search. He said the suspects were arrested on Tuesday. Oyeyemi stated, “During the operation, the operatives stopped a Toyota Fortuner SUV with number plate AGL 834 GU with three occupants. “On interrogation, the occupants, whose countenance was suspicious, were unable to give satisfactory information about the vehicle; hence the policemen put a call through to the owner, whose phone number was seen on the particulars, for further enquiries. “Sensing that the game was up, one of the occupants took to his heels, while the other two were quickly apprehended. “The owner of the vehicle was later contacted and he explained that the robbers invaded his house on Iriferiogoma Street, Lakowe Phase 2, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, where they forcefully dispossessed him of the vehicle. “The two suspects were handed over to the DPO, Ogbere, for investigation.” The PPRO added that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for onward transfer to the Lagos State Police Command, which would prosecute them. ”Copyright PUNCH.
