A non-governmental organization, Face of Waziri-Nigeria, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to rescind the ban on the microblogging site, Twitter. According to the group, Twitter contributes reasonably to Nigeria’s socio-economic development and should not be “sacrificed on flimsy bases.” The Director General, FoWN, Mr Bukola Adeojo, in a statement made available to journalists on Friday, stated that the positive impact of the social media platform, far outweighed its negatives. Adeojo said the Buhari-led regime had benefited directly from social media platforms and enjoyed the ‘legitimate economic gains’ that they had been able to avail to ingenious young minds across the nation over time. The statement read in part, “Social media platforms like Twitter have become veritable tools to knowledge-sharing, political awareness and socio-economic advancement in contemporary global communities. “All election candidates since 1999 have benefited profoundly by deploying these tools. The current administration is one of the benefactors of social media in the country. “More importantly, with the economic hardships in the country as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused global recession, Twitter and other social media platforms are major means of survival for millions of Nigerians. “If the concern is indeed the divisive campaigns by some trends and social media handles, we caution that we cannot throw away the baby with the bath water, as one bad apple doesn’t spoil the bunch.” “We, therefore, call on the Federal Government to rethink and reflect on its order because of the importance of Twitter and other social media platforms as crucial developmental tools.
