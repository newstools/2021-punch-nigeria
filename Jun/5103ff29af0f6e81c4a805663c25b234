Two residents of Ajaawa in the Ogo Oluwa Local Government Area of Oyo State were reportedly killed on Wednesday. Our correspondent gathered that some herdsmen killed a butcher, popularly known as Lamidi Eleran, in the town. The butcher was said to have seen some herdsmen while they were trying to kidnap a prominent traditionalist in the town. The kidnap attempt, it was gathered, failed but the herdsmen later lured the butcher  to the bush to buy cows. He was reportedly killed by the herdsmen there. The killing was said to have led to a protest and the protesters were said to have waited in front of the house of one of the contestants for the stool of Alajaawa. The contestant reportedly opened fire on the protesters, but nobody died. The shooting  was said to have angered protesters and they vandalised his building and set it ablaze while the contestant youth managed to escape. His hotel was also said to have been  razed down by the youths to register their anger. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State Mr Adewale Osifeso, could not be reached. He did not pick calls put across to him and had yet to reply to the text  messages sent to him on the matter as at the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
