The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), says it gladdens his heart that “majority of Nigerians” appreciate him and understand what he is doing for the country since he has been in office in the last six years. Buhari spoke on Friday evening during an interview aired on NTA. When asked what gives him joy looking back in the last six years, Buhari said, “No matter how reluctantly, major of Nigerians are understanding me and appreciating the efforts we are making because right from the get-go, we identified our problem, one security; two, economy and try to fight corruption, people getting something for nothing, we have to make sure that people earn their living and they defend it.”
