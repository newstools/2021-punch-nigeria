The Acting US Consul General Brandon Hudspeth, together with members of the Young Africa Leaders Initiative have celebrated this year’s World Environment Day by participating in a tree-planting event with students of St. Saviour’s School in Lagos. The event which held on Saturday was organised by members of YALI under the auspices of the Mandela Washington Fellowship Alumni Association, with the support of a public diplomacy grant from the US Consulate General. The General Manager of Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, Dr Dolapo Fasawe; the Assistant Director of Lagos State Ministry of Environment, Folasade Adeyoju; alongside the acting US Consul, joined the students in planting a tree on the school’s ground. Hudspeth said  the inclusion of school children in the tree planting exercise empowered the future generation to take care of the environment and active participation in promoting environmental conservation and restoration of the ecosystem. He said, “Children have the potential to be powerful agents of change. By focusing on school-aged children, giving them tools and knowledge to change behaviours, future generations will be better prepared to care for the environment. The Head Teacher of St. Saviuor’s School, Mrs Lawrencia Izedonmwen, said the school was committed to promoting environmental education and responsibility among schoolchildren in its host community.
