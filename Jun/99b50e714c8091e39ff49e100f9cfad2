Troops of the Operation Safe Haven on Sunday repelled bandits attack on the Zango-Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
A statement by the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said but for the intervention of the troops, the bandits would have invaded the Gidan Zaki area of the council.
The commissioner said, “Troops of the Defence Headquarters Operation Safe Haven stationed in the Southern Kaduna general area have averted an attack by bandits that would have led to loss of lives in Gidan Zaki, Zangon Kataf Local Government Area.
“According to the report, the bandits invaded farmlands in the village, and destroyed maize crops with cutlasses.”
Aruwan said the bandits vandalised the home of one Joseph Aboi and also damaged a vehicle, as well as a phone charging shop.
The shop, the commissioner said, belonged to one Benjamin Joseph, adding that “several phones and phone accessories were carted away from shop.”
“One Angelina Francis, a resident of the village, was injured by a bullet during the shooting by the bandits. She was taken to a nearby medical facility for treatment,” he added.
The commissioner quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai to have lamented the attack, while commending security operatives for repelling the bandits. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
