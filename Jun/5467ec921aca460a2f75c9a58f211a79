VICE-President Yemi Osinbajo has described Nigeria’s first locally-assembled electric car as a fantastic innovation. He said this in Abuja on Tuesday shortly after the unveiling of the Made-in-Nigeria fair featuring the exhibition of the first electric car assembled in Nigeria, among other locally manufactured products. The Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, disclosed this in a statement titled, ‘Electric car assembled in Nigeria is a fantastic innovation; I can tell because I just drove it, says Osinbajo.’ According to the statement, Osinbajo proceeded to test-drive the automobile in the company of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, and the Director-General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council, Jelani Aliyu. While addressing journalists, he said, “It was a very good drive, fantastic. It just shows what is possible. I am glad to see that this is an assembled-in-Nigeria electric car. You can charge it anywhere. I think it is a very fantastic innovation; fantastic product and I can tell because I just drove it.” Shortly afterwards, he visited the Federal Road Safety Corps’ headquarters where he inaugurated the National Traffic Radio, 107.1 FM.
