Thought Pyramid Art Centre, an independent non-profit art space in Abuja and Lagos, is set to celebrate new works of art that reflect creativity and a possible Afro-renaissance in its upcoming solo exhibition. The solo-exhibition tagged “Dreams, Disruptions and Actualities” will be held from June 12 – 19, 2021, in the centre’s gallery in Lagos. In a statement signed by the Artistic Director, Olorogun Jeff Ajueshi, the exhibition unveils the artistic prowess of painters’ varying experiences and hopes that the works will become a reference point of artistic expressions in the future. “With unrestrained energy, we have powered our house so well to bring to the public an art show, ‘Dreams, Disruptions and Actualities,’ so that all of us can partake in the share of this successful creative menu that formed Sor Sen’s new body of works. “We have interrogated his new works and simply agreed unequivocally that the works offer a good definition of what creativity is, and keep hope alive over a possible Afro-renaissance. As a result of our culture of celebrating leading and emerging Nigerian contemporary artists, we understand that the importance of exhibiting artists whose works are contextually framed within the African narrative cannot be overemphasised.” Copyright PUNCH.
