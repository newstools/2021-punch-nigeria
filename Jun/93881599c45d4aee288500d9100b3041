The Independent National Electoral Commission has said all the 18 registered political parties in Nigeria have indicated interest to participate in the governorship election in Anambra State scheduled for November 6, 2021. INEC also noted that 17 of the 18 parties have resolved to conduct indirect primary. A National Commissioner of INEC and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, added that the National Working Committees and not state executive of the parties would be allowed to conduct primaries. Okoye made this known on Tuesday while featuring on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television monitored by our correspondent from Abuja. He said, “Out of the 18 political parties that indicated their intention to conduct party primaries, 17 of them indicated their intention to conduct indirect primary, while one political party told the commission that it will conduct direct primary. “Now for political parties that are going to conduct an indirect primary, this commission has written to all the political parties on the need for them to comply strictly with the provisions of the Constitution and the Electoral Act in relation to the conduct of their party primary. “They must set out very clearly the method of electing their delegates who are going to be the major determiners of who gets elected (candidate). We have also made it very clear to them that the list of the delegates that are going to vote at the party primary must be ready and the commission must see that list at least seven days to the conduct of the party’s primary. The political parties are already aware of this particular provision. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
