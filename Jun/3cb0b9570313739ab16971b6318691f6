The Federal Government has said efforts are ongoing to discourage the migration of health workers. According to a statement on Sunday by the Director of Information, Ministry of Health, Brendan Nwokike, the Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, disclosed this in Akure, Ondo State during the inauguration of the annexe of the Federal Medical Centre. The statement was titled, ‘Federal Government to motivate doctors, other health workers to make migration unattractive.’ The statement quoted Mamora as further saying that the Federal Government had plans to fund hospitals across the country as well as motivate doctors and other health workers. The step, the minister explained, is to make migration unattractive and to discourage medical tourism. The minister said, “This is an issue of concern for all of us and we are already looking at the factors that are responsible. “One of it is the remuneration and I want to repeat it that no amount paid to any health worker will compensate adequately, looking at the hazards they are exposed to. “So, we are working on how to increase it a bit for our health workers. You will recall that just a few days ago, we had an engagement with all the leaders of the unions in the health sector. “We are working together on how to increase and put in place a hazard allowance that will show will appreciate what they are doing.” Mamora added that Nigerian health workers have been enjoying programmes like Medical Residency which according to him are expensive in other countries. “We also have an insurance scheme in place, which everyone is entitled to. We are doing everything possible just to raise the compensation,” he said.
