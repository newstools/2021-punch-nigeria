The new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaya, on Wednesday said the war against banditry and terrorism cannot be won alone except with the cooperation of other arms of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. He added that the earlier this is recognised, the better for the armed forces and the nation to surmount the current security challenges. A statement by the Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Edward Gabkwet, quoted Yahaya as saying this when he paid a courtesy visit to the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, at NAF Headquarters in Abuja. He was also quoted as saying that NAF was crucial to the success of the ongoing fight against insurgency, armed banditry and other forms of criminality in the country. The statement titled ‘Chief of Army Staff harps on centrality of air power as he visits headquarters Nigerian Air Force.’ The statement read, “The COAS stated that he has always been an advocate of air power employment as a critical requirement of a fighting force having witnessed its formidable influence in various theatres of operations. “Major General Yahaya went on to state that the war against insurgency and armed banditry cannot be won by a single service but rather, through a synergistic approach where all services work in unison. “The earlier we all recognise that no service can do it alone, the better for us as armed forces and a nation to surmount the current security challenges.”
