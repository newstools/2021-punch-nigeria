A Nigerian prosthetics maker, Crystal Chigbu, who will appear on this week’s edition of the African Voices Changemakers, revisits the trauma of caring for a child who was born with a congenital limb deformity. According to a statement, the ordeal led to her establishing a foundation that gives succour to children whose limbs had been severed as a result of health challenges. The 30-minute magazine programme sponsored by digital solutions service provider, Globacom, will also feature a Zimbabwean electronics technician, Tendekayi Katsiga, who fabricated a solar-powered hearing aid with battery chargers for children with hearing defects. Chigbu, a 2002 graduate of Biochemistry from the University of Lagos, said, “Seeing other children and families go through the same process without a clear view on how to adapt to the challenges of living with limb loss gave vent to the creation of Irede Foundation, which has, since inception, restored hope to children living with loss of limbs by giving them prosthetics.” Katsiga, who had a chance encounter with a 15-year-old boy that could not afford a functional hearing aid, was motivated to establish Deaftronics from a workshop in Botswana from where he manufactured the world’s first solar-powered hearing device with a battery charger called ‘Solar Ear’.
