Ijeoma, the widow of a Nigerian based in Germany, Oguchi Unachukwu, has petitioned the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, and the Chief of Air staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao, over the killing of her husband by operatives of 211 Regiment of the Nigerian Air Force in Owerri. Oguchi was shot by suspected airmen at the tollgate of the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, on May 31, in the presence of his wife and two children. He was rushing to catch a flight to Lagos from where he would get a connecting flight to Hamburg, Germany, when he was shot dead. In a petition addressed to Uzodinma and Amao, the widow asked them to help her and her infant children to identify and prosecute the officer who shot her husband dead without any provocation. The distraught widow said her husband’s spirit would not rest in peace until the trigger-happy officer was identified and prosecuted in accordance with the laws of the country. She said the officer intentionally shot her husband dead. The petition read in part “My family is now in shock over the brutal murder of my husband. This has brought nightmare and everlasting torment, torture and trauma to me and the innocent children who watched the shooting to death of their unarmed father. I have now been forced into widowhood, while my children are not fatherless.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
