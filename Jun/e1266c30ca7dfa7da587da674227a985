The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has congratulated former Lagos State Commissioner for Sports and ex-President, Nigeria Table Tennis Federation, Wahid Oshodi, on his election as the Deputy President, African Table Tennis Federation. Sanwo-Olu, in a statement on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, to felicitate with Oshodi, said the elevation of the ex-NTTF boss to continental level was well deserved. Oshodi was unanimously elected at the recent virtual General Assembly of the continental body. The Governor said Oshodi deserved the continental position, having contributed immensely to the growth and development of sports, especially tennis, at national and international levels. “On behalf of the Lagos State Government and millions of Lagos residents, I felicitate with a worthy citizen of our dear state, Wahid Enitan Oshodi, on his election as the Deputy President of the African Table Tennis Federation. “The elevation of Oshodi to the position of Deputy President of ATTF is good news to us in Lagos. He really deserves the elevation, having distinguished himself in the sports industry, especially at the Tennis Federation with high level of professionalism and integrity. “We are proud of him and we believe that he will use his new position to lift the fortunes of table tennis and raise the bar of the sport in Africa to compete with the rest of the world.” Sanwo-Olu also congratulated Egypt’s Khaled El-Salhy on his re-election for a third term as the President of ATTF, as well as other new officers of the federation.
