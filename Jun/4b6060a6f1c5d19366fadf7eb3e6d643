The police in Ekiti State  on Saturday said they had begun investigation into the alleged  killing of a Department of State Services officer by soldiers in a hotel in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, Sunday Abutu, said that the victim was allegedly killed during an argument with some soldiers. Abutu said, “We heard that the DSS operative was killed during a hot argument with some soldiers yesterday (Friday). Our detectives have started investigation and we will get to the root of the matter.’’ The police spokesman said the deceased’s corpse had been deposited in the morgue and the suspects arrested. A source claimed that one of the four soldiers stabbed the DDS officer to death during the argument. The source said, “The incident happened around 7.30pm at a hotel along NTA Road in Ado Ekiti. The soldiers, who were inside the hotel, stopped the young man they suspected to be a ‘Yahoo boy’ and while interrogating him, the young man saw the DSS operative on a bike and beckoned him for help. “When the DSS officer got to the soldiers, a heated argument ensued between them and one of the soldiers became so angry that he brought out a knife and stabbed the DSS officer in the neck. “The DSS man fell immediately and started bleeding. The people inside the hotel drinking fled immediately.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
