The Lagos State Electricity Board has commenced the retrofitting of streetlights across the state from High Pressure Sodium Bulb to Light Emitting Diode (LED). The General Manager, LSEB, Mukhtaar Tijani, in a statement on Sunday explained that the LED lighting system was in consonance with government’s effort to have a smart electricity network. Tijani added that the government sought decent lightning structure and effective utilisation of resources to make the state a 21st century economy. Tijani said, “Considering the technical requirements, installation design and safety standard, the upgrade will afford the state to utilise energy in an environmentally responsible manner and achieve mass energy saving. “The light emitting diode is a rapidly-developing technology that is reshaping the energy sustainability landscape of the world, balancing economic growth and social progress with the preservation of the natural environment.” Tijani added that the adoption of the resourceful energy practice in public spaces across the state would enhance operating efficiency and improve business practices. “The diodes have touched new heights in the lighting industry with their exceptional energy efficiency, high luminous output, marathon longer working life, longevity, low maintenance cost and eco-friendly applications.” He stated that government would leverage on private sector capital investments to expand the street lighting structure.
