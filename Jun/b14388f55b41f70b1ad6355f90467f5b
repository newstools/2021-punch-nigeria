SOME bandits on Wednesday night invaded Madaka community in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State where they killed one person and kidnapped no fewer than 33 residents of the area. Several residents were said to have sustained varying degrees of injury from the attack. It was gathered that the bandits invaded the community at about 10:30 pm and started shooting indiscriminately at anything on sight while residents scampered to safety. An eyewitness said the bandits, who came in large numbers, wielding dangerous weapons, first attacked a bakery in the area, shot a driver and abducted five residents before going to another location called Mother Cat. At Mother Cat, the hoodlums kidnapped 28 residents of the area and escaped into the forest. The source said, “The bandits invaded the community on Wednesday night and started shooting sporadically when the residents were still in their shops and attending to other personal activities. “They attacked a bakery where they shot a driver and kidnapped five people before proceeding to another location called Mother Cat where they kidnapped 28 persons. He added, however, that the military intervention averted more fatality even as it was learnt that the bandits operated for more than two hours carting away foodstuffs. The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, confirmed the attack on Thursday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
