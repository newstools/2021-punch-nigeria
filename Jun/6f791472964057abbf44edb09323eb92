The joint Committee on Defence and Army of the House of Representatives, on Tuesday, screened Major General Farouk Yahaya for confirmation as Chief of Army Staff. Yahaya, in his speech before the committee called for a closed-door session, noted that he was 55 years old and bringing experiences from a 36-year career to the office. The COAS designate said, “I am Major General Farouk Yahaya. I was born January 5, 1966…in Sokoto State. I joined the military 36 years ago. So, if you will, I have brought a lot with me; 36 years of military experience, having joined the Army on the 26th September, 1985, as a member of the 37th Regular Course in the NDA (Nigerian Defence Academy). I passed on the 22nd September, 1990. “Since that time, I have passed through all the relevant courses commensurate with my career as I grow up and I have in various capacities, including command, staff, administration and extracurricular.” The Chairman of the House Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson,  noted that the exercise was coming at a very challenging time in the history of the country. Benson said, “The Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity. I therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new Chief of Army Staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
