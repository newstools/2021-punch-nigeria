A former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof Maurice Iwu, has said the indigenes of Imo State are also to be blamed for the insecurity in the state. Imo has in recent times witnessed attacks by gunmen on police formations. Also, a correctional centre was attacked leading to the release of more than 1,000 inmates. Last month, a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak, was killed in the state while on his way to the airport. Iwu, who spoke in an interview with Arise TV on Wednesday, said the insecurity in the state festered because of the silence of the indigenes. “Imo is a place where many people come to. No matter who’s causing the problem from outside, there must be some participation by Imo people for that to happen,” he said. “A situation where we are killing people that have come to protect us is stupid. We can’t be killing policemen that are here to protect us. We can’t have our young people being molested because of our own excesses. We Imolites are part of the cause. We can’t exonerate ourselves completely but yet we’re also part of Nigeria. “We’re guilty, all of us in Imo state, are guilty for allowing such things to happen. For not shouting early enough, we are all guilty.” He added that the situation in the state is also a result of low employment rate and poverty. “Right now, what is happening, we are having our own share of national insecurity. We’re also having some local players and the situation which is inherent anywhere you have a very low employment rate and poverty manifests. We don’t know what is the main trigger. But whatever is the trigger, if we don’t have our people who are ready to be used, then it would not happen,” he said.
