The counsel for Kemisola Ogunniyi, who delivered a baby in prison custody, Mr Tope Temokun, has said it is not compulsory for the public to know the identity of the child’s father. Ogunniyi was remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Service, Ondo, for alleged involvement in the vandalisation of property belonging to the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress during the October 2020 #EndSARS protest in Akure. The baby she gave birth to in prison was christened on Wednesday after she was granted bail by the state High Court in Olokuta Akure, on Tuesday. The wife of the Ooni of Ife, Olori Naomi Ogunwusi, at the christening of the baby on Wednesday, presented the family with various baby items and foodstuffs, while an Akure-based medical doctor, Dr Thomas-Wilson Ikubese, offered the baby scholarship from nursery to secondary school levels. Her counsel, Temokun, who featured on Thursday on a programme on Empire FM Radio, Akure, said many Nigerians had been showing interest in helping Ogunniyi and her baby. When asked about the baby’s father, the legal practitioner explained that he had rights to his privacy. He said, “The right to privacy and family life of an individual is a right that is guaranteed in the constitution. If that right is constitutional, it is not possible for anybody to force the person to make himself public for whatever reason. “The constitution guarantees the rights to privacy, family and all that. If somebody decides to cover his face with a mask, provided he is not shooting a gun, you don’t have the right to force the person to open it. So, we should leave it like that.” Copyright PUNCH.
