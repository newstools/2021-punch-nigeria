THE All Progressives Congress has commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for approving the establishment of five new specialized Universities of Technology, Health and Pharmaceutical sciences. This was contained in a statement titled, “APC Commends President Buhari Over New Varsities,” signed by the Acting National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in Abuja, on Wednesday. He said, “The APC on behalf of its teeming supporters and members commends President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the establishment of five new specialized Universities in technology, health  and pharmaceutical sciences in the country. “It is a demonstration of the responsiveness of the government to the call by the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and citizens for more federal tertiary institutions in the country. “Commendably, President Buhari is fulfilling the APC’s electoral promise to lead an education revolution and transform the country technologically as captured in the 2015 APC manifesto and outlined in the Education for Change Ministerial Strategic Plan 2018-2022.” “Triggered by eventualities of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the need to reduce medical tourism, this is also a proactive intervention by the President Buhari-led APC government to boost the country’s institutional capacity for disease control and surveillance, particularly with respect to medical facilities, trained personnel and supporting infrastructure.” Copyright PUNCH.
