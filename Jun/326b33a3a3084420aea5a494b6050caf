The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration will continue to support initiatives that will positively impact and create avenues for children and youths in the state to be creative. The governor, according to a statement on Wednesday, stated this while receiving the president and founder of the New Era Foundation, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, who paid him a courtesy visit at the Lagos House, Marina. Sanwo-Olu told Tinubu, who is the Senator representing Lagos Central Senatorial District, that the Musical Youth Fiesta Initiative started by her 10 years ago had provided opportunities for thousands of children and youth in the State. “A lot of children and youth have been impacted through you and we cannot imagine the seed that the Musical Youth Fiesta Initiative has thrown up, but we know that God is doing great things in their individual lives. That becomes a comforting model for us,” he said. Earlier, Tinubu commended Sanwo-Olu for partnering her, members of the board of trustees and other stakeholders to provide opportunities for 5,000 children and youth yearly through a showcase of talent in music, dance and drama. For the 10th anniversary, Tinubu said the board gave out N2.5m each to four churches that had been major partners, adding that remaining fund in the account would be transferred to the New Era Foundation for continuous support of youths and children. Tinubu was accompanied by gospel artist and renowned saxophonist, Pastor Kunle Ajayi, who served as the coordinator of the Musical Youth Fiesta Initiative. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
