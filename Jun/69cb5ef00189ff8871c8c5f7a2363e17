A 35-year-old man, Kingsley Achugbu, has been arrested by police operatives attached to the Festac Division of the Lagos State Police Command for allegedly defiling his two-year-old daughter and sexually harassing his wife’s maid. A statement by the command’s Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the maid reported the matter to the police, adding that the two-year-old victim had been taken to hospital for examination. The statement read in part, “The housemaid had reported the matter to the police at Festac Division in company with one Mrs Justina Nelson of the Children and Vulnerable Persons Network and the police swung into action immediately. The two-year-old victim has been taken to hospital for medical examination and expert report for further investigation. “The Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has, however, ordered that the matter be transferred to the Gender Unit of the command for further investigation and possible prosecution.” Odumosu appealed to members of the public to always report all cases of sexual harassment and assault as well as domestic violence to the police or relevant government agencies and non-governmental organisations for necessary action.
