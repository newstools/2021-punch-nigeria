A suspected kidnapper was shot dead during a gun duel between a gang of kidnappers and policemen in Ogun State. Men of Ogun State Police Command killed the suspect in Mologede Area of Odeda Local Government Area of the state. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi disclosed this on Saturday. Oyeyemi said the incident happened on Friday after policemen received a distress call. The PPRO explained that a distress call was received by the Divisional Police Officer, Bode Olude Divisional Headquarters at about 12 noon on Friday. He said “The police were told that a tipper driver had been kidnapped by a group of people suspected to be herdsmen. “Upon the distress call, the DPO Bode Olude Division, DSP Durojaye Rotimi, mobilized his men, the local hunters, men of So-Safe-Corps as well as policemen from adjoining police stations and moved to the area. “While combing the bush, the kidnappers were sighted in the forest where they engaged the policemen in a gun battle. “In the process, one of the kidnappers was shot on the leg, while others escaped with various degrees of gunshot injuries, while the victim was rescued unhurt. “One single barrel gun was recovered from them, while the suspect gave up the ghost on the way to the hospital.” The PPRO, however, said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun who commended his men for their display of gallantry, ordered a massive manhunt for the fleeing members of the gang. Oyeyemi said Ajogun also applauded the support given to the police by men of So-Safe corps, Hunters, and Odua People Congress, and sought for the continuation of such cooperation.
