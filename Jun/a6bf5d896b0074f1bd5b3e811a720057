Two persons lost their lives, while three others sustained varying degrees of injury on Monday in a crash involving a Nissan Sentra car and a Mack truck at Adedero village on the Abeokuta-Sagamu Expressway. The spokesman for the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the accident. Akinbiyi explained that the crash occurred around 5.45am, adding that it was caused by reckless driving on the part of the Nissan Sentra driver. He said, “According to investigation carried out by the TRACE corps rescue team, the driver of the car picked passengers from Kobape inbound Abeokuta before the vehicle ran into a broken down  truck at Adedero village as a result of reckless driving and poor visibility. “The injured victims were rescued before TRACE corps personnel arrived at the scene, while the combined team of TRACE, the FRSC and the police took the dead victims in the FRSC patrol vehicle to the morgue of the State Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta. “The sum of N230,620 was retrieved from the dead victims’ bodies. One was with N153,620 and the other had N77,000. “The money has been handed over to the families of the victims. “We learnt that they were fish sellers going to Abeokuta to buy fish before the unfortunate accident happened.” He commiserated with the families of the victims, while advising drivers to always remove their vehicles from the road in case of a breakdown. He urged motorists to avoid reckless driving, especially under poor visibility. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
