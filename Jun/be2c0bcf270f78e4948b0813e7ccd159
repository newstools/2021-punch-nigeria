One of Nigeria’s first four Architecture graduates, Fola Alade, is dead. Alade died on Saturday at the age of 87, family sources in Aramoko-Ekiti, Ekiti State, said. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that architectural masterpieces bearing his insignia included the 1004 Housing Estate, Victoria Island, Lagos, defunct Federal Secretariat building, Ikoyi, Lagos, and the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. Meanwhile, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has condoled with family and friends of Alade. The president in a condolence message by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Sunday noted that Alade left behind a legacy of brilliance and diligence. The president commiserated with government and people of Ekiti over the loss, believing that Alade’s contributions to development of the country in design, building and administration would always be remembered by posterity. He particularly noted the contributions of Alade to the historic structures like “the National Stadium Lagos, Tafawa Balewa Square, Federal Secretariat Lagos and Nigerian Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies building in Kuru, Plateau.” Similarly, the Speaker, Ekiti House of Assembly, Mr Funminiyi Afuye, in his condolence message described Alade’s demise as a great loss to Ekiti State and Nigeria. A statement by Afuye’s Special Adviser on Media, Mr Tai Oguntayo, on Sunday said the foremost architect was the giant pillar behind the various physical structures of many institutions in Nigeria today. He said, “The late architect was a patriot in the real sense who left his mark on the sands of time.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
