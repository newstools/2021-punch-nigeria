THE Ondo State Government said on Wednesday that the herdsmen in the state had yet to comply with its directive on registration. The state government said he herdsmen had not registered their cattle business with the state government. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu had ordered that herdsmen who wanted to do business of cattle rearing should register with the government through the office of his Special Adviser on Security Matters. The Secretary to the State Government, Princess Oladunni Odu, stated this at a two-day lecture for the participants of the Senior Executive Course 43, 2021 of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos. The programme which was held at Ilara Mokin, in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, was themed, ‘Getting things done: Strategies for policy and programme implementation in Nigeria’. Odu said, “We did not ban open grazing overnight in Ondo State; the governor at the beginning, did say if you are here to rear cattle and follow our forests, please, come forward and register otherwise you will be staying in our forest illegally. “He (Akeredolu) gave them the opportunity to come and register but they did not come to register as the governor has allowed them in Ondo State.” The SSG, who welcomed the participants to the state, also said he would replicate the Federal Government’s National Policy on Ageing for Older Persons in Ondo State, adding that the state government had already taken care of the aged people in the state.
