THE Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, has appointed a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Cletus Obun, as Special Adviser, Strategic Communications. Obun was a member of the Cross River House of Assembly. This was contained in a statement signed by the governor’s Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, in Calabar, on Tuesday. Ita said, “The state Governor, His Excellency, Ben Ayade, has approved the following appointments: Victor Omaga Odo JP, State Chairman, Universal Basic Education Board; Mr. Cletus Obun, Special Adviser, Strategic Communications, and Mrs. Bukie Okangbe, Senior Special Assistant, New Media.” The media aide said the appointments took “immediate effect.’’ Other positions yet to be filled by Governor Ayade include those of members of his cabinet who resigned in the wake of his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the APC. Recall that the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Asu Okang, and his Women Affairs counterpart, Rita Ayim, were among those who resigned their positions in protest. Copyright PUNCH.
