One Akin, believed to be the prime suspect in the killing of a yet-to-be identified lady in Apomu last Thursday, has been arrested by the operatives of Osun State Police Command. The state Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, confirmed the arrest on Sunday in a chat with The PUNCH. The PUNCH had reported that a night guard, Kabiru Oyeduntan, was earlier arrested and paraded by the police for killing a lady brought to his house in Apomu by his friend, Akin. After killing the victim, the two men also allegedly dismembered the body with the intention of using parts for money ritual. Although, Oyeduntan was arrested hours after perpetrating the crime, Akin, reportedly escaped and fled Apomu to evade arrest. Giving update on the incident during a chat with our correspondent, Olokode said, “Relying on intelligence, we were able to arrest Akin who masterminded the killing. He escaped to Ibadan, but we have arrested him and he is currently being held by the detectives for further investigation.” Reacting to the alleged harassment of members of Civil Societies Coalition at the venue of June 12 Lecture in Osogbo on Saturday, Olokode those behind the allegations failed to submit themselves for screening at the entrance of the hall.
