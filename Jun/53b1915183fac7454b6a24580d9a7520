A former Special Assistant to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), on Assembly Matters, Abdurrahman Sumaila, says right-thinking Nigerians won’t endanger their lives to support the candidature of any South-East politician vying for presidency in 2023.

I am sure not a single right-thinking Nigerian will endanger his life to support the candidature of any South-East politician contesting for presidency come 2023 general elections,” he said. He also noted that it has now become clear that the motive behind the attacks is to turn the country into anarchy, regretting that “the perpetrators of the attacks must understand that if the country is turned chaotic, then nobody including the perpetrators can escape”. He, therefore, urged elders in the South-East to publicly denounce the ongoing attacks by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra or be considered complicit in the dastardly act. The ex-presidential aide said until the Southern elite make their position definite, Nigerians would consider them part and parcel of the attacks being carried out in the region by armed militia. “The elite in the South-East should borrow a leaf from their northern counterparts such as Arewa Consultative Forum and Northern Elders Forum, who have been persistently condemning the activities of Boko Haram fighters and bandits in the North,” he said.
