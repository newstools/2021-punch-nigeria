The Director General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, Mr Alex Okoh, has said that the concession of the Kano free trade zone would bring $2bn export value by 2027. This was contained in a statement by Abba Anwar, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Kano State and issued to newsmen in Kano on Wednesday. According to Anwar, Okoh made the disclosure when he paid a courtesy call on Governor Abdullahi Ganduje at the Government House, Kano on Tuesday. He expressed optimism that the Kano FTZ would become the destination choice for agri-business, textile companies and leather industries. According to the statement, the zone is further envisioned to create jobs, promote exports, improve infrastructure development, boost growth and upgrade skills. “The proposed concession of the FTZs are therefore intended to be used to transform the two FTZs (Kano and Calabar) into world class standard facilities as obtainable in other regions like Asia, etc. “It will create massive job opportunities for the teeming youths in the immediate locality and to promote exports, attract foreign direct investment, improve infrastructure amongst other benefits.” The BPE DG solicited the participation of the Kano State Government in the concession by partnering other private sector firms as a consortium with the state equity not exceeding 24 per cent. In his remarks, Governor Ganduje pledged the support and commitment of his administration towards the planned concession of the facility. “I am assuring you that as a state, we will do our best to see how we can move things to work very well,” he said.
