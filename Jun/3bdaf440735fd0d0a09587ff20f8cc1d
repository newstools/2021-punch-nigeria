Over 159 people have reportedly been killed by bandits, herdsmen, robbers and other non-state actors in just five days, a report by Amnesty International shows. Amnesty made this known on their official Twitter handle, @AmnestyInternational on Tuesday evening. The tweet read, “From Saturday, June 5, 2021, to date, more Nigerians have been killed: —Kebbi State: Danko-Wasagu 88 killed —Oyo State: Igangan 11 killed —Benue State: Agatu 30 killed —Zamfara: Zurmi 30 killed.” This brings the total to 159 people killed due to the ravaging insecurity sweeping the country. In the comment section, Nigerians had berated the president for diverting attention from the raging insecurity in the country to ‘chase shadows’ with the Twitter ban. @WajeEmmanuel, called the government “blood suckers.” Similarly, @9jaWolex, tweeted, “Government only cares about personal fights with an independent American company, Tweeter, but fails to protect the lives and properties of its citizens which is the primary purpose of the Government.” @BetaBae wrote, “Imo State is now a state of the blood of young people who had better dreams and hopes for the Nigerian nation but were arrested and taken for execution in some unknown location, while some were killed at the spot for being young… I weep for my nation.” “Well they are more concerned about Twitter because they feel it is an opposition party to them,” @Olayiwolabalo said. The PUNCH had earlier reported that bandits, herdsmen, others, had killed 394 and kidnapped 224 Nigerians in one month. Amnesty had, in previous tweets, urged the Federal Government to protect her citizens, following multiple attacks which have undermined the nation’s sovereignty and economy.
