The Women Advocates’ Research and Documentation Centre has called on the Lagos State Government to involve more women in governance and other activities that will increase their relevance in politics and decision making. Speaking in Lagos at a two-day training for women groups on policy and decision-making on prevention and response to violence against women and girls, one of the facilitators, Mr Ade Adebusoye, explained that the world was made of 50 per cent women, adding that it would be inappropriate to relegate them to the background. The programme was part of a joint UN-EU Spotlight Initiative project. Adebusoye said, “We should ensure that men and women have equal opportunities for resources, even elections, in policy formulation and everything generally…We can clearly say that we are missing out in Nigeria if we don’t engage the women and ensure that the quality at all levels are there.” The Director, WARDC, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, said, “Gender-based violence is widespread and 30 per cent of women aged 15 and 49 have reported experiences of sexual abuse, with a marked divide between girls and women in urban and rural areas.” Copyright PUNCH.
