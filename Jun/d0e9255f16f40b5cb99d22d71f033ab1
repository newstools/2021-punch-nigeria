THE United Nations Children’s Fund on Tuesday called on the G-7 countries to donate to the COVAX facility which is an international vaccine equity initiative created to support most less privileged countries in COVID-19 vaccine acquisition. Recall that the Serum Institute of India, which is the major supplier to the COVAX facility, had declared its intention to suspend vaccine export due to the rising cases of COVID-19 in India. This has led to vaccine shortage in Nigeria and other African countries that depend on the facility for the supply of vaccine. UNICEF partners and ambassadors, in a joint statement titled, ‘An open letter on COVID-19 vaccine’, specifically pleaded with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and the United States, which are member countries of G-7, to donate to the COVAX facility. The statement, which was released on Tuesday, read in part, “UNICEF is already on the ground delivering vaccines on behalf of COVAX, the international vaccine equity initiative. “But right now, COVAX is 190 million doses short of where it needs to be, which leaves vulnerable people dangerously unprotected. Some countries have committed to donating vaccines later this year, but doses are needed now. “UNICEF analysis shows that G-7 countries will soon have enough doses to donate 20 per cent of their vaccines between June and August – over 150 million doses – without significant delay to current plans to vaccinate their adult populations. “We are asking you to make these urgent donations by August and to set out a roadmap to scale up donations as supplies increase. Forecasts suggest as many as one billion doses may be available for donation by year end.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
