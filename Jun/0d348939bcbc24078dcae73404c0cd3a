The Independent National Electoral Commission has declared its readiness to resume the nationwide Continuous Voter Registration scheduled for June 28. This was made known on Thursday by the INEC Deputy Director of Voter Education Division, Mary Nkem, at a roadshow on the CVR organised by the commission in Abuja. According to Nkem, the exercise would be taking place from 9 am to 3 pm from Monday to Friday, excluding weekends. “It will involve two processes, that is, online pre-registration and physical registration. “ So, people can sit in the comfort of their homes and login details for registration. “Then go to any of our local government or state office to capture their biometrics and photographs; or you appear physically at any designated register,” she said. She also said that the commission would come up with the guidelines for the collection of permanent voters’ card. At the road show were INEC staff members from the voter education and publicity department, members of the National Youth Service Corps, among others. The road show was to create awareness and to mobilise eligible voters in Abuja for the resumption of the exercise. “It is also to let FCT residents know those who are being targeted in the exercise; those who have turned 18 after the last registration exercise, or those who are more than 18 years but have never registered. “This exercise is also for those who have issues with their accreditation during the past elections, those who have issues with their Permanent Voter Cards or their biometric details,” Nkem explained.
