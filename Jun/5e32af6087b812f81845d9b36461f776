The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had during his June 12 Democracy Speech, said he was targeting lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years. He said his regime had already lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty in the last two years. He said, “In the last two years, we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty – farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like. “I am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.” Despite the poverty alleviation programmes established by Buhari’s regime, the World Bank recently said in its ‘Nigeria Development Update’ report, that inflation pushed about seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020.
