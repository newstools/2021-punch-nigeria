Broadband penetration in Nigeria increased by 91.70 per cent in the last four years, data from the Nigerian Communications Commission show. The country’s broadband penetration increased from 21.21 per cent in April 2017 to 40.66 per cent in April 2021. The NCC data show that in April 2021, 77,605,500 million Nigerians were connected to the Internet, up from 40,481,570 million in April 2017. The country has, however, seen a decline in broadband penetration in recent months following the Federal Government’s recent policy of linking National Identity Number with SIM cards. Broadband penetration dropped from 42.93 per cent in January 2021 to 40.66 per cent in April, according to the NCC. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, had said earlier this month that the Federal Government hoped to achieve 90 per cent broadband penetration in the country by 2023. He said, “We developed the National Broadband Plan 2020-2030, which targets a 90 per cent penetration rate in terms of population and a 70 per cent rate in terms of our total landmass within the next two years. It also targets a speed of 25mbps for urban areas while a 10mbps speed is targeted for rural areas. “So far, we have been able to achieve a 10 per cent increase just within a year which brings the success rate to 45 per cent. This is unprecedented and it is because of the President’s commitment to a digital Nigeria and support in approving our policies.” The PUNCH had recently reported that stakeholders in the telecom industry said the nation needed a capital investment of $5bn to be able to implement its new broadband plan. According to the stakeholders, the funds should be sourced from the private sector while the government should provide the necessary incentives to ensure the success of the project. They estimated that extensive deployment of fibre optics infrastructure and connection to towers could help the country achieve 90 per cent 4G coverage in the next five years. According to Proshare Nigeria, in 2020, there was a visible shift to fibre broadband internet plans, which do not necessarily need SIM cards to function. It noted that some residential estates have adopted this service given the heavy reliance on internet services at home, due to the lockdowns and restriction on movement. The company further suggested that a 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration could grow the Gross Domestic Product of the nation’s economy by 1.6 to 1.8 per cent. Copyright PUNCH.
