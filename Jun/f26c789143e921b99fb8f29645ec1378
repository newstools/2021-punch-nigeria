Social media giant, Facebook has officially launched integrated podcasts and live audio room services. In an earlier report by The PUNCH, the company had announced its intention to introduce podcast and live audio services to the platform in April. The Head of Facebook App Fiji Simo made the official launch known in a statement via her Facebook page on Monday. “This past April, we announced our plans to bring social audio experience to Facebook and this week we will start to bring this to life by rolling out live audio rooms and podcasts on Facebook,” she announced. While the podcast services are only available in the US for now, “Public figures on Facebook and few Facebook groups will have opportunity to create live audio rooms.” Fiji Simo revealed in April that audio creation tools which are like “having a sound studio in your pocket.” will also be made available to the users. The tools will enable the creation of short-form Soundbites such as jokes, anecdotes, spontaneous thoughts and “many other things we have not imagined” The new services are also expected to be monetized as creators hosting Live Audio Rooms have the opportunity to get paid directly by fans. According to Simo, Facebook will also be launching “..an Audio Creator Fund to support emerging audio creators and get early feedback on these new products.
