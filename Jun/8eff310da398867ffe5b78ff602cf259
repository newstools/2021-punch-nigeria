Coscharis Motors has said it is set to unveil locally-assembled Renault brands, the new Ford Trucks lines and the latest model of the Ford Explorer. Its Group General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Abiona Babarinde, said in a statement that the showcasing would be done at the ongoing Lagos Auto Fair. “For the first time, as the exclusive distributors of these great brands in Nigeria, we are excited to showcase the locally assembled Renault Brands, the new Ford Trucks lines and also keen to reveal the latest model of the Ford Explorer,” he said. According to him, the focus is to showcase the Ford and Renault brands and at the same time introduce the Ford Trucks brand of heavy-duty commercial vehicles into the Nigerian market. Babarinde added that the auto fair would be an opportunity to bring these vehicles closer to the customers and prospects alike that had been unable to visit the dealerships in recent times. He said, “More importantly, the fair is to equally make the purchase of any of our brands on display very friendly with the introduction of our finance scheme packages through our select finance partner platforms. “These are some of the highlights of our participation this time around amongst other offerings to delight our numerous stakeholders to continually deliver value for their money.” Copyright PUNCH.
