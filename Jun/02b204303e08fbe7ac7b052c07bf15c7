The Chairman of the Equal Opportunity Group of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Peter Okebukola, has stressed the need for blind students to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects. Okebukola said this on Wednesday during the take-off of UTME for blind candidates in Lagos, saying the nation would benefit if blind candidates enroll in STEM subjects. He said, “We are excited about candidates, though few, who offer STEM subjects since this is an important slant to equal opportunity. A study has been underway since 2018 to explore ways of encouraging many blind candidates to study STEM subjects recognising the inclement conditions for the study of science by blind candidates at the secondary school and post-secondary school levels. “The nation benefits from STEM, so, we don’t want to see only engineers that are sighted, we want doctors, and other professionals among those having challenges with their eyes. The benefit of having blind candidates enrol for STEM subjects is enormous; it will enhance national development and these blind professionals will also serve as role models to those coming behind.” Okebukola said no fewer than 335 blind candidates have enrolled in UTME in 11 centres across the country. “In 2019, of the 390 candidates, a total of 175 were given admission. This was unprecedented in the history of admission of such a category of students into the Nigerian higher education system. In 2020, 89 of the 351 candidates who sat for UTME were given admission. The encouraging development since 2020 is that many more degree-award awarding institutions are showing keen interest in admitting suitably qualified blind candidates.” Copyright PUNCH.
