A  young lady who went missing on Saturday was on Tuesday found dead in her room in Mosogar, in the Ethiope West Local Government Area of Delta State, with vital parts of her body missing. Sources said the deceased, aged 29, whose identity could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, brought a man home on Saturday night, when she was last seen by her neighbours. A neighbour, who did not want her name in print, said, “The man was later seen leaving that night; but since then, we did not see her only to discover this morning (Tuesday) that she was dead, with her vital organs missing.” Another source said the neighbours became worried about the lady’s whereabouts days later when they began to perceive foul odour from the direction of her room. They later alerted security operatives, who forced the door open. “This morning (Tuesday) we informed the police and the door was forced open, only to find her corpse, with her breasts and private parts gone,” he added. The state acting Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident, adding that the police had already removed the corpse and taken it to a morgue for autopsy while investigations were ongoing.
