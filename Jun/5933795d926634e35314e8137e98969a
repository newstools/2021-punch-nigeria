THE crisis between Omor and Anaku communities in Ayamelum Local Government Area of Anambra State has deepened following an attack on rice farmers. The spokesperson for Omor, Udoji Amaedu, said many were feared missing or even dead in the attack. He said trouble began following the blocking of a federal road leading to Ayamelum Local Government Area by Anaku youths. Amaedu gave the names of those abducted and possibly killed as James Nzekwesi, Chukwutoo Onyeagolu, Emmanuel Raymond and others. He said, “These people are all from Omor who are yet to be seen or heard from.” It was gathered that armed youths stormed the farmland around 8.20am and allegedly opened fired on the rice farmers. The two communities had engaged themselves in similar attack last month houses and other valuables were destroyed. A rice farmer from Omor, Okwudili Chukwuemeka, said, “I was in my rice farm spreading chemicals when they opened fire on us. I screamed as I ran for my dear life. Thank God, I escaped without any injury,” he said. Another farmer, Avuluiveekwulu Obiorah, said, “I had thought efforts were in top gear to resolving the crisis but I was shocked when I heard gunshots and saw Omor farmers running out of their farms. As we ran, we heard them chanting war songs. The Local Government Chairman, Benjamin Onyeabo, a lawyer, said he got the information and quickly initiated a move to avert further face-off between the two communities. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, said he had yet to be briefed on the development. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
