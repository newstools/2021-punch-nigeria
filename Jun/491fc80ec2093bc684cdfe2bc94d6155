Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, on Saturday said he sacked his Secretary to the State Government, Sabi’u Baba; Chief of Staff, Dr Ladan Salihu; 21 commissioners and special advisers to bring the state out of a quagmire. Mohammed, who disclosed this while marking Democracy Day in Zaki town, explained that he could not work with the sacked members of his cabinet because he needed ‘real politicians’ he could work with to move the state forward. The former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory had on June 9, 2021, relieved Baba, Salihu, and over 20 commissioners and SAs of their appointments. He, however, retained his special advisers on security, national and state assembly liaison, social investment, and media and publicity. But the governor said in Zaki that he dissolved the State Executive Council to allow others to serve, adding that the sacked aides did not know how to play politics. Mohammed said, “Those that I stopped, they don’t know how to play politics and I cannot work with those types of people. I just have to get others, real politicians that can do the job together with me and bring Bauchi out of a quagmire.” Meanwhile, the governor, during the event, empowered 1,200 women and youths with materials worth N150m in Zaki and Gamawa local government areas. He said the gesture was part of the Kaura Economic Empowerment Programme, adding that his administration was poised to improve the welfare of the citizens. He said the state government had in the past two years embarked on several developmental projects across the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
