In commemoration of the World Environment Day, the National President, Cleaning Practitioners Association of Nigeria, Dr Tunde Ayeye, has urged Nigerians to protect the environment by keeping it clean. Speaking at a media parley on Tuesday, Ayeye said CPAN had launched its flagship program – the Clean Up Green Up crusade, to encourage ecosystem restoration. He stated that the group would embark on advocacy activities to get the public to imbibe the tenets and principles under the Clean Up and the Green Up crusade. Ayeye said, “June 5 of every year is World Environment Day that is commemorated by the United Nations. We at CPAN have lined up a series of events to commemorate the day. “We are actually starting crusades because we believe that the environment is the only thing that nature has given all of us to protect as cleaners.” He added that the body would organise an advocacy walk on June 4, and an exhibition on June 8 along with other people. ”Copyright PUNCH.
