Gunmen suspected to be armed robbers have shot dead Mrs. Olayemi Odetomi, wife of a former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in Oyo State, Peter Oderomi. Our correspondent gathered that the 66-year-old woman was shot at her home around Bodija-Ashi Area of Ibadan early Friday morning. The deceased’s husband, who was a former chairman of Ogbomoso South Local Government Area of Oyo State served as a commissioner during the administration of late Governor Abiola Ajimobi. Although some persons claimed that Mrs. Odetomi’s killing was done by armed robbers, some said the woman was assassinated. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Adewale Osifeso, said police had begun an investigation into the killing. He said in a statement that “the deceased, Olayemi Odetomi, aged 66 years, died on the spot after being shot during a robbery incident which occurred during the early hours of Friday 25th June 2021 in her home. “Updates on investigations will be provided in due course.” Recall that a popular radio presenter in Ibadan, who is also an indigene of Ogbomoso, Titus Badejo, was last Saturday shot dead while leaving a club at the Oluyole Area of Ibadan.
