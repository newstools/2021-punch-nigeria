The Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, Umar Muri, on Monday said the command under him would not work with vigilantes, who were repentant criminals, in a bid to rid the state of bandits and other criminal elements. According to the CP, the only sets of vigilantes to work with are those with the fear of God. Muri stated this while on a confidence-building visit to the Palace of the Emir of Zazau, in Zaria, Kaduna State. Other heads of security operatives in the state on the visit were the General Officer Commanding 1 Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Major General Ali Keffi; state Director of the Department of State Services, Idris Koya, among others. They were led on the visit by the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan. The CP disclosed that repentant criminals were always in the habit of giving out information to criminal elements. “When repentant criminals are given as vigilantes, instead of assisting the police to solve the problem, they may end up compromising,” he added. Muri urged residents to volunteer information to security agencies in the fight against banditry and other related crimes, assuring them of the command’s commitment to secure their lives and property.
