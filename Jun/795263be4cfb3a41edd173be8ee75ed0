As efforts to complement the efforts of taming insecurity in Kebbi State, political office holders in the state have donated half of their June, 2021 salary. This gesture was announced by the Secretary to the State Government, Babale Yauri, in Birnin Kebbi, on Monday. According to Yauri, “this decision comes at a better time when all hands were on deck to tame the myriad of security challenges in the state and Nigeria, at large. “Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu and the various security agencies are working round the clock to ensure the restoration of normalcy across the state. “This gesture is, therefore, our widow’s mite in this direction and we are fully committed to do everything humanly possible to ensure that, the insecurity monster is roundly overwhelmed.” Yauri further noted that the fight against the raging security challenges should not be left to the government and the security agencies alone. The SSG reiterated that the urgent restoration of peace and unity in the state and Nigeria was the only panacea needed for even socioeconomic development.
