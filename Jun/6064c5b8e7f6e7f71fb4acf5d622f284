THE Inspector General of Police, Baba Usman, on Monday described the security challenge facing Plateau State as unique. Usman spoke at the Government House in Jos on Monday during the inauguration of 50 security vehicles and 200 motorcycles purchased by Governor Simon Lalong-led administration. He recalled how a special police operation recently arrested a seven-man criminal syndicate who specialised in local fabrication of AK-47 in Plateau State and recovered assorted arms and ammunition, including eight locally fabricated AK-47 rifles, eleven magazines of AK-47 rifles and eight pistols. The IGP said the syndicates whose operations were based in Jos had been supplying arms and ammunition to bandits in Plateau and other states which they used in terrorising innocent citizens. He added, “The ungoverned places in Plateau will be recovered by the grace of God and we will dedicate more people to make sure that you operate under an atmosphere of law abiding citizens that will go about their lawful business.” Earlier, Lalong appealed to the IG to look into the problem of unfulfilled security promises to the state by the Federal Government such as the establishment of the Mobile Police Barracks in Gashish communities, shoddy prosecution of suspects and poor mismanagement of intelligence.
