An educationist, Mrs Mrs Feyisara Ojugo, has urged parents to instil a growth mindset in their children. Ojugo to who is also the head of Greensprings School, Lekki campus, gave the advice during a presentation on the ‘Thinking School Philosophy’ programme organised by the school. According to her, “the power of yet” is a growth mindset language that builds children’s confidence and motivates them to keep persisting in the face of challenges while learning a new skill. She added, “To inspire children to be confident in their ability to learn and acquire new skills, parents should encourage a growth mindset in them. Instead of watching children say they can’t do something, parents should ask their children to add the word, ‘yet’ to the statement. For example, instead of allowing a child to conclude he or she can’t ride a bicycle after several trials, the child should be made to say he or she can’t ride a bicycle yet,” she said.
