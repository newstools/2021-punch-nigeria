The statement said, “Professor Wole Soyinka wishes to denounce the fake WhatsApp posting on the Yoruba state agitation being attributed to him. “Once again, he requests the public to ignore the utterances of those contemptible interlopers, who lack the courage of their conviction and thus take to identity theft for the furtherance of their views.
