The Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has expelled former governorship aspirants of the party, Mrs Jumoke Anifowose and Mr Nathaniel Adojutelegan, for allegedly involving in anti-party activities. Both Anifowose and Adojutelegan, who had approached the court to challenge the candidacy of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu in the last governorship primary of the party held in 2019, recently lost the legal battle at the Supreme Court. Anifowose is the daughter of a former governor of the state, Pa Adekunle Ajasin. Addressing journalists on the decision of the party on Friday, the state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, said the action of the party on the duo was based on the report of the fact-finding committee set up by the party to look into the allegation. When contacted, Anifowose denied any involvement in anti-party activities and rejected the action of the party, declaring that she could not be expelled from the party. She said, “They cannot expel me; I’m the one that will expel them when the time comes. Is it because I fought for my right that they expelled me? They are nonentities in the party. Did they query me? Did they write me any letter? Where is their letter? They just came up now saying they expelled me. They can’t. I didn’t engage in any anti-party activity.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
