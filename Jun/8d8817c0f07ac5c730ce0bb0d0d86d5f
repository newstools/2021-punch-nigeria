The Aliko Dangote Foundation said it partnered with other organisations to launch a training programme worth €7m to bridge skills gap in the country. It said in a statement that the programme was in partnership with Germany’s VDMA (the German Association for Mechanical and Plant Engineering), and its Foundation for Young Talent in Mechanical Engineering (NWS). The statement said the technical training programme which was launched in Nigeria aimed to address skills deficit in key sectors of the nation’s economy. Speaking at the official launching of the programme on Wednesday, the President, Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, said that the landmark programme was a €7m investment. He said a large percentage of it was for the specialised, leading-edge equipment that had been shipped from Germany and installed in five workshops built for the programme at Dangote Academy in Obajana. He also said the beneficiaries would be trained, using these machines, so they could learn practical skills that would be transferable as they entered the work force. Copyright PUNCH.
