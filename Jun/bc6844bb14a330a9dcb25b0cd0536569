A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, says Nigeria has already broken up spiritually and if some drastic actions are not taken, the physical manifestation of the break up will soon become evident. Mailafia, who stressed that he believes in one indivisible Nigeria, spoke on Friday while featuring on a PUNCH Live interview programme. The Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the last election also said there was no contest in the fact that Nigeria has been a failed state for over five years. There have been agitations in Southern Nigeria with some persons clamouring for Yoruba Nation, Biafra Republic, amongst other typologies and nomenclature used by secessionists. Some of the secessionists have cited the growing insecurity, worsening economy, discrimination, ethnic prejudice, lack of justice, fairness and equity, especially in the distribution of resources, appointments into high government offices, amongst others, as reasons for wanting a nation of their own. When asked on Friday of his view on the secessionists’ calls in the country, Mailafia said, “Do you want a honest answer or do you want a political answer? The honest answer is that the country is already broken up spiritually. “Talk to any Nigerian. Do Nigerians feel that they are part of the same country right now? We have become strangers to each other. “It is just like marriages. People start fighting each other and the other one doesn’t see anything good in the other. The divorce only comes much later but, in the spirit, you would have divorced a long time ago before the ramshackle marriage ends up in the court where they sign papers for divorce.”
