Dangote Industries Limited said on Thursday that its President and Chief Executive Officer, Aliko Dangote, received the highest civilian honour in the Republic of Cameroon. The President of Cameroon, Paul Biya, conferred the honour on Dangote in recognition of his efforts in infrastructural development in the country and on the rest of the continent through his cement plants, according to a statement. Biya commended Dangote for his industrialisation moves as it had provided thousands of direct and indirect employment in their various locations and boosted their economies. He urged him to invest more in the Cameroonian manufacturing sector, saying his government was focused on promoting a business-friendly environment to make the country more attractive to investors. Dangote appreciated the Cameroonian government for the award and commended the efforts of the government towards providing an enabling environment. He was quoted as saying, “We have plans to expand our investment to other sectors beginning with oil and gas while our capacity in cement will be expanded. “At the inception of our construction activities at the plant, we encountered several challenges, but the government stepped in and ensured that we overcame these initial problems. Also, the incentives by the government to investors are encouraging.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
