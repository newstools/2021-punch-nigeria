The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, restrained the Ondo State Government from investigating the state’s Chief Judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, over a viral video made by a citizen of the state, Olupelumi Fagboyegun. Justice Inyang Ekwo declared that attempts or actual investigation by the Attorney General of the Federation, Ondo State Governor, Attorney General of Ondo State and Ondo State House of Assembly to investigate the chief judge were null and void. Justice Akeredolu had sued the Attorney General of the Federation, National Judicial Council, Ondo State Governor, Attorney General of Ondo State, Ondo State House of Assembly, and the Inspector General of Police, as the first to sixth defendants respectively, in Suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/2016/2021 The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants plotted to remove her as the Chief Judge of Ondo State over the viral video. In the viral video, Fagboyegun accused Justice Akeredolu of using her office as the Chief Judge to ensure his prolonged detention. The Abuja court, relying on Section 292 (2)(b) of the constitution held that only the NJC had the power to recommend the removal of a judicial officer to the governor, adding that the defendants lacked the legal capacity to conduct any investigation into the office of the Chief Judge as they were not constitutionally empowered to do so. The court ruled that the plaintiff, “by her office as the Chief Judge of Ondo State, falls within the disciplinary capacity of the National Judicial Disciplinary Regulation and so her claim succeeds.” The counsel for Justice Akeredolu, Onyinye Jedidiah, said, “I am glad that we approach the court for justice, and justice is served.” Copyright PUNCH.
