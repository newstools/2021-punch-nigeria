The Lagos judicial panel has awarded the sum of N10m to the family of  the late Kolade Johnson. Johnson was shot during a raid by police officers at Onipetesi area in Lagos, while watching an English premiership match between Tottenham and Manchester United on March 31, 2019, The Cable reported. The incident sparked outrage on social media, after which the police authorities identified Ogunyemi Olalekan, a police inspector, and Godwin Orji, a sergeant, as the officers involved in the shooting. Following an orderly trial, Olalekan was dismissed from the force after he was found guilty, while Orji was acquitted. Chairman of the Lagos panel, Doris Okuwobi, announced the compensation at the sitting on Friday. The award was received by the mother of the deceased. Thirteen petitioners — including Johnson’s family — were compensated with a total of N83m at the sitting on Friday.
