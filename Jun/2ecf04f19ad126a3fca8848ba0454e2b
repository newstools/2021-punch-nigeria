Newly-promoted Serie A side Venezia have officially announced the signing of Benfica and Nigeria right-back Tyronne Ebuehi after he passed a routine medical on Monday, The PUNCH reports. It’s the second consecutive loan spell for Ebuehi, having spent last season with Dutch Eredivisie side FC Twente, where he scored once and provided one assist in 34 Eredivisie appearances. He joins Venezia on a season loan deal from Benfica, with the Italians holding an option to buy him permanently if they are not relegated from Serie A after the 2021/22 campaign. Ebuehi becomes the club’s third major signing after the arrival of LASK left-back David Schnegg and Maccabi Tel Aviv midfielder Dor Peretz. Venezia earned promotion from Serie B via the playoff final, beating Cittadella 2-1 on aggregate, to gain promotion alongside Empoli and Salernitana. The 25-year-old has been capped 10 times by Nigeria and was a member of the Super Eagles squad to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
