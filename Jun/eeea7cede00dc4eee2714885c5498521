The Ogun State Government has warned residents against locating poultry, piggery and other forms of livestock farming within residential areas. The government on Sunday said the warming was to prevent environmental pollution. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Tunji Odunlami, said this in Abeokuta. Odunlami said, “It is illegal to operate poultry, piggery and others in residential areas. Human beings and animals cannot reside in the same area. Henceforth, such facility will be shut; there are areas designated for agricultural purposes which are already indicated in the regional plan of the state.” He appealed to residents to alert the government if such illegality was discovered in their neighbourhood, adding that appropriate actions would be taken. Odunlami also admonished real estate developers to desist from advertising landed property for sale without government approved layout. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
