A former Central Bank Governor, Prof. Charles Soludo, on Tuesday, won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance. The Primary was conducted at the Prof. Dora Akunyili Women Development Centre, Awka by the Chief Victor Oye -ed faction of the party. Soludo polled 740 votes to defeat three other aspirants, Okwudili Ezenwankwo who scored 41 votes, Damian Okolo seven votes, and Ibeh Kenechukwu Christopher who got four votes. The Chief Returning Officer of the APGA, Deacon Samson Olalere, said a total of 812 delegates were billed to participate in the election but 795 votes were accredited, while 792 delegates Obiano, who is the party’s BoT Chairman, in his speech, thanked the party delegates for the peaceful conduct during the election, noting that Soludo would win the November 6 governorship election in the state. Soludo, in his speech, described his emergence as divine, assuring that his administration would consolidate Obiano’s achievement to effect good governance in the state. He offered hands of fellowship to other aspirants, asking them to unite for the battle ahead in November. APGA had last week disqualified five aspirants of the party; Nze Akachukwu Nwankpo, Nonso Smart Okafor, Chukwuma Umeoji, Carter Dike Umeh, and Ozoka Odera Ifeanyi due to various reasons including insubordination to the party’s leadership, certificate mutilation, alteration of forms, among others.
