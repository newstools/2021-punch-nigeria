The Enugu Catholic Diocese has banned the Spiritual Director Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria, Rev’d Fr. Ejike Mbaka, from commenting on partisan politics. The ban our correspondent gathered was contained in a letter his Bishop, Most Rev Callistus Onaga, conveyed to him after his penance. Also contained in the said letter was converting the adoration ministry to chaplaincy to allow the diocese direct control of Adoration Ministry. A source from the Bishop’s Court told our correspondent that by implications of the development, Mbaka will no longer solely oversee the activities of the ministry as its spiritual director, as making it chaplaincy, brings it under the control of the Enugu Diocese and gives the bishop the power to appoint a chaplain to oversee its operations. The bishop further stated that he can appoint any ministerial officer “to assist the chaplains to oversee the pastoral activities of the ministry.” These directives were announced following Mbaka’s resumption to church activities of the ministry which was suspended following his one-month private retreat.
