Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has bemoaned the unavailability of some of his key players for Friday’s international friendly against Cameroon in Austria. The Eagles will also play the Indomitable Lions four days later at the same venue. Rohr initially selected a 31-man squad, before reducing the list of players to 23 last week. However, that number has been dwindling over the last few days, leaving Rohr scrambling to find replacements in time for the game. Victor Osimhen, Kenneth Omeruo, Sadiq Umar, Frank Onyeka, Victor Osimhen, Semi Ajayi, Kevin Akpoguma, Zaidu Sanusi, Moses Simon, Simy Nwankwo, Ola Aina and Tyrone Ebuehi all pulled out of the game. Captain Ahmed Musa and striker Paul Onuachu arrived at the Eagles camp on Wednesday morning to complete Rohr’s 20-man squad for the doubleheader. Both players joined the other 18 players in training at the training pitch of the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in Vienna. Speaking after the team’s training, Franco-German Rohr said, “We will try to have a good team with the 20 players we have; Cameroon has 26 players. The training session was okay, we had good grass and good weather and I think we can use these friendlies to prepare well. “This is a test match, you see that so many players are not here and it’s an opportunity for us to try other players and see new faces who will have the chance to show themselves. It is always important to prepare for the World Cup qualifiers, and this is the last opportunity we have before playing Liberia and Cape Verde. So, we must use this opportunity to be ready and have a good team.” The PUNCH had reported that 11 players pulled out of the Eagles squad, putting doubts on the friendlies. Copyright PUNCH.
