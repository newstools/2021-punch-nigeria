The Cross River State Police Command has arrested Inspector Nathaniel Manasseh for alleged gunrunning. Manasseh was paraded along with 24 other suspects arrested in connection with various crimes. The inspector was allegedly involved in gunrunning in Cross River and Imo states and had not been able to account for two AK-47 rifles, among others. Speaking with journalists on Tuesday, the Cross River State Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande, alleged that the inspector usually gave out rifles on ‘rent’ to notorious criminals. Manasseh, however, claimed that he was charmed and dispossessed of the AK-47 rifles, including a vehicle. He said, “I was charmed; I can’t really explain what happened and how they dispossessed me of the rifles. I am not a gunrunner.” The command also paraded 29-year-old Akaniyene Inyang Umoh for allegedly participating in the burning of the Ini police headquarters in Akwa Ibom State and escaping to Cross River, where he was arrested. The police commissioner, Akande, said since the new commander of the Anti-Kidnapping and Cultism Squad resumed, there had been a harvest of criminals. He said the police were determined to flush out all criminal elements from the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
