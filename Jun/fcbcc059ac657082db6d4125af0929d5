Rainoil Limited has assured the public of safety around the Ijegun-Egba community where its Liquefied Petroleum Gas depot is located, stating that there was no gas leak within its facility. In a statement issued by the company on Friday, the company said speculation and rumours of a gas leak on its facility were unfounded. Rainoil said it carried out a routine fire safety drill on Thursday to ensure the preparedness of its staff if an emergency ever happened. The company stated that a representative from the Department of Petroleum Resources was present to witness the entire process. The routine fire drill was apparently mistaken to be the result of a gas leak in the facility, the statement said. The company called on the community and other stakeholders to ignore the gas leakage rumour as the depot had since resumed operations following the fire safety drill. It was learnt that residents of the community had on Thursday raised an alarm about a gas leak coming from the Rainoil depot. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
