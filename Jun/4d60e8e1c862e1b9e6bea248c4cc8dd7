THE Kano State Pilgrims Welfare Board has suspended the induction course it started for the state intending pilgrims following the banning of pilgrims from Nigeria and other countries for 2021 Hajj. The Executive Secretary of the State Pilgrims Welfare Board, Alhaji Muhammad Abba-Danbatta made the disclosure in an interview with The PUNCH in Kano on Monday. He said even though the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria had yet to officially communicate the decision of the Saudi Arabian Government to the 36 states pilgrims welfare boards, Kano’s board found it necessary to suspend the induction course to avoid waste of resources and energy. Induction courses are usually organised by the boards for intending pilgrims to enlighten them on Hajj rites before the commencement of their trip. “The story prompted us to suspend the induction course we organised for the intending pilgrims at the 32 designated centres across the state. We are trying to meet the State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, on the issue to know the next line of action to be taken,” Abba-Danbatta said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
