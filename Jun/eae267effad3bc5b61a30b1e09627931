The All Progressives Congress has said plots by unpatriotic Nigerians to bring down the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), are bound to fail. National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said this at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, at the APC National Secretariat, in Abuja, on Thursday. He said, “Plans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail, some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down. “President Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail. “Those who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah.” According to him, in spite of the challenges the party met on the ground, the President has succeeded in recording huge successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty among Nigerians. Akpanudoedehe noted that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria’s poor and vulnerable was being under reported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party members nor did they share in the administration’s vision. He also explained that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible. The party secretary maintained that the sim card registration which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered cards available for use for criminal purposes has gone a long way in improving the nation’s economy.
