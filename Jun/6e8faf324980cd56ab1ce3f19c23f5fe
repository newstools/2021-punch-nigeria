IGBOs under the aegis of the Adamawa State chapter of Igbo Cultural Association, have bemoaned the sudden death of a former Presidential Adviser, Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, who was assassinated in Owerri, Imo State, last week. President of the cultural association, Chief Fidelis Umeh, expressed ICA’s grief over the demise of the late politician, on Saturday, telling reporters soon after the visit, that Igbo’s living in the state had no fear for their safety as was being speculated in some quarters. Gulak’s murder had raised fears of a possible reprisal, in parts of the North. Umeh further said, “Adamawa has been a peaceful state, where we sleep with our two eyes closed. We have not had anything like that (threat) and we don’t pray for such. That is why we should come and condole and show our sympathies that we are one.” Umeh was accompanied on the visit by other leaders representing various associations and groups under ICA, they include: Vice President ICA, Chief Emmanuel Onwuozor, Celestine Okoroafor, Chief Chidi Kalu-Ukwu and Sunday Nnaji.
