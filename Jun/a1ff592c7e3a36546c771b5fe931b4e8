THE Kaduna State chapter of the Arewa Consultative Forum has cautioned the state government over market demolition in the state. Although the organisation commended the state for its foresight to improve the markets, but noted that demolition would negatively affect the economic status of owner and lead to insecurity in the state. “The challenges are enormous which include displacements of individuals, rendering them economically vulnerable, which may result in increased insecurity in the state,” the ACF stated in a communiqué shortly after its meeting in Kaduna on Saturday. According to the communiqué by the state Publicity Secretary, Shehu Samaila, the government should consider some form of reliefs to displaced individuals either by considering allocations of alternative business places or some form of compensations where necessary before the exercise. The communiqué read by the Chairman,  Alhaji Lawal Meyere, acknowledged that the state under Malam Nasir El-Rufai was gradually restoring the past glory of the state. It added that the paramount of the challenges threatening progress in the state, “distracting the farming culture and food production of the state and subsequently negatively affecting the economic status of individual citizens as well as the state in general is insecurity.” Consequently, the ACF urged the state government to remodel the state vigilante group, equipped them to achieve the desired objective. It also frowned on payment of ransom to kidnappers, noting that doing so would further embolden the hoodlums. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
