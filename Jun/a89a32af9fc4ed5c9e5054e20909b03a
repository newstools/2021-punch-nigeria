The Directorate of Citizens Rights, Lagos State Ministry of Justice, has rescued an 11- year-old girl, who was allegedly assaulted by her 61-year-old father.

A statement by the Public Affairs Officer, Directorate of Citizens Rights, Taiwo Ade-Balogun, disclosed that the assault on the girl occurred on several occasions before it was reported.
