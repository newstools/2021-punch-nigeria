CAN directed that prayers for Sunday June 20, 2021 would hold during Sunday church service in each of the local churches, while that of Monday June 21, 2021 would hold 5pm in the churches , adding that that of Tuesday June 22, 2021 would hold at 4pm at a public place in the local government area. CAN further direct that on the third day of the fasting and prayer (Tuesday), members of all churches would assemble at a yet to be chosen venue. According to CAN, all pastors and worshipers are requested to attend the Tuesday gathering and hand over the letter which they lay for two nights in their altar to the LGA CAN coordinator “who would, with fathers of faith, say the final prayer for Christians’ victory over the plot.” The letter read in parts said, “Recall that when Hezekiah, King of Judah received such letter from Assyrian King, Sennacherib, Hezekiah took the letter to the temple in Jerusalem and laid it before God (2kings 19:14-15). “The state CAN under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit requests all churches and Christains’in Delta State to commence a three-day fasting and prayer for God’s intervention.” Copyright PUNCH.
