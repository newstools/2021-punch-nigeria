NO fewer than 1.2 million pupils were enrolled into the National Homegrown School Feeding Programme in Kano State. A Focal Person, National Social Investment Programme (N-SIP), Mr Baba Zubairu, made the disclosure at the distribution of engagement letters and tablets to some Trained Independent Monitors in Kano on Tuesday. He disclosed that a total of 119,000 households were registered under the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme where each of the identified poor households received N5,000 monthly. He added that Kano State had the highest number of N-Power beneficiaries across the country. He said all such programmes were introduced to actualise the vision of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty. In his remark, the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, commended the ministry for its efforts at improving the living condition of Nigerians. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
