Traders from the Agboju Plank and Building Materials Market, on Wednesday, protested the demolition of their business place at the Federal Housing Authority office in Festac Town. It was gathered that the Lagos State Government Task Force, on Sunday, demolished the popular Agboju Market and other ‘illegal’ buildings in Festac Town. Speaking to the press, the secretary of the plank sellers association, Afolabi Azeez, said the market has been in existence for 27 years and a majority of the businesses were being run on loans. “That place was swampy and we filled it with over 1,400 tippers of sand. Most of us rely on loans to run our business. We collect loans from banks and LAPO,” he said. He further revealed that a notice was passed to the traders prior to the demolition and the traders responded to the notice, only for them to see their markets being demolished. “We are seeking assistance. We want to remain there. Whatever they want us to pay, we are going to pay. We have been paying it before.” Azeez stated that traders in the market pay all their dues and taxes, and as such, should be allowed to remain in the market. “We have a right to that place. We seek help from the FHA so that they can help us retain that place,” he lamented.
