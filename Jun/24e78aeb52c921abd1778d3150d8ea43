Some Nigerians on social media have criticised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on his medical trip to London as doctors’ strike loom. Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Thursday disclosed that the President will on Friday proceed to London for “a scheduled medical follow-up.” However, Buhari leaves for London at a time of looming threats of industrial action from the National Association of Resident Doctors. NARD had on Thursday issued a fresh four-week ultimatum to the federal and state governments to address its demands including the payment of hazard allowances. Therefore, Buhari’s scheduled medical follow-up has come with a lot of criticisms from Nigerians on Twitter. A tweep, @akinolaanthony4, wrote, “Many Nigerians died because of the failed health care system, as they cannot travel abroad for treatments. They cannot even afford a dollar for their daily meals due to the level of poverty. This is a woefully failed government oiling Nigerians’ heads with bad luck.” Another tweep @ dwaynecarterdon, referred to the President as a “leader who does not patronize homemade (doctors) but forcing citizens to do so.” “Can’t they bring the equipment into Nigeria, and the ‘special’ doctors fly in to see him? It will save taxpayers’ money and also, the hospital can help other Nigerians with like ailments,” @namdi95748363 suggested. @sasanni99 tweeted, “You all think these people care. During the campaign, they promised Nigerians London/American standard hospitals to save revenue. So do we even have Ghana standard now?” @monnyx4  also tweeted, “Buhari leaves for check up in the UK while health workers in his country are threatening to strike. I wonder the fate of the poor. Someone will come out and defend him for this irresponsible action, it’s a pity” “What an irony! Clearly, no Nigerian doctor can treat Buhari,” @imohrich exclaimed.
