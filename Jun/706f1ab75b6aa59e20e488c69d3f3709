The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has ordered security and intelligence agencies to hasten their moves to rescue the 200 children kidnapped from an Islamic school in Niger State. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made this known on Monday in a statement titled, ‘Expedite action towards release of school children, President Buhari urges law enforcement officials.’ According to the statement, the President, who had been briefed on the latest incident of school kidnapping, condemned the act, describing it as “unfortunate.” He, therefore, charged all the agencies involved in the rescue operation to do their utmost in securing their immediate release. Buhari also directed the concerned government agencies to extend possible support to the families of the children involved.
