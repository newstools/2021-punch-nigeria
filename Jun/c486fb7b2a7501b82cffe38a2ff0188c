A protest over the hike in tuition fee by the College of Education, Gidan Waya in Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna, has claimed a student’s life while another was injured by security operatives. The college is located in Southern Kaduna. An eyewitness told our correspondents that security operatives were called from Kafanchan shortly after the commencement of what he describes as a “peaceful” protest which later turned violent. According to the eyewitness who pleaded anonymity, the security operatives fired live bullets to disperse the students. He said the students blocked the major highway in front of the school thereby preventing the free flow of traffic, forcing motorists off the road. Alexander Kure, Provost of the College, confirmed the incident on Monday. According to him, the school was shut down on Sunday and wonder why the students were still demonstrating about the school fee hike, noting that he wasn’t privy to the protest. The Provost said, “The incident happened on the highway and not inside the school. I was told by the security that one student was killed and another injured. “I offered an ambulance to take the corpse to the mortuary, and the other person that got injured to the hospital for treatment. “The school was shut down yesterday for mid-semester break and students are to resume next Monday. “I don’t know why they were protesting. The school was closed and we heard there was a protest on the road, and I am not privy to happenings outside the school.”
