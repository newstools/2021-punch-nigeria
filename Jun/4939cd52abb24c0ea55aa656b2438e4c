The board of the Hydrocarbon Pollution and Remediation has said 70 per cent of the clean-up of impacted sites in Ogoni land, Rivers State, will now be managed by the United Nations Environment Programme. A member on the board of HYPREP and prominent Ogoni activities, Celestine Akpobari, disclosed this on Monday in Port Harcourt. Akpobari said before the change, UNEP was overseeing few aspects of the clean-up, adding that it was no longer in the hands of the HYPREP to decide the activities of the clean-up exercise. He recalled that the environmental report on the pollution in Ogoni land was undertaken by UNEP. “The report we are talking about was carried out by UNEP. So if they manage the clean-up, they will be able to say from now to three months’ time; we want to achieve this. “Imagine the last administration… they were supposed to spend $800m in four years. They ended up spending only about $30m. UNEP will not be like that,” he stated. Akpobari called for support from the people of Ogoni land for the new clean-up managers. “I want to assure our people that this time round some of the things they have been yearning to get will come to them without any struggle because it is their right,” he added.
