The Group Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief of Champion Newspapers, Dr Nwadiuto Iheakanwa, said that the award was targeted at acknowledging the contributions of outstanding individuals, organisations, agencies, and institutions to the development of Nigeria in particular, and humanity in general. In a statement on Tuesday, she said the company recognised the role the foundation played in uplifting the lives of indigent Nigerians who were helpless, especially during the COVID-19 shutdown in 2020. The chairman of the foundation, Dr. Etom Obi, expressed excitement and thanked God for the recognition of the foundation’s little efforts in service to humanity. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
