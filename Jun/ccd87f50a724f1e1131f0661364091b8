A cleric, William Ghattas, of the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem, Israel, has lit a candle for the late founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Temitope Joshua. A statement on Wednesday said the candle was lit to pray for the late Joshua. Recall that on Saturday June 5, 2021, the prophet died at the age of 57. The statement from SCOAN reads partly, “Since Prophet TB Joshua’s passing onto glory, the official Facebook page of the ministry increased by 500,000 followers, making a total of 6.1 million followers. More than 1 million online tributes from across the world honour the man who touched every level of society. “All across the world, from Bethlehem to Russia to Pakistan, candlelight vigils were held in honour of Prophet TB Joshua. William Ghattas, in charge of the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem lit a candle in the historic grotto of the Church of the Nativity, the birthplace of Jesus Christ to pray for his soul to rest in peace.” The church restated its earlier announcement that it was preparing for the week-long service from 5th to 11th July 2021 “in honour of Prophet TB Joshua’s life and legacy, which will be broadcast live on Emmanuel TV. He will be laid to rest at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria. “We want to assure you that nothing will stop the work of God at The SCOAN from moving on.” Copyright PUNCH.
