Ultimate Fighting Championship middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya, is confident of returning to winning ways when he faces Italian contender, Marvin Vettori, at the Gila River Arena in Arizona. It is the second time both fighters will be facing themselves in the UFC with Adesanya running out victorious via split decision in their first meeting in April 2018, which was the Nigerian’s second outing in the UFC franchise. Both fighters have had heated conversations on social media and during press conferences but Adesanya says he is ready to defend his title and rule the middleweight division after failing to secure the light heavyweight title from Poland’s Jan Blachowicz last March. He also promised to send the Italian to the floor in the second round. “In the second round you’re going to hit the floor. You’re going to be sniffing the floor with that plastered nose on the left side of your face. “I’ll tell you this thing, this weekend you won’t need the judges,” Adesanya replied told Vettori referring to their split decision fight three years ago. “We got (dissenting judge) Chris Lee out of there, but this weekend you won’t need the judges. “Honestly speaking, since we last fought, you can look at the stack of people he’s fought and the stack of people I’ve fought — there’s a vast difference,” Adesanya said.
