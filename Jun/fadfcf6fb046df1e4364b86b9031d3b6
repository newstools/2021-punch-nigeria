The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria has condemned efforts to weaken the relevance of the profession in public governance through retrogressive policy by the Federal Government. A statement from ICAN on Tuesday, said the new President of ICAN, Mrs Comfort Eyitayo, said this during her acceptance speech at the institute in Lagos. She said, “We are challenged not only by the harsh economic circumstances of our nation, but also, by pieces of regulations designed to diminish the importance of professionalism in public governance. “The office of the Head of Service of the Federation on April 12, 2021 issued a circular to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies stopping the use of professional qualifications as entry qualifications into the civil/public service of the federation with immediate effect. “The circular affirmed that professional qualifications will only be an added advantage in the interim, if a civil servant is to be promoted from salary grade level 13 to 14.” Eyitayo stated that the move by the Federal Government would restrict opportunity of some sections of the country from working in government. She worried that the “Children of the poor who could not obtain formal education due to financial challenges but decided, out of determination, to pursue professional qualifications through private studies are barred from working in government. “To accept a post-primary qualification for entry into the civil/public service and disparage professional qualifications as not an acceptable qualification for the same purpose, is to hold in contempt the Acts of parliament which set up the various professional bodies. In our view, this is not healthy for national development. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
