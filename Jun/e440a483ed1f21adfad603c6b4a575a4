Super Falcons captain Asisat Oshoala missed the team’s 1-0 defeat to Jamaica at this year’s Summer Series – a four-nation tournament in the United States of America due to a visa hitch, The PUNCH reports. Houston Dash forward Deneisha Blackwood scored the only goal of the encounter at the BBVA Stadium, Houston, Texas in the 54th minute to end the Falcons’ unbeaten run of eight games. Barcelona forward Oshoala, who made history last season as the first African winner of the European Women’s Champions League remains a doubt for the Falcons’ next game against Portugal in the early hours of Sunday. The 26-year-old scored 15 goals as Barcelona retained the Primera Division title, to add to the Spanish Cup and Super Cup. According to Falcons coach Randy Waldrum, two players will arrive at camp on Saturday, while he also added that there were plans to get Oshoala, four-time African Women’s Footballer of the Year, in camp. “We hope to see two more players in camp tomorrow (today) ahead of our next game,” Waldrum said. When asked about the possibility of Oshoala joining the squad, the American replied,” Not yet, but we hope so. We are trying but it’s the visa issue. She will make a huge difference if she’s here.”
