One of the persons arrested for vandalism during the last #EndSARS protest in Ondo State, Kemisola Oguniyi, has reportedly given birth in the prison custody. The 18-year-old girl was arrested, along three others – Ayodele Bukunmi, Ojo Samuel and Ani Obinna, during the crisis and had been remanded in the correctional centre in Ondo town, Ondo State. It was gathered that the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit felony, arson, riotous assembly, stealing and malicious damage. Ogunniyi was said to have delivered a baby boy on June 16, 2021. In a letter to the Ondo Chief Judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, the lawyer of the detainee, Mr Tope Tomekun said his client was innocent of the charges preferred against her. According to him, Ogunniyi was on her way to the Federal University of Technology, Akure, on the day to collect money for her mother’s treatment when she was apprehended by the men of the Nigerian Army, who later handed her over to the police. He said, “She was later alleged to be part of those who set the APC Secretariat, Akure, on fire during the EndSARS protest that took place in October 2020. “I write to you sir, first as a lawyer and in furtherance of my conviction as a believer in humanitarian cause of justice, to appeal to you sir, that for the sake of the sinless newborn baby and in the interest of justice, to give directive that this matter be given an urgent hearing.” Copyright PUNCH.
