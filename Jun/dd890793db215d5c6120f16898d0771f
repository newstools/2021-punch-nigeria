Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomosho, has inducted 81 graduates from the institution’s faculty of Nursing into the profession. The acting Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Mojeed Liasu, admonished the nurses to adhere to the ethics of their profession. Liasu said the university had provided adequate equipment for its nursing programme, saying the gesture was geared towards producing graduates that could compete with their counterparts from other parts of the world. He said, “LAUTECH has continued to meet the standard and requirements of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria, and the university as seen today, will continue to live up to its responsibility of churning out qualified nurses for the benefit of the nation and the world. “As a university that is saddled with the responsibility of providing the highest level of manpower in this country, we shall relentlessly continue to strive for the best in providing research and training for our students to make them relevant globally.” The Registrar, NMCN, Alhaji Farouk Umar, represented by Mr Emmanuel Odomtre, administered oath on the new nurses and affirmed them as registered Nurses.
