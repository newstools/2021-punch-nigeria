The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, will attend the Akada Children’s Book Festival scheduled to hold from 1st – 3rd July 2021. Ferguson will do a book reading on Saturday, the final day of the event. The Akada Children’s Book Festival is an annual book reading event that showcases children’s book authored by African writers from diverse cultures. Organisers of the event include the Clever Clogs Book, the British Council, and a number of other reputable organisations. During its maiden edition in 2019, the event attracted over 1,400 attendees at the British Council premises in Lagos. However, this year’s edition will be held virtually and will run for three consecutive days. The first day of the event, July 1, is set aside for writers, Illustrators, publishers and editors while the second day is for parents and teachers. The final day will usher in the Children’s Day celebration at the festival, packed with loads of activities from 8am till 8pm. This year’s event is free and open for all, but requires registration to attend. To join the festival, visit akadafestival.org
