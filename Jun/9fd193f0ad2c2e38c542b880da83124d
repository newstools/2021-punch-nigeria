Plans for the recruitment of 600 qualified graduates and Persons Living With Disabilities into the federal civil service have reached an advanced stage, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Disability, Dr Samuel Ankali, has said. Ankali spoke on Saturday at the School for the Blind in Jabi, Abuja, during the donation of COVID-19 Braille awareness materials to the Nigeria Association of the Blind, FCT chapter, as part of the continuation of an inclusive campaign. The campaign, sponsored by the Federal Government, United Nations and European Union is implemented by the Centre for Communication and Social Impact. Ankali said, “The greatest achievement we have made, historically, is the Law on Discrimination against PWDs. We are interested in getting people with disabilities engaged in the federal civil service. “We are just improving on what we have already done. We wrote, made special requests and recommendations to the federal civil service, Head of Service, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), his Chief of Staff and Secretary to the Government of the Federation. The response was fantastic. A lot of them have reported and have resumed for work.” The Head of Risk Communication and Community Engagement at the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, Dr Yahaya Disu, advised that members of NAB should continue to follow the COVID protocol to turn the curve on the pandemic. At the event, the Programme Officer at CCSI, Adenike Ayodele, said the PLWDs were a core of the people that should receive information about COVID-19, as they were strategic to the campaign.
