The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will not tolerate any form of harm or pain inflicted on women or minors in the state by sex violators, noting that the government will be ruthless with gender-based violence offenders. Obaseki stated this at a dinner party organised in honour of the Nigerian Academy of Science, at the Government House, Benin City. According to the governor, “I feel sorry for anybody who gets entangled or accused of gender-based violence; he will know that Edo has no space for such acts. You can mess around everywhere else, but not in Edo. “We take this offence seriously; we forbid it in Edo for you to harm our women or minors because you have the strength and you have the energy to dominate or oppress them.  I want to assure you that Edo will continue to blaze the trail, particularly in the area of protecting its citizens.” He continued, “For us as a government, our emphasis is on our people to be safe and protected. We are creating an environment that allows our people to express themselves and become who they have been ordained by God to be. “Our role as a government is to free our people from fear and threats, and ensure that they are able to express themselves creatively. We don’t just want the dominance of anybody.”
