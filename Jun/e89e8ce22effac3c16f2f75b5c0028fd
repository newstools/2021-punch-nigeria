The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has told newly sworn in chairmen of the 23 local government areas of the state not to approach any financial bank to borrow money without first clearing with the state government. The governor gave the warning shortly after the elected chairmen took their oath of office at the Banquet Hall of the Government House, Port Harcourt, on Thursday. Wike, in a statement issued by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, said the caution became necessary in order to stem the unguarded desire of some council chairmen to access money without any developmental plan. He was quoted to have said, “Don’t go and borrow money without the state government’s approval. Some of you tried it the last time and started with your blackmail, saying help us, we are finished. You have no authority to go and borrow money.” Wike also charged the council chairmen to pay attention to issues of security in order to stem likely security breaches in their various areas. The governor particularly urged them to establish a robust working relationship both with the Divisional Police Officers and the traditional rulers, which would engender regular security meetings for proper briefings. “Stay in your council areas. Don’t stay in hotels and in Port Harcourt. If you’re not at home, how do you know about the security situation in your local government?  Security is key. “Relate with your DPOs. It does not cost you anything. It is only when you have a problem that you relate with your DPOs and some of them are intelligent and when you call them that time, they turn their faces the other way. You must make efforts to relate with your DPOs,” the governor said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
