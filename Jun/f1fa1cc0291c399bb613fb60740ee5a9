The Netherlands beat Austria 2-0 on Thursday to book a place in the last 16 of Euro 2020 in their first major tournament for seven years. Wing-back Denzel Dumfries starred for the Dutch in Amsterdam, winning an 11th-minute penalty, which was scored by Memphis Depay, and netting the other goal himself midway through the second half. Frank de Boer’s Netherlands only need a point from their final Group C game against North Macedonia — who became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament — on Monday to finish top. (AFP)
