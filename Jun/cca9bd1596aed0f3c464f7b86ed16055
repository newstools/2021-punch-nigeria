Nigerians on social media have started a new challenge tagged #onidurochallenge, after ace gospel singer, Tope Alabi, criticised the popular gospel song. A video made rounds on the Nigerian digital space on Saturday where Alabi criticised the popular Christian song, Oniduro Mi, which was sung by iconic singers, Tolu Adelegan and Yinka Alaseyori, at different times. In the Yoruba language, Oniduro Mi simply means guarantor or support system. More so, the song exalts God as a guarantor and one who never forsakes His own. While commenting on the song, Alabi noted that God was more than a guarantor to her as she further said that there was a time she wanted to sing the song but the Holy Spirit cautioned her against doing so. Since the video went viral, Alabi has received knocks from celebrities and other Nigerians on social media for criticising the song. A tweep, @Tutsy22, wrote, “Tope Alabi publicly condemned Yinka Alaseyori’s Onídùró mi song, but God changed the criticism to free PR.” Well, that is no far from the case as Nigerians on social media have begun the #onidurochallenge, where people have been uploading videos of themselves singing the song. Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe, and gospel artiste, Shola Allyson, have jumped on the challenge as both of them uploaded videos of themselves singing the song. Other Nigerians on Instagram and Twitter have also taken up the challenge, uploading videos and write-ups with the hashtag #onidurochallenge. As of the time of the report, the hashtag #onidurochallenge has 100+ posts on Instagram.
