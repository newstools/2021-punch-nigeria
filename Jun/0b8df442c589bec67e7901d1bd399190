Irate fans attacked players of Nigeria Professional Football League side, Enyimba, and injured some of them after the visitors held home side Plateau United to a goalless draw in Jos, in a match-day 29 fixture on Sunday. Enyimba midfielder Dare Olatunji and goalkeeper Sabirou Bassa-Djeri sustained wounds following the attack. The chaos started in the 90th minute, when Enyimba defender, Timothy Danladi was issued a red card for a foul, but as he exited the stadium, angry fans hurled objects at the player with Enyimba coach; Fatai Osho’s pleas falling on deaf ears. Fans of the home team were also angered after the centre referee waved play on following pleas from Plateau United players for a penalty. The fans then invaded the pitch and ran after the match officials, but the security officials on duty protected the referee and his assistants, who remained in the centre of the pitch. An Enyimba official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The PUNCH, “Our player, Timothy Danladi, was sent off in added time and that was where it all started. Missiles were directed at him as he made his way into the dressing room. “It got worse at full time as the fans hurled stones, pieces of wood and everything they could lay hands on on our team. “Many players and officials were hit in the mayhem, but Djeri-Bassa and Dare Olatunji were the ones that got injured.” Plateau United captain, Elisha Golbe, led his teammates to appeal to the fans, who remained adamant and pelted Enyimba players with objects as they made their way to the dressing room. The angry fans, according to an eyewitness, also attacked Plateau United coach Abdu Maikaba, because he failed to claim all three points at stake.
