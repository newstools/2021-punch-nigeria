The Peoples Democratic Party has condemned the murder of the Special Adviser to the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, the late AIG Christopher Dega (retd.), by unknown gunmen. The opposition party described the murder of the late policeman as barbaric. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘PDP Alarmed Over Killing of Dega, Ortom’s Security Adviser,’ signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Wednesday. Dega was assassinated by yet-to-be-identified assailants in a restaurant in Bukuru, Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State. Ologbondiyan said, “The PDP, in very strong terms, condemns the murder of AIG Dega (retd.), describing it as barbaric as well as ominous, given the recent attempts on the life of Governor Ortom, by terrorists and bandits marauding various parts of Benue state.” The party described the late Dega as a very patriotic Nigerian and dutiful aide, ‘who gave his all in the service of our dear fatherland and his home state, Benue.” The PDP charged the police to immediately go into action and follow the leads to apprehend and bring the assailants and their backers to justice. The party also called on the President to end his lethargic approach to security matters and take decisive steps to end the activities of terrorists, bandits and vandals, who have been emboldened by his administration’s body language and overt failure. It prayed for the repose of the soul of the deceased.
