The Governing Board of the National Examinations Council has approved the appointment of Mr Ebikibina John Ogborodi as the acting Registrar/Chief Executive of the Council. The appointment followed the death of the Registrar, Prof Godswill Obioma, on Monday after a brief illness. Until his appointment, Ogborodi was the Director of Special Duties in the council. A circular issued by the Director, Human Resource Management, Mr Mustapha Abdul, explained that the appointment was endorsed by the Governing Board at its emergency meeting held on Wednesday. The circular explained that Ogborodi’s appointment was as a result of his being the most senior director and stated that all activities of the council were to continue unabated as earlier planned. Ogborodi hails from the Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. He obtained his first degree from the University of Jos in 1986 and a Master’s degree in Learning Disability from the same university in 1999. He joined the service of NECO in 1999 and has served in different capacities. He was a former acting Director, Examination Development Department; acting Director, Office of the Registrar; Director, General Services; and Director, Human Resource Management, among others.
