The Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Captain Musa Nuhu, has said one of the challenges facing the aviation sector is the rapid change in technology. He said this at a virtual workshop, themed ‘Global megatrends and impact on aviation.’ According to him, there are several challenges in the aviation industry but the rate at which technology is advancing poses a difficulty. “One of the difficulties we are having is the rapid change in technology. The problem of getting people behind the scenes, the problem of getting people, training and retaining them,” Nuhu said. He explained that this was not a problem peculiar to Nigeria alone, as it was a global issue the aviation sector was facing. He also noted that no matter how difficult the rapid change in technology was, the use of technology by regulatory bodies was very important. Highlighting the importance of alliances between airlines, he said, “Airlines need to work together. We have seen two domestic airlines working together in Nigeria to form an alliance.” The President, Aviation Strategy International, Pierre Coutu, said operators in the aviation sector would need a new approach to their business models, including strategic planning and infrastructure/asset planning.
