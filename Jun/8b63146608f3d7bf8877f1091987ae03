The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has urged youths in the state to resist any attempt by “disgruntled persons” to sabotage government infrastructural projects in their domain. Wike spoke during the inauguration of 11.6 kilometre Omerelu internal roads in the Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state on Monday. The governor, in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, stated that the inauguration was a fulfillment of the campaign promise he made to the people of Omerelu when wanted to be governor of the State. “You promised me that when the election comes, that you will stand by us, that you will vote for us. Indeed, you voted for us. So, having fulfilled part of your own promise, we must also fulfil part of our own promise,” he stated. The governor regretted that despite the fact that one of the most influential commissioners in the immediate past administration was an indigene of Omerelu community, government neglected the community. Wike, who expressed concern that a community like Omerelu in this age lacked access roads, urged the youth to “resist any attempt by some unscrupulous persons to sabotage this road and other government projects in this area.” Copyright PUNCH.
