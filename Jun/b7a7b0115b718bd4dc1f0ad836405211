British-Nigerian Leicester player, Ashleigh Plumptre, has said that she is ready to embrace her Nigerian heritage, while stating her willingness to play for the Super Falcons if invited. Born to a Nigerian father and a British mother, Plumptre plays in the Women’s Super League for Leicester City and was voted Player Of The Season in the FA Women’s Championship 2020/2021. The 23-year-old hopes to play for the Super Falcons as a result of her father’s Nigerian roots, the BBC reported. “The idea of me being able to play for Nigeria, with that being an option, I would happily grab that with both hands,” she said. “Obviously, there’s a lot of things I can openly say that I don’t know about Nigerian culture but I want to learn because I know that it’s in me, and it’s in my sister and in my dad. “We can only get it from my grand-dad, he’s the only thing that we know in terms of Nigeria. I’ve obviously visited Nigerian relatives in America and in England. Plumptre pointed out that an opportunity to play for Nigeria would help other biracial footballers to follow suit. She said, “What it will mean for me as somebody who is British born but with Nigerian heritage is huge. People look at me and they think I’m tanned and that I’ve been on holiday, they don’t think that I’m Nigerian. “I think with football being my platform, I am using that as something that’s bigger than me, as much as I can resonate with my Nigerian heritage,” she added.
