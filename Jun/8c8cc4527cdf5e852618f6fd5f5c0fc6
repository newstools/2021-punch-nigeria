The Chairman of Akko Local Government Area of Gombe State, Abubakar Barambu, and others have threatened to sue Senator Danjuma Goje, who represents Gombe Central, should he refuse to seek re-election to the red chamber. Barambu, who claimed to be speaking for thousands of constituents, said this on Saturday while addressing members of the All Progressives Congress in Akko Township Stadium. Meanwhile, Goje, 68, had on December 8, 2019, during an empowerment programme he organised for his constituents, said he would not seek re-election. However, the senator is said to be a potential candidate for the National Chairman of the APC should the leadership be zoned to North-East. Speaking on Saturday, Barambu said the constituency had not been better represented than during the Goje era. “Even if you (Goje) doesn’t want to (seek re-election), we urge you to because if you don’t, we may institute a legal action forcing you (Goje) to contest the Gombe Central Senatorial seat. You have provided developmental leadership in your tenure in office,” he said. Also, a member representing Nafada/Dukku Constituency in the House of Representatives, Aishatu Dukku, urged Goje to rethink his decision to quit politics, adding that his contributions to polity were still needed. “He is so humane; he listens to his people; he supports his people. That is the type of leadership we want,” she said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
