The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has congratulated the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on his 56th birthday. Both Gbajabiamila and Sanwo-Olu share the same birth date. Both leaders will clock 56 and 59 on Friday (today), respectively. Gbajabiamila said the governor had proven to be a man of the people since he assumed office two years ago. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, Gbajabiamila noted that it was not a mere coincidence that he and the governor share the same birthday, adding that they had a lot in common, especially in the area of serving the people. He said, “We all thank God for the life of His Excellency, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, my birthday mate. Lagosians are proud of him, and indeed Nigerians are proud of him. I believe in the next two years, Lagos State will witness massive development much more than what we saw in the past two years.” Similarly, the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, in a message released by his media office on Thursday congratulated Babajide Sanwo-Olu, describing him as one who believed in the development and prosperity of the state. Obasa further commended Sanwo-Olu for the cordial relationship enjoyed by the executive and the legislative arms, adding that this had reflected in the successes achieved by the government. “Our dear State is proud to have had leaders who are passionate about its progress and you remain one of them,” Obasa said.
