24 hours after the Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party asked the state governor, Hope Uzodinma, to resign over rising insecurity in the state, the state government had said that the main opposition had indicted itself over the security situation of the state. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said that the statement credited to PDP was a self-indictment on their part. Emelumba said that by that utterance, PDP had admitted responsibility for insecurity challenges in the state. Emelumba recalled that right from the inception of the administration, of Hope Uzodimma, the PDP leaders, particularly a former Deputy Governor, Gerald Irona, had vowed to make the state ungovernable if they failed to get the review of the Supreme Court judgement on the governorship election in their favour. He said, “It was all over the social media, where the party leadership made this threat which was even on video, and it was never denied nor retracted. The PDP has been on a mission to actualising it evidenced by the organised protests they staged in the early stages of the Uzodimma administration. “The PDP never condemned the attacks on the correctional centre, the burnings of police stations and killings in the state, showing that they condoned the attacks. “PDP is condoning these attacks because it seems like they are playing a script and are very happy that they have reached the climax that is why they are issuing very illogical and unreasonable demands.” Responding, the PDP spokesperson in the state, Ogubundu Nwadike, said that the APC led government in the state had failed. He said, “We don’t need to join issues with a government that has failed in its primary duty of securing lives and property. Imo government should seek help on what is happening here. We insist that the governor should resign for incompetence.”
