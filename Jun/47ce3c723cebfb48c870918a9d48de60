SUPPORTERS of former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, under the aegis of a group, ‘Saraki is coming’, on Sunday stormed the streets of Kano, to demand that he contests the 2023 presidential race. The supporters, who were mostly youths, marched from the Kano City centre, to the Nigeria Union of Journalists’, Secretariat, displaying placards, with different inscriptions, some of which read: “Saraki is coming in 2023”, “Saraki is the answer.” President of the group, Umar Gado, alongside his Secretary, Saidu Sani, who spoke to journalists afterwards, apologised to Saraki for the hostility which followed his emergence as Senate President. Gado said, “We never knew that Bukola Saraki meant well for us, more specifically we the younger ones, not until he left office, we were convinced to hate him for no reasons, but we have regretted it and we say sorry sir. While appealing to Saraki to contest the presidency, he said, “We are not begging, we are not appealing, but are directing that you must contest the nation’s highest political seat, come 2023, that is our mindset and you have no other option than to listen to us”. The group said they will continue to mount pressure on Saraki until he accepts their calls to contest. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
