This is not a ‘better time’ for Nigerian iconic singer, Davido, as he has lost one of his allies to the cold hands of death. Earlier today, one of the singer’s close associates, Habeeb Uthman, fondly known as Obama DMW, reportedly drove himself to a Lagos hospital to complain of breathing difficulty and died hours later. While no official statement has been made, several members of the 30 BG gang have refused to comment on the death of Obama DMW. However, a close source revealed that Obama DMW had difficulty breathing and went to a hospital in Lekki, Lagos to get treated. Aside from being an associate of popstar, Davido, Obama DMW was also a music executive cum artiste manager and founded his music label Obama Music Worldwide (OMW).
