THE Indigenous People of Biafra has said it is not after northerners, but against terrorists. The Media and Publicity Secretary of the secessionist group, Emma Powerful, stated this on Thursday in a statement made available to our correspondent in Awka, Anambra State. The group, who was responding to Abubakar Gumi’s recent comment on IPOB as haters and killers of northerners, described the cleric’s comments as fallacious and mischievous. The group’s statement read, “The attention of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra  has been drawn to the latest ranting and ridiculous claims by terrorist apologist, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, that IPOB and Eastern Security Network were killing northerners. “ESN is a child of necessity created for the defence of our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen wreaking havoc across our communities. ESN is only defending our hapless mothers and sisters who have been raped, maimed and attacked without any justification by Fulani herdsmen. “No northern in any part of Biafra land can prove that he/she has at any time been attacked by IPOB or ESN. We are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
