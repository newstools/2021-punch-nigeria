A cardiologist at the Usman Danfodiyo University, Sokoto State, Prof. Simeon Isezuo, has advocated diet and lifestyle modification as part of the treatment regimen to control hypertension. Isezuo said this during a webinar organised by Neimeth International Pharmaceutical Plc to mark 2021 World Hypertension Day. The theme was, ‘Arresting Hypertension, The Silent Killer.’ In his presentation, titled, ‘Effective Hypertension Management – Current Trend,’ Isezuo said, “The development of high blood pressure in blacks is multifactorial involving interactions between obesity, salt sensitivity, among other causes. “The understanding of how these factors influence blood pressure will guide the development of treatment protocols and future therapy.” He recommended lifestyle modification as the integral part in the management of hypertension. The cardiologist added that the low salt dietary approach to stop hypertension plus diuretic and  calcium channel blockers were effective treatment in the management of hypertension. An ambassador of the pharmaceutical firm, Dr Kayode Adesola, in his presentation, titled, ‘Isolated Systolic Hypertension Refractory Hypertension and HBP Management Guidelines: The Role of Calcium Channel Blockers in Achieving BP Goals,’ said, “We need to pay more attention to people in the south east where about 61 per cent of their population experience hypertension.” Copyright PUNCH.
