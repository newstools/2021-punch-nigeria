The President of Egba Agura Lions’ Club, Mr Lanre Biobaku, has called for collaborative efforts by individuals and corporate bodies with the government for community development. He stated this on Tuesday while inaugurating a borehole project by the club at Oke-Ija Ofa in Gbagura, Abeokuta North local Government Area, Ogun State. The Agura of Gbagura, Oba Saburee Babajide Bakre, was represented at the event by his wife, Olori Omobolanle Bakre. Biobaku said, “It is better we teach the culture of philanthropy from infancy and change the orientation of our people from flamboyant life style. We have a lot to do in Nigeria; many prefer to keep their wealth in banks. We need to change our orientation and culture to value the development of the people.” Biobaku noted the challenge experienced by the service club while working on the borehole project. “It was a herculean task getting water out of the hilly top of Oke-Ija Ofa as other agencies including the World Bank that had made an attempt in the past avoided the area. The Lions Club was able to get it done after contracting the third engineer and we have decided that all our programme and activities will be geared towards the development of Gbagura,” he added. The District Governor of Lions Club, Lynda Odunmbaku, enjoined the people of the community to make judicious use of the water project, as well as encourage their sons and daughters to join service clubs to engender more development.
