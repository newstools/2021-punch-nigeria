A 50 year old man, Abdulkadir Abdulkarim, has been arrested by the Katsina State Police Command for alleged sexual assault of two female minors, aged three and five respectively. Abdulkarim, who was arrested on Friday, was paraded at the command’s headquarters, on Monday. The command’s spokesman, Gambo Isah,  told journalists that Abdulkarim, a resident of Modoji Quarters, confessed to “using his fingers”  on them. Abdulkarim attributed the act to the devil. Also paraded on Monday was an alleged fraudster who was said to have used his victims’ ATM to withdraw N1.6m . The suspect, Aliyu Abdullahi,21, was alleged to have frequently withdrawn the money from the accounts of  six victims before he was arrested on Monday. Isah said, “Suspect confessed to have withdrawn the sum N1,606,400,000 from different accounts of six of his victims.  Investigation is ongoing.” The command has also arrested 10 social miscreants, known as Kauraye.
