The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday, slammed Nigerians, saying they are “very forgetful” of the “achievements” of his regime in the last six years. He also said those who want to criticise him should do it objectively. Buhari, who spoke on Friday evening during an interview aired on NTA, said “this administration has tried” since it came into power in May 2015. When asked about the anti-graft fight of his government, Buhari said his administration has done relatively well in bringing corrupt politicians to book. He said, “Nigerians, I think, are very forgetful. I am very pleased that the majority of Nigerians think that this administration, under the circumstance, are (sic) doing their (sic) best but people who misappropriated funds are elected members either at state or federal level… “You can accuse them or try to prove that when they were elected members of the House of Reps and they are given ministries and so on, they had only one house and maybe a wife but now they have several houses may be in Abuja, maybe in Lagos, so, rarely, if you try to work out their legitimacy limit, viz-a-viz their expenditure, they will be exposed.” He also said there was the need for the establishment of specialised courts in the country to hasten the trial of corrupt politicians.
