The Special Adviser to the Ogun State Governor on Water Resources and Special Duties, Adekunle Otun, has said that the rehabilitation of a dam project in Arakanga Water Works, Abeokuta, is now completed. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Mr Femi Abati, he said that the development would lead to distribution of potable water to residents of the state capital with the distribution to be done gradually until the three senatorial districts had been covered. The statement said that the rehabilitation of the Arakanga dam which commenced in 2020 was to enable it to abstract enough water for treatment and replacement of pipes. It said that the rehabilitation of the dam necessitated the shutdown of other sub-stations, which would be restored as the dam gates had been successfully installed. “We are confident that the completion of Arakanga Water Works will make every home enjoy water supply, and this will be done bit by bit, until we ensure that all parts of the state have access to potable water supply”, he said. On the State Government’s effort to improve water supply, the Special Adviser said a memorandum of understanding was recently signed with the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, towards rehabilitating Ota Water Scheme in Ado-Odo Local Government Area. Otun added that the Ogun State Water Corporation had also fixed some boreholes and rehabilitated the Yemoji Water Scheme at Ijebu-Ode. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
