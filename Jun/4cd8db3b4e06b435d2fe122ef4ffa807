Suspected kidnappers on Tuesday abducted an octogenarian woman at Rijiyar Tsamiya village, in the Sandamu Local Government Area of Katsina State. According to residents, the victim is the mother of two popular businessmen, identified only as Alhaji Zubairu and Alhaji Kanunu, who are based in Daura. The PUNCH gathered that the suspected kidnappers, who came in two vehicles, stormed the village around 1.30am. It was further learnt that the gunmen only abducted the woman and did not take any item from her house. Attempts to speak to the two businessmen were unsuccessful, as they were said to have left the town shortly after receiving the news of their motherâ€™s abduction. A family source said as of Tuesday, the kidnappers had yet to contact the family. A spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, said he was not aware of the incident, promising to get across to the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area for clarification.
