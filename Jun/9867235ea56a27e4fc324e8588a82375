Former Chelsea star, Didier Drogba, has been awarded an honorary degree for his work of charity in Ivory Coast.
The Network of Universities of Science and Technology of the Countries of Africa south of the Sahara (RUSTA) presented the honorary degree to the football star. An honorary degree is an academic degree for which a university (or other degree-awarding institution) waives the usual requirements, such as matriculation, attendance, course credits, a dissertation, and the passing of comprehensive examinations. The degree is usually typically a doctorate or, less commonly, a master’s degree,
RUSTA said Drogba was deserving of the award in recognition of his contributions to nation-building and restoration of peace in his country. Drogba’s peace-keeping contribution to Ivory Coast can be dated back to 2005 when he helped to enact a ceasefire after qualifying for the world cup, DailyMail reported. During the civil war in Ivory Coast, the former Chelsea star had interceded by making a plea to the combatants, which led to a ceasefire after five years of war. As a footballer, Drogba was highly involved in charity work and had once donated his £3m fees from an endorsement deal with Pepsi to build a hospital in the Ivory Coast. Though Drogba made a failed bid for the presidency role in the Ivory Coast’s football association, he still carried out his humanitarian deeds through the platform of the Didier Drogba Foundation. The honorary degree was welcomed with joy by Drogba’s family members.
