The Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, on Wednesday declined comments when invited by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to speak on the achievements of the 9th Senate in the last two years. The Senate set aside the Wednesday plenary to celebrate the achievements of the Lawan-led Senate since it was inaugurated on June 11, 2019. There was, however, a mild drama after the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, had delivered his speech and Lawan invited Abaribe to give his own speech. The Minority Leader merely stood up and said, â€œThank you Mr. President but the Minority Leader will like to decline to make comments. The Senate President thanked Abaribe for his comments and called others senators to make their comments. Abaribe then walked out of the chamber.
