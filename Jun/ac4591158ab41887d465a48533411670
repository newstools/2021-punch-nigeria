Nollywood actress, Jaiye Kuti, has claimed that the spirit of late Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua — the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations — visited her after his death, even though she never met the cleric in person when he was alive. The clergyman died on June 5, 2021 — a week before his 58th birthday. In a post on her Instagram account, the thespian explained how she felt when the cleric’s spirit visited her saying, “my head was swollen and I saw a gentle pass of him”. Kuti wrote, “I have never met you one-on-one, but your spirit visited me when you died. I was in Offa alone in my room. My head was swollen and I saw a gentle pass of Him. There was something good about that soul. “Christ was poor but feeding the people and taking care of everyone. You did the same to many. I know two people who truly gave their lives to Christ through Him. May the Good Lord rest your soul in peace. Pastor T.B. Joshua.” With the actress’ revelation, some of her fans and followers flooded her comment section to eulogise the man of God. An Instagram user, @marydanpome, wrote, “My daddy, I missed you. My prayers every day is that I live a life of righteousness so I can see you in heaven one day.” Another user of the platform, markozadhe, queried the actress, saying “His dead spirit visited you literally? Or figuratively?”
