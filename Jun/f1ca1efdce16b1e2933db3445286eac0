The National Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Ismaeel Ahmed, on Wednesday, said the Federal Government didn’t ban the use of Twitter, it only suspended its operations. He said this at a press conference heralding the rescheduled Progressive Youths Conference now to hold next week. Ahmed said, “The government didn’t ban social media as a lot of people will insinuate. It is very important that we know that because Facebook is still in operation, Instagram is still in operation, WhatsApp is still in operation, and a lot of other social media platforms are still in operation. “In fact, some people will tell you Twitter is for the elite young people and not necessarily for the general public. “I think there are far more subscribers on Facebook in Nigeria than there are on Twitter. But haven said that, it is still a very important medium for people. “So, whatever it is that the government felt to suspend Twitter, not even ban, there was a suspension and of course, there is a conversation going on between the government and the representatives of Twitter and I’m sure it will be resolved.” Ismaeel who is also a member of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee, also said while he was personally not happy about the suspension of the operations of the microblogging site, he had no trouble identifying with the federal government for taking the decision because the site crossed the line by deleting a tweet by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Speaking about the proposed conference, Ismaeel said President Buhari has agreed to declare open the event which will be held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, on Monday, June 21, 2021.
