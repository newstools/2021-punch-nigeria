El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, has said he plans to submit a bill this week that seeks to make bitcoin a legal tender in the country. He said this during a presentation at the Bitcoin 2021 conference that held in Miami last week. Bukele said, “Next week, I will send to congress a bill that will make bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador. In the short term this will generate jobs and help provide financial inclusion.” To make this a reality, the country is partnering with Strike, a bitcoin payments firm launched by its Chief Executive Officer, Jack Mallers. El Salvador is looking to become the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Speaking on the partnership, Mallers said, “What’s transformative here is that bitcoin is both the greatest reserve asset ever created and a superior monetary network. Holding bitcoin provides a way to protect developing economies from potential shocks of fiat currency inflation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
