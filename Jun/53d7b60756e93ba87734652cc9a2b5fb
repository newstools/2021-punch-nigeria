THE Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, and other top officers of the Nigeria Police Force, on Wednesday met with the House of Representatives’ Committee on Police Affairs behind closed doors. The IG, who spoke to journalists before the meeting started, said the interaction would allow both sides to come up with modalities for effective policing of the country as the nation continued to experience security crisis. Baba said, “We are here to interact with the chairman and members of the House Committee on Police Affairs. We want to use this interaction to ensure effective policing and better security and movement of all Nigerians. We want to see that Nigerians can close their eyes and sleep. I want to assure the House of a better security management.” The IG also noted that with the various strategies being put in place by the new police leadership under his watch, the cases of insecurity ravaging the country would soon be history. The police boss also explained that all the six-geopolitical zones of the country were represented in the current Police Management Team. He said, “There is a senior officer of the Force on the rank of Deputy Inspector-General of Police in all the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria representing the region in the highest decision-making of the police hierarchy.” Chairman of the committee, Bello Kumo, said the meeting became necessary for familiarisation between the lawmakers and the new police leadership, and to see how the two sides could collaborate on how to find a common solution to the security challenges in the country.
