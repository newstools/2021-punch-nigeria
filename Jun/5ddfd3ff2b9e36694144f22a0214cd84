The National Youth Service Corps on Wednesday advised its drivers to always abide by safe driving protocols while on the highways. The organisation also urged them to pay due attention to the condition of the official vehicles in their possessions, their personal safety, that of other officers and road users, as well as the public property being conveyed. A statement on Wednesday by the NYSC Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Emeka Mgbemena, said the NYSC Director-General, Brigadier General Shuaibu, spoke while declaring open NYSC Drivers’ Workshop in Abuja. According to him, the management would continue to train the drivers to tackle the present-day challenges of safe driving. He said, “As a matter of policy, the management will continue to reward honest and hardworking members of staff, while erring ones will be sanctioned in line with extant rules and regulations.” Copyright PUNCH.
