The Synagogue Church of All Nations has said the death of its General Overseer, Prophet Temitope Joshua, aka TB Joshua, increased the church’s followers on social media by over 600,000. The church said it had also received tributes from 195 countries since the announcement of his demise. The ministry stated this on Tuesday during a press briefing in Lagos to officially announce programmes for his burial. The briefing was led by a Briton, Dr Gary Tonge, who claimed to be a friend of the ministry. The cleric died on Saturday, June 5, 2021, just seven days to his 58th birthday. Tonge, who read the address, said TB Joshua’s death was by divine will. He said, “His supernatural call home was met with an outpouring of millions of testimonies and tributes from 195 countries – representing every tribe, every tongue and every nation on the face of the earth. “The news of his departure also led to an increase of 600,000 followers on the TB Joshua Ministries Facebook Page, reaching a total of 6,200,000 — the largest of any religious figure in Africa. “In Prophet TB Joshua’s own words, ‘The beauty of our achievement is when we no longer live and our achievement is still there, continuing to linger on in the eyes and ears of children yet unborn’.” He stated that there would be a candle light procession in honour of the cleric on July 5, while the lying-in-state would be on July 8, from 11am to 5pm. Tonge said TB Joshua would be buried in Lagos on July 9.
