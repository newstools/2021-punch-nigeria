Ekiti State House of Assembly is set to pass a bill to check alleged extortionist activities of traders and supplier of goods in the state. The Speaker, Funminiyi Afuye, said that the bill, “Ekiti State Consumer Protection Bill, “is to help in checkmating the activities of extortionists and shylocks in the system.” The Assembly on Wednesday committed the bill to the House Committee on Investment, Trade and Industry.
