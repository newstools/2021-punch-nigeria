Cristiano Ronaldo remains favourite to win the Euro 2020 Golden Boot despite Portugal’s exit, while his biggest rivals are Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku and Czech Republic’s Patrik Schick. The Portugal captain became the leading scorer in European Championship history when a brace in their opening game against Hungary moved him two clear of Michel Platini on 11, and he bagged another goal in a 4-2 defeat to Germany. Ronaldo then scored two penalties in a 2-2 draw with France to move alongside record-holder Ali Daei on 109 international goals and that tally now includes a combined 21 at European Championship (14) and World Cup (7) level – more than any other European player in history. The 36-year-old has incredibly scored in five successive European Championships since his debut in 2004 and nine consecutive major tournaments having struck in each of his four World Cups, including four in 2018, but has yet to add an international Golden Boot to his astonishing CV. However, having fired blanks in their 1-0 defeat to Belgium in the last 16, Ronaldo is now left stranded on five goals and must hope his fellow contenders still left in the competition – including Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku (2 goals) – fail to catch him up.
