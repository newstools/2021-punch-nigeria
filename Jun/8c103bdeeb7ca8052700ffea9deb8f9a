The Chairman of the event’s Main Organising Committee, Godwin Enakhena, in a letter of invitation to the teams, said the competition was put together to keep the teams busy, having tasted action last in 2019 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Enakhena said, “The last time our girls played active basketball was in 2019. This is a sport that is like life to them and the reason they are practicing daily. We have given them reason to be happy by putting this tournament together.” According to Enakhena, the MFM Sports Department has collaborated with the Lagos State Sports Commission and the Lagos State Basketball Association to ensure a hitch-free competition.
