Afrobeat singer, Akanbi Sodiq, aka Oluwastock, has said that his priority is to make fans happy by constantly giving them good songs.

The industry is fast growing and there is a constant demand for good songs. I can assure my fans that there would be no bad songs from me.” The singer, who is signed to Billyque Entertainment, also noted that he had a new song in the works, which would be released soon. He said, “I formally got into the industry in 2017 and I have taken time to master the game. Now, I am ready to give fans several pieces of myself through relatable songs. As a matter of fact, one of my songs would be released soon and I am sure my fans would love it.” Oluwastock also stated that he was excited about the growth of his career over the years. He added, “My previous songs and collaborations, including ‘Olaide’, ‘Time’, ‘Doaa’ and ‘Pull-Up’ have helped to carve an identity for me and I am ready to raise the bar. The wonderful reception I have enjoyed from fans have convinced me that music is my calling. “I am excited about my career and how smooth things are going for me and my team. I have come a long way and I am hoping that my fans would continue to support my brand.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
