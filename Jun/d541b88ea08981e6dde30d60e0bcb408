Twenty stocks recorded price appreciation at the end of trading on Tuesday, with 12.40% FGN MAR 2036, CWG Plc, Berger Paints Nigeria Plc, Red Star Express Plc and NEM Insurance Company Plc leading the park. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said trading at the domestic equities market opened the week on a sour note, as late sell-offs on Airtel Africa underpinned a 1.7 per cent decline in the ASI to 38,507.33 points. They noted that the month-to-date gain declined to 0.2 per cent while year-to-date loss increased to 4.4 per cent. “Analysing by sectors, the insurance (+0.4 per cent), banking (+0.2 per cent) and oil and gas (+0.1 per cent) indices closed higher while the consumer goods (-0.2 per cent) index declined. The industrial goods index closed flat,” they said. The analysts had said on Friday that they expected investors to continue cherry-picking stocks ahead of the half-year 2021 dividend declarations. They said, “With the recent development in the fixed income market, we are approaching an inflexion point; we, therefore, see scope for increased buying interest from risk-averse investors. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Copyright PUNCH.
