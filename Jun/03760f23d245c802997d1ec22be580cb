Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, has said that building sustainable food systems is one of the key strategies that the Federal Government is exploring to eliminate poverty across Nigeria. He said this in a Dialogue for the United Nations Food Systems Summit held in Abuja on Tuesday. In a statement signed by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo said, “For the government of Nigeria, our commitment to sustainable food systems is one of the key strategies for eliminating poverty across Nigeria. “We know that our target of lifting a hundred million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade is only achievable if we focus on substantially improving agriculture and food systems which assure us of not just good food, but also jobs. “This perspective on addressing hunger, malnutrition and poverty runs through our policy frameworks, including our recently launched National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, and our nutrition policy that addresses the issues of a sustainable and nutrition sensitive food system.” According to Osinbajo, 39 dialogues have been held nationally and sub-nationally and are accessible to stakeholders in a bid to identify challenges that clog the wheel of progress in the relevant sectors.
