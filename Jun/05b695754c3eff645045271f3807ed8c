Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has urged the African Commission on Human and Peoplesâ€™ Rights in Banjul, Gambia, to stop the Federal Government and the National Assembly from supporting and pushing through bills to gag the media. SERAP said the need by the commission to push for the withdrawal of the bill became necessary in order to stop the imposition of arbitrary and harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and practitioners in Nigeria. In a complaint addressed to the Chairperson of the Commission, Solomon Dersso, and the Commissioner and Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, Ms Jamesina King, SERAP said the push by the Federal Government and the National Assembly to support and pass the two anti-media bills was unlawful. The group, in the complaint dated June 26, 2021, and signed by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, noted that the anti-media bills were the latest threats to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country.
