The Ogun State Police Command said it had invited the parents of the students who allegedly unleashed mayhem in some parts of Abeokuta, the state capital. The students were alleged to have caused violence after a gambling competition went awry between two public schools in Abeokuta. The PUNCH gathered that the students attacked one another with different weapons. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the command could not arrest the students because they were underage. He, however, said the command had invited their parents. Oyeyemi said, “They are underage. There is no way we can arrest and detain them. But we are making efforts to make sure that we checkmate their activities. They are not more than 14 to 15 years old. Their parents have been invited and the state government is on top of it. We are making efforts jointly with the school authorities and the parents to make sure that such an ugly incident does not recur.” Meanwhile, the state House of Assembly has expressed concern over the spate of violent clashes involving secondary school students in the state. The House at plenary called on the state Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology to, as a matter of urgency, interface with other stakeholders, including security agencies and the Parent-Teacher Association towards curbing the menace. The Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, made the call while responding to the submission of a member representing Abeokuta North State Constituency, Modupe Mujota, and her Odeda counterpart, Oludaisi Elemide.
