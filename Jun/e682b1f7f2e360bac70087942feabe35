FOURTEEN bandits were in the early hours of Sunday reportedly gunned down during a gun duel with the police in the Katsina-Ala town, Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. The bandits were said to have met their waterloo when they stormed a police station in the town where some of the bandits were being detained. A source, who simply identified himself as Kajo, said the bandits numbering about 50 had driven in Toyota Corolla vehicles to the police station. It was reliably gathered that the police engaged the bandits in a gun duel, leading to the death of 14 of the attackers. “We started hearing gunshots around 1:30 am today (Sunday) around the police station in Katsina Ala town, everybody in the neighborhood were woken up with the sporadic gunshots and praying to God. “It was around 5:00 am that some leaders in the area visited the station after they had contacted the Divisional Police Officer. “Surprisingly, the police gunned down over 10 of these bandits while many of them escaped with gunshot wounds. We also heard that two of them were captured alive.” When contacted, the Benue State Police Command spokesperson, Catherine Anene, confirmed the report and said that 14 of the bandits were brought down by the police during the attack.
