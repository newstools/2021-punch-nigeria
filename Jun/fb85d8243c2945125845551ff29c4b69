Super Eagles star Moses Simon donated N200,000 to two Lagos-based teams Little Wonders Football Academy and 36 Lions, after they impressed the Nantes star during a test game in Lagos on Monday, The PUNCH. The Nigeria international featured for Little Wonders as they edged 36 Lions 3-2 in a friendly game organised by Brigadier-General Mayirenso Saraso. “I felt honoured when he (Saraso) asked me to come over and help out in this noble cause,” the 24-year-old said after the game. “His desire to use sports, particularly football, to reposition the youths under his area is commendable. “The idea will no doubt play a role in boosting the relationship between the individuals. That trust will go a long way because it’s a noble idea.” Last year, Simon drilled boreholes for the people of Obagaji Agatu community in Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State, where his father hails from. He has also reached out to Internally Displaced Persons IN Southern Kaduna, donating clothes, food and drugs, paying for their medical bills and a donation of N500,000. Simon is expected to depart for France in the coming days for Nantes pre-season training. They will face Watford on July 31 in their first pre-season friendly at Vicarage Road. Nantes avoided the drop last season after they defeated Toulouse 3-1 in the relegation playoffs in May. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
