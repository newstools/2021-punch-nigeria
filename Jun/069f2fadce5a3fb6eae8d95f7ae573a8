The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has said the tepid economic recovery and slow vaccine rollout programme in Africa was threatening the scale of investment recovery. According to its World Investment Report 2021 released on Monday, UNCTAD said the Foreign Direct Investment flows to Africa declined by 16 per cent in 2020 to $40bn from $47bn in 2019 as the pandemic continued to have a persistent and multifaceted negative impact on cross-border investments globally and regionally. The report said despite a slight increase in inflows to Nigeria from $2.3bn in 2019 to $2.4bn, FDI to West Africa decreased by 18 per cent to $9.8bn in 2020. In his remarks, the UNCTAD’s director, Investment and Enterprise, James Zhan, said, “The challenging environment affected all aspects of foreign investment. “Despite projections for only a weak investment recovery in 2021, there are some mitigating factors that signal FDI picking up momentum by 2022 and returning to pre-pandemic levels.” The factors according to the report include an expected rise in demand for commodities, especially in the energy sector as the global economy picks up steam in the second half of 2021, which will result in a higher resource-seeking investment. Also, the reconfiguration of global value chains and the increasing importance of regional value chains will open new opportunities for African countries and the impending visualisation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement’s Sustainable Investment Protocol.
