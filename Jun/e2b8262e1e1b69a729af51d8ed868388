The founder of Iyaniwura Children Care Foundation, Mrs Jumoke Otitoloju, has urged the federal and state governments to ameliorate the challenges being faced by physically challenged children to access health care. Otitoloju, at an event, tagged, ‘Festival of special children,’ lamented the plight of children living with disabilities in accessing health care. She said, “Accessing health care services is hard and costly for people living with disabilities. Primary Health Centre is supposed to be free; medication for illness is not free and medicine is not available sometimes. There are also serious challenges with mobility and accessibility in and out of most PHCs. “The daily reality for most children with disability is that they are often condemned to a poor start in life and deprived of opportunities to develop to their full potential and participate in societal activities.” The General Manager of the Lagos State Office for Disabilities Affairs, Mr Oluwadamire, Ogundairo, said the state government was interested in providing adequate health care to children living with disabilities. “The state government through LASODA is looking at means to make life more meaningful to these people and also create more values in them. That is why it is important for the government to partner non-governmental organisations to ensure the children living with disabilities are well nurtured,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
