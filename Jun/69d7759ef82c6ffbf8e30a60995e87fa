Gunmen suspected to be robbers have shot dead Mrs Olayemi Odetomi, wife of a former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in Oyo State, Peter Oderomi. Our correspondent gathered that the 66-year-old woman was killed at her home around Bodija-Ashi area of Ibadan on Friday. The deceased’s husband, who was a former chairman of Ogbomoso South Local Government Area of Oyo State served as a commissioner during the administration of the late governor Abiola Ajimobi. Although some people claimed that the killing was perpetrated by robbers, others said the woman was assassinated. However, this claim couldn’t be established at the time of filing this story. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Adewale Osifeso, said police had begun investigation into the killing. He said in a statement, “The deceased, Olayemi Odetomi, aged 66, died on the spot after being shot during a robbery incident which occurred during the early hours of Friday, June 25, 2021 in her home. Updates on investigations would be provided in due course.” A popular radio presenter in Ibadan, who was also an indigene of Ogbomoso, Titus Badejo, was on Saturday shot dead while leaving a club at the Oluyole area of Ibadan.
