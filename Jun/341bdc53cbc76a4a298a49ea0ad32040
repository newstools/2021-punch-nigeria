The Rotary Club of Maryland, Ikeja, District 9110, Lagos, has donated two fully equipped medical cabins to Ososa and Obasa communities in Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. The club said the donation of the two portacabins with drugs was part of its efforts at improving maternal and child health services and also promoting disease prevention and treatment in these communities. The president of the club, Mr. Obafemi Obadina, at a briefing said over 8,500 residents would benefit from the N12.9m worth of medical facilities. He said the gesture was part of activities marking the club’s 19th anniversary. Obadina said, “The club carried out a need assessment in the two communities and found out that the residents lacked access to basic health care facilities. This prompted the club to erect the cabins. “We saw that there was a dire need for medical facilities in these communities.  The pregnant women there don’t have access to basic health care. There is a lack of maternal health services in these communities.  These medical facilities that we have donated to them will improve access to maternal health services and promote child survival.” Also, the past president of the club, Mr. Tunde Olaniran, said neighbouring communities would also benefit from the project. He said the club had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ogun State Government to provide medical professionals as well as ensure the facilities are appropriately maintained. Olaniran noted that the head and residents of the respective communities had been engaged to ensure the medical facilities were well utilised and protected. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
