THE Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, has denied any disagreement with the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr Godswill Akpabio, over the reconstitution of a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission. There were media reports that the two ministers were locked in a supremacy battle over the membership of the NDDC board. It was also reported that Sylva, who hails from Bayelsa, was bent on preventing some persons from the state from being appointed Managing Director of the commission, whom Akpabio from Akwa Ibom had sympathy for. Sylva in a statement titled, “No rift between Sylva and Akpabio,” signed by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Affairs, Mr Julius Bokoru, dismissed the reports as false and the handiwork of mischief makers. The statement read in part, “The story is false and nothing more than a string of poorly thought-out and poorly crafted lies that should be totally disregarded and discarded. “Sylva has maintained excellent relations with Senator Akpabio through the years. The duo consider themselves brothers and comrades in the quest of building a more prosperous Niger Delta and a stronger Nigeria. “Sylva is currently hosting the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit and while he has the development of the Niger Delta at heart, he is not fixated on who becomes who, in the formation of the NDDC board. He rather hopes and prays that for the sake of the development of the region, competent, committed, compassionate and patriotic people get appointed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
