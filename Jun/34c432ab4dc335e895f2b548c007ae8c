The Northern Governors Forum has described the assassination of a former Special Adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan on Political Matters, Ahmed Gulak, as most unfortunate and totally condemnable. In a statement on Monday, the Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, said the killing was a criminal act that must be condemned in totality. Lalong said, “The killing of Gulak must be seen as a criminal act and treated as such. We must guide against  insinuations and politicisation that could lead to further violence.” He said the report by the police that it had identified and engaged the suspected killers of the late politician should further be consolidated upon to enable security agencies forestall future occurrence. The Forum has also expressed disgust over another abduction of innocent citizens across three local Government areas of Niger State, including students and teachers of an Islamiya school. Lalong said the “horrible situation needs to be brought to an end in order to give respite for the people to engage in their legitimate activities without molestation.” He reiterated the commitment of the Forum in working with the security agencies and the Federal Government in tacking the ugly level of insecurity in the region and the nation at large.
