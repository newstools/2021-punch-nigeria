Ebenezer Bajela Former FC Zürich goalkeeper, Ike Shorunmu, has tipped Switzerland to beat Wales in their opening Euro 2020 Group A tie at the Baku Olimpiya Stadionu, Azerbaijan. Shorunmu, who spent three years in Switzerland during his professional career, said he was confident that the Swiss had what it took to stop the threat from the Welsh stars. He said, “I am sure that Switzerland have a perfect game plan to stop Wales star players like Harry Wilson, Aaron Ramsey, Daniel James and Joe Allen. “I am sure that coach Vladimir Petkovic must have worked on it since the draw was made. It is going to be an interesting match but I think Switzerland will have the upper hand because they have Xherdan Shaqiri, who plays for Liverpool and some other top players like Granit Xhaka and Manuel Akanji. “Shaqiri is a man who can do damage to any team and he is a player that Wales must really look out for. “Wales star man Gareth Bale didn’t have a great season at Tottenham and I think that will in a way affect the Welsh team because he is their key man. He is not going to be much of a threat as I am sure that the Swiss will cage him. “I don’t want to make any prediction as regards the scoreline but I am confident that the Swiss will win.
