Youths in the Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State have threatened to shut down facilities of the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company in the area, alleging that the activities of the firm had thrown them into darkness for about a week. The youths said PHED came to Anyama and Ndoki communities in the company of security operatives to cut down about 12 electricity poles without explaining to the residents the reason for the action. A youth leader in the community, Ejike Dike, said several communities in the council had been plunged into total darkness as a result of PHED’s action. “PHED came to Ayama and Obunku with a joint task force, breaking poles. Up to 12 or 13 poles were broken and they are trying to create problems where there is none in Oyigbo. “What PHED is trying to do is to create a problem between Oyigbo people and security operatives. We are saying to PHED that we don’t want to see them again in Ndoki land. They don’t even have any business with us. “From Ayama to the last community, Obete, there is darkness. We are giving them till Monday to restore power. If they fail to do so, the supply they are getting to be feeding other people and collecting money for, we will stop it,” he stated. Efforts to reach PHED Acting Manager, Corporate Communications, Chioma Aninwe, were unsuccessful, as she neither answered several calls put across to her nor replied to a text message sent to her mobile phone as of the time of filing this report.
