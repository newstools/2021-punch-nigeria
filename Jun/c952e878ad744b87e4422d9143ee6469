The Senate has urged the Federal Capital Development Authority to take action on the renovation of the National Assembly complex to stop the leaking of the roof during rainy season. Chairman of the Senate Committee on Services, Sani Musa said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the complex was flooded on Tuesday due to leakages from the roof after downpour. In response, Musa urged the FCDA to commence renovation of the complex within the shortest possible time. “The building needs to be worked on and if you recall, we proposed the renovation of the complex which the President graciously approved. It is in the budget. “And we have done the needful. Instead of the National Assembly management to handle this project, this project was domiciled in the FCDA because they are the owners of most of the public buildings in Abuja. “We know that the complex was handed over to the National Assembly management but yet we requested that the renovation should be undertaken by FCDA. “Surprisingly however, when it got to the Federal Executive Council, one of the ministers made a remark which made the president ask for the review of the whole process and today, you can see what is happening with the complex. “It was flooded, everywhere is leaking. I will call on the FCDA and FEC to take a look at our submissions and do the needful.” (NAN)
