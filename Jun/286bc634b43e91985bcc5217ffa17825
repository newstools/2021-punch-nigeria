The weather has been among the talking points ahead of Tuesday’s Euro 2020 clash between age-old enemies England and Germany. German newspaper Bild has vilified UEFA as Joachim Low’s men have not been able to train at Wembley Stadium the night before the round-of-16 match because of the heavy rain in London which damaged the stadium’s hallowed turf. UEFA has taken the decision to protect the pitch ahead of the game, denying Germany the time-honoured tradition of preparing at the host stadium the night before a game. According to Bild, Low is furious about the decision, which means his side will have one more training session in Herzogenaurauch in Germany on Monday before flying to London for the match. The German media outlet even went as far as to describe the situation as a ‘distortion of competition’ that favours England, who have so far played all three of their Euro 2020 group games at Wembley. Players from both teams must experience ‘the aura of the stadium, the smell of the (changing rooms) and the feeling of the turf’ before the match in order to be on a level playing field before they walk out onto the pitch, Bild expressed. England will be hoping to turn any potential factor to their advantage, hoping to avenge their poor record against Germany in major tournaments. Given the lukewarm form of Gareth Southgate’s men at Euro 2020 to date, whatever the outcome or the state of the rain-ravaged pitch, fans will be desperate that the game isn’t a wash-out.
