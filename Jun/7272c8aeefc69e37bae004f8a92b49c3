Embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, on Wednesday, has appeared at the Yaba Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos State where the hearing of the sexual assault case against the actor is set to commence. Baba Ijesha has been under fire since April 22, 2021, when the Lagos State Police Command announced his arrest for allegedly sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the care of popular comedienne, Adekola Adekanya, otherwise called Princess. The case has been stalled due to the industrial action by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria. As the judicial workers called off their strike last week, Baba Ijesha has appeared in court for the hearing of the case. See photos below:
