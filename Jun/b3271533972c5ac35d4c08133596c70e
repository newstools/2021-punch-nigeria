KADUNA State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, has disclosed that he has provided a comprehensive briefing to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on the rightsizing policy of his administration and the steps taken to implement it. The governor said the state would seek accountability for the Nigerian Labour Congress’s actions in the state by setting up “a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the events of May 2021.” He explained that it was hiring over 10,000 staff because rightsizing obliged the government to continuously recruit teachers, doctors, nurses and other qualified staff to provide vital service. A statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr Muyiwa Adekeye, on Monday quoted the governor to have assured the President that “KDSG is determined not to allow a repeat of the pains, economic losses and the restraints of freedom that the NLC inflicted on the people of Kaduna State.” Alluding to the NLC’s renewed threat of strike action, the statement noted the NLC had demonstrated that it did not even believe in equality among its own members by describing the transfer of one KDSG employee to a place where other civil servants were serving as victimisation. “KDSG employees are serving with dedication in Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area amidst all the challenges. Yet, the NLC describes the transfer of one KDSG employee to Birnin-Gwari LGA as victimisation, as if other staff members who have been loyally serving in the same area are lesser humans or permanent victims.” Copyright PUNCH.
