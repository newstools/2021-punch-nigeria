Ultimate Fighting Championship President, Dana White, says it will be impossible for middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya, to get his wish of fighting archrival, Robert Whittaker, on home soil in Auckland in October. The 31-year-old had called out Whittaker, who he defeated for the middleweight strap in 2019, for a rematch, hoping it would be staged in Auckland. “Adesanya, before this fight happened, maybe two or three days ago, we got the word that he wants to fight again in October. It’s like, he hasn’t even fought yet and this kid is already talking about his next fight. I love that Adesanya has become a very badass champion for us. So, we’ll figure out him and Whittaker ASAP. “You’re talking about New Zealand or Australia? I would highly doubt it. That’s like asking if we can go to Canada in October, they’re pretty much in the same boat.” Adesanya on Sunday defeated Italy’s Marvin Vettori via a unanimous decision in a domineering bout to defend his title for the third consecutive time with the Nigerian calling out Whittaker after the fight. “You know (who I want to fight next) my nemesis, Bobby Whittaker, Bobby knuckles, I knocked him out twice before in one fight, I don’t know what is going to happen with all these COVID-19 sh*t,” Adesanya said after the fight. “We need to run that back in Auckland, we need to run that back in my territory this time, I’ll tell you when it is, you don’t have to decide, I’m the king.” Whittaker replied in a tweet, “Rest up, see you soon.” Copyright PUNCH.
