The Federal University of Technology, Owerri,  has instituted a N20m professorial chair as part of its measures to encourage scientific and technological research among academic staff of the institution. The out-going Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Francis Eze, said that as a university of technology with the responsibility of accelerating the pace of technological and human capital development, granting the same fund with other institutions would retrogressively impede the nation’s march to world technological advancement and innovation. Eze, a Professor of Physics and the 7th substantive VC of the institution, stated this on Monday, while briefing newsmen on his five year stewardship as the chief executive of the university. He said that his administration had introduced many new courses and secured their approvals. He said, “My administration has equally attracted a N6m African Centre of Excellence, in addition to another World Bank Assisted Centre of Excellence estimated at $11 million”. The VC furthermore, disclosed that the university under his leadership had produced policy documents to enhance administration especially for appraisal and promotion of staff, student’s regulation, sexual harassment and anti-plagiarism documents.
