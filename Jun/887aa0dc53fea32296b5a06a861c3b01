The Special Adviser, Lagos State Office of Civic Engagement, Aderemi Adebowale, has warned against open defecation, saying the menace may lead to disease outbreak. Adebowale stated this at an event on open defecation, organised by her office, in the Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area. She urged residents to shun open defecation as it might lead to diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea. “During the rainy season, which we are now, water supplies can become contaminated with such faecal matters, which consequently contaminate the sources of water people use for drinking and many other purposes. “Improved sanitation and hygiene practices are fundamental to child survival, socio-economic development and well-being of society. Eliminating open defecation has its benefits from the health, nutrition, learning, social and economic perspectives,” she said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
