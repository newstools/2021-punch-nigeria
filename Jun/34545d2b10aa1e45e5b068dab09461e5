About 50 houses were reportedly burnt, while a woman was feared killed in a land dispute involving Filiya and Shongom districts in the Shongom Local Government Area of Gombe State. The state governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, stated this on Monday during a briefing after a security council he presided. The governor, who was joined by the traditional ruler of the area, Mai Kaltungo, Saleh Mohammed; the Commissioner for Internal Security, Adamu Kupto; and the Commissioner for Information, Julius Ishaya, said the incident was as a result of land tussle. Mohammed said, “In the Shongom Local Government Area, we have six districts and the problem that occurred is in Filiya and Shongom districts. “It does not affect the whole of Shongom Local Government. Some houses were burnt and a woman who was sick and couldn’t get out of her residence that was set on fire.” Ishaya said the ban on militia and hunter groups would be reinforced, adding extent of damage was much. “We are talking about over 50 houses that were burnt, including food and other essential items of the people. Council condemns the carnage inflicted on the people of both Shongom and Pero. “The council has directed security agencies to bring perpetrators of this act to book. Council also reiterated that the ban on militia and hunters group stands,” Ishaya said. The traditional ruler said the community was working to ensure that there would not be a repeat of such.
