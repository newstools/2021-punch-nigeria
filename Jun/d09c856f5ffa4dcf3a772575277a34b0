The Federal Government has warned Nigerians, especially nursing mothers and pregnant women, against patronising quack nurses and embrace Primary Health Centres built in their domains to avert needless death. A statement on Tuesday said the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals, Joke Orelope-Adefulire , said this in Lagos State at the inauguration of the Iru Estate Primary Health Centre, adding that  Nigerians should be wary of the kind of people they consult for medical attention. The centre was built by the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals. She said, “This health facility was constructed in commemoration of the first year in office of the monarch of Iru kingdom, Oba Wasiu Gbolahan Lawal. “We need you to utilise this place effectively. Please don’t patronise local nurses and uncertified health workers, patronise only the professionals. Series of health challenges like kidney failure, heart failure are caused by the people who sell expired drugs.” Wife of the former Senate President and Governor of Kwara State, Mrs Oluwatoyin Saraki, said there was need for everyone to prioritise the primary health care services to guarantee safety of lives of the people of the grass roots.
