A former Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa, has urged eminent Nigerians to come together to brainstorm on finding solutions to the security problems facing the country. This call came barely twenty-four hours after his successor, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, in a press statement urged southern leaders to speak up against attacks on northern traders by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra. Bafarawa in his press statement said, “We should do everything possible at our disposal to contribute our quota towards peace and security of the country. “The challenges of Boko Haram, banditry, kidnapping, threat for secession, slow economic growth resulting from increased level of poverty, clamouring for structuring or restructuring, call for one division or another are important issues which call for considerable degree of attention not only by the government but also by our political and traditional classes so that at least the country would make a headway towards unity, peace, cohesion, growth and development.” Copyright PUNCH.
