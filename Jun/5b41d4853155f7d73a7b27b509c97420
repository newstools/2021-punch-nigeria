PResidents of Orile-Oko in the Remo North Local Government Area of Ogun State have appealed to Governor Dapo Abiodun to come to their aid by putting an end to the 16-year blackout in the community. The residents lamented that their community last enjoyed electricity supply over 16 years ago during the tenure of a former governor of the state, Chief Olusegun Osoba. Osoba governed the state between 1999 and 2003. Speaking on behalf of the community, the Lisa of Orile-Oko, High Chief Olakunle Olalekan, said life had become unbearable for the residents as a result of the blackout. Olalekan said the community had been in darkness since 2003. He said, “We are calling on the governor of Ogun State to come to our aid. Osoba did well in Orile-Oko by giving us six transformers, but since the transformers got spoilt 16 years ago, Orile-Oko has been in darkness and there is no one to assist us. “During the administration of Ibikunle Amosun, we wrote a letter to him to assist us and we heard that he gave some people money to fix them, but everything went wrong. “All the indigenes of Orile-Oko at home and abroad are very happy with our governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, for tarring the Eyinokan/Orile-Oko Road and we are expecting the same to be done to the Orile-Oko/Ishon Road.”    ,, Copyright PUNCH.
