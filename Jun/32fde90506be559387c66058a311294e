Tecno has been ranked as one of the top six brands on the continent on Brand Africa 100. This marked the company’s fifth consecutive year in the top six, a statement said on Wednesday. Speaking at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Public Communications Manager, Tecno, Vincent Uzoegbu said, “From the first day of our business, Tecno made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. “The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.” The Brand Africa 100 was established in 2011. The statement described it as the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying business in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. For 2021, over 80,000 brands were analysed. Marketing Manager, Tecno Nigeria, Attai Oguche said, “We’re very honoured to be listed again among Africa’s best brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business.
