The Osun State Police Command on Sunday said its detectives were closing in on suspected cultists who killed a rival cult member and robbed a Point-of-Sale terminal operator around the Oja Oba area of Osogbo. The deceased, it was learnt, was attacked by six men, who smashed his head with a big stone. Some residents that witnessed the killing also said the assailants had arrived in the area on two motorcycles and went for their target. A spokesperson for the Osun State Police Command, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the incident, adding that police operatives had since launched a manhunt for the perpetrators. She said, “When the distress call was received, a patrol team moved in and found the corpse of a young man suspected to be a cult member with an inscription, ‘777’ and other signs, on his chest. “We don’t have details of his identity, but sources revealed that the deceased was attacked by some suspected cultists numbering about six, who got to the scene on two motorcycles and started chasing the man. It was learnt that he was eventually caught and his head was smashed with a stone. “The same set of suspects also attacked and robbed one Mr Oyedeji, a PoS operator of a sum of N120,000 and one Abdulafeez of a sum of N200,000. Manhunt for the perpetrators is on, and detectives are closing in on the suspects.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
