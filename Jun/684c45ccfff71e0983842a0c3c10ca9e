There was jubilation in the Amukpe area of the Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State  on Saturday after policemen gunned down a notorious robber, identified simply as Diamond, aka Fowl Boy, who was said to have been terrorising residents of Sapele. The spokesman for the state police command, DSP Bright Edafe, stated this in a statement issued on Sunday. Edafe said, “A heavy gun duel ensued between the police and a notorious armed robbery syndicate; these armed robbers have been terrorising residents of Sapele for some time now and the police had been on their trail. “The deadly armed robber, Diamond, met his waterloo on Saturday, June 26, 2021, after a distress call was received by the Divisional Police Officer, Sapele Division, from the tropical area of Amukpe that a three-man gang of armed robbers was in the house of one man in Amukpe, Sapele.” In another development, a 33-year-old suspected car thief has been apprehended for attempting to steal a Toyota Camry car in Asaba. Edafe said a young lady went to pick her children from school on Friday, parked her vehicle at Regina Mundi by the Ogbe-Ogonogo Market, Asaba, and the suspect opened the door and was trying to remove the steering lock when the lady returned and raised the alarm.
