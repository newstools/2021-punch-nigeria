The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Osun State, on Tuesday, said it apprehended one Omolara Solanke for allegedly obtaining the sum of N2,680,000 from a political office seeker under false pretences. A spokesman for the NSCDC in the state, Daniel Adigun, in a statement, explained that the suspect promised to assist a politician, Razaq Salami, 48, who was contesting the post of councillor, to win the election. The money was to pay for the services of the 46-year-old suspect. Adigun stated that the suspect, working with five others, took the victim to a town in Ekiti State where the sum was obtained from him, after which they fled. “After several failed attempts to get in touch with the fraudsters, Rasaq lodged a complaint with the anti-fraud unit of the corps in Ekiti State, where investigation into the alleged crime  began. The anti-fraud unit of NSCDC, Osun command, was contacted to track the suspects. “In the process, Omolara Solanke was apprehended. The NSCDC boss in Osun State, Commandant, Emmanuel Ocheja, through the anti-fraud unit, handed over the suspect to the Ekiti command of the corps for further investigation and possible prosecution,” the statement added.
