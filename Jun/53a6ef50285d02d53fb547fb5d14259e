Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a property company, Family Homes Funds Limited, to provide 5,000 units of houses for teachers in the state. The event, which took place at the Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja, on Thursday, was witnessed by Senators from Kano, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, Barau Jibrin, and Kabiru Gaya, among others. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwa, in a statement said the signing of the MoU would help to actualise the dream of many teachers to own their own houses. He disclosed that the state government had already provided 220 hectares of land for the project, adding that all necessary documentation for the project had been signed and sealed. “Education is a major thrust in our administration. We must provide the entire needed infrastructure for our teachers. “We are enhancing the dignity of the teaching profession in our state. As we are having Government Reserved Areas, we are now going to have Teachers Reserved Areas,” Ganduje was quoted to have said in the statement. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
