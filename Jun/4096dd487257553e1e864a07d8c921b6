THE Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has said that the final report of a forensic audit of Niger Delta Development Commission will not be ready until end of July when it will be presented to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for implementation. Akpabio disclosed this on Tuesday evening in an interview with State House Correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, after meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari. The minister also disclosed that the name of nominees for the reconstitution of the NNDC board would be forwarded to the National Assembly soonest. “We have fast-tracked the process of constituting the board, but we insist that the most important thing is not just the development of the Niger Delta region but how to reposition NDDC to ensure optimal performance as against the practice in the past. “So, the forensic audit of NDDC is on course and it is progressing very well and I am happy with the progress made so far. “I am very certain that by the end of July which is just a month and a few weeks away, the final result will be given to the President for implementation. “In terms of the composition of the board of the NDDC, that of course, we have fast-tracked the process and the National Assembly will soon get the list. However, he said that this is not as crucial as the forensic audit whose presentation deadline had been slated for July. Akpabio expressed hope that the new board would implement the recommendations of the forensic audit to work and reposition the commission. He however regretted that in the past, the NDDC headquarters was disconnected from the national grid for about 15 years. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
