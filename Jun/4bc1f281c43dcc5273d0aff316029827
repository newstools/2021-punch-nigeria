Cititrust Holdings Plc says it has unveiled 29 graduate trainees of its newly established Cititrust Academy Graduate Management Programme. According to a statement on Wednesday, the Country Chief Executive, Mr Ikechukwu Peter, said at the graduation ceremony that the successful completion of the programme marked the beginning of the academy as a strong pillar of support to fresh graduates when starting a career path, to provide specialised knowledge, training, and development opportunities to advance into the corporate world. He admonished the graduands to embrace Cititrust’s corporate goal of building an amicable financial institution with its products and services enriching the customer experience. The Group Chief Executive, Mr Yemi Adefisan, while giving his welcome speech, informed the graduands that “they have become an alumnus of a great company, and should aspire to become leaders to dominate the entire Africa and the world at large in the provision of bespoke financial services. Nothing should be impossible.” He advised the graduands to imbibe team spirit which he said had become the hallmark and trait in Cititrust. The statement said he informed them that the company was built on the four core values of empathy, assurance, integrity, and nobility, and as such, operated an open-door policy to all its employees across West Africa and Europe, customers and other stakeholders.
