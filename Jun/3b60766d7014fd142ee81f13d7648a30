The United States Government says the suspension of Twitter by Nigeria is at variance with the 1999 Constitution which guarantees freedom of expression. The US said in a statement that the move undermines Nigeria’s ability to exercise this freedom and it sends a poor message to investors. The statement read, “Nigeria’s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The government’s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigeria’s ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses. “Banning social media and curbing every citizen’s ability to seek, receive and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation and accountability has never been greater. “The part to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts towards unity, peace and prosperity.” The Federal Government had on Friday suspended Twitter indefinitely after the social media platform deleted a tweet by the President which was considered offensive by many Nigerians. The Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, accused Twitter of promoting disunity and undermining the nation’s security.
The regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has come under fire from several rights groups including Amnesty International for several acts of human rights abuse.
