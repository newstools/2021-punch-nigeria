The Nigerian Petroleum Development Commission, a subsidiary of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, has approved a proposal to restore electricity supply to 70 communities in Edo State. The member representing Ovia Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Dennis Idahosa, who is behind the proposal, said the electrification project would bring comfort to over 100,000 families in his consistency. Idahosa, who stated this while giving his mid-term report to members of his constituency, also reiterated his promise to fulfil all his electioneering promises. He said, “During campaign, I went to Ogede and Oduna wards which consist of over 70 communities, I was shocked to discover that the communities have been in total darkness for five years. “The good news is that I have been able to get NPDC to commit to restoring electricity to the affected communities and the project has been re-awarded.” According to the lawmaker, some of the communities to benefit include Gelelege,  Igbine, Urokpokpo, Gelegele and Ukoro, among others.
