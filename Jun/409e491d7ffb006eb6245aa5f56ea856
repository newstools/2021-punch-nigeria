The National Union of Banks, Insurance and other Financial Institutions, on Saturday, urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to extend the two-week period given for senior bank officials to present their asset declaration forms. The National President of NUFIBIE, Anthony Abakpa, made the call in a telephone interview with Sunday PUNCH. Abakpa was reacting to media reports that the EFCC had asked all Managing Directors, Deputy Managing Directors and Executive Directors of banks to submit their asset declaration forms within two weeks or risk a 10-year jail term. The union president stated that the senior bank officials needed more time to respond appropriately and effectively. He said, “A two-week period is too short for all the senior banking officials to gather their acts together to respond appropriately. “If they want them to carry out the declarations effectively, they should extend the time because these officials will have to take some of the documents to court for signing and engage in other processes. “So, I think more time should be given to them, so that a proper job will be done, if they are not engaging in a witch-hunt.” He argued that the EFFC was duplicating efforts as all MDs, EDs, DMDs and general managers of banks had declared their assets through the commission as well as other regulatory bodies before assuming their current positions. “I think the EFCC is contradicting itself, because before you attain these top positions such as the MD, GM or DMD of a bank, specifically at the point of entry into any of these important roles, you have to declare your assets through the EFCC, NDIC and DSS. “So, all these people have previously declared their assets,” he added Copyright PUNCH.
