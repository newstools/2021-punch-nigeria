WIVE of state governors under the auspices of the Nigerian Governors’ Wives Forum on Monday expressed concerns over the worsening security situation across the country as well as the rate of poverty in Nigeria, among other social ills. They therefore expressed their readiness to work with their husbands, the governors, in their respective states to tackle the challenges headlong. The Chairperson of the forum, Bisi Fayemi, who is the wife of the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, disclosed these to reporters after a meeting they had at the Nigerian Governors’ Forum Secretariat in Abuja on Monday. “We are concerned about the security situation and the impact it has on women and children. We are also concerned about the job crisis in the country which is gradually consuming a whole lot of young people. “We are also concerned about the poverty that a lot of women face, especially in the rural communities,” she said, Mrs Fayemi said members of the forum were committed to supporting their respective state governments in making sure that they worked alongside their husbands to improve the quality of lives of citizens. “We, as wives, mothers and First Ladies, will do whatever we can in support of our husbands to ensure we bridge the gap and play whatever role we can mostly behind the scene to ensure that the quality of life of our people will be much better,” she added Copyright PUNCH.
