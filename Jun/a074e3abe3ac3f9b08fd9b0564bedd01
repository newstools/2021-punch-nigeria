Security agencies, comprising the military, police, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, and Vigilante Corps are to comb the forests to rescue the abducted Tegina Islamiyyah schoolchildren. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello revealed this when he visited the team to boost their morale in Kagara in the Rafi Local Government Area. Bello said was time for government to take a decisive action towards ending the bandits activities in the rural areas. “We have to try our possible best not to make them succeed in forcing us to change our normal lives. They started by displacing farmers from their farmlands, moved to burning farms, then moved to kidnappings and forcing us to close our schools. Now they have started attacking Islamic schools, only God knows what is next”, he said. The governor, who commended the security personnel for their efforts in fighting the bandits in the last few weeks, however, mourned the killing of 20 Vigilante Corps members by the bandits in Magama LGA. Earlier, the governor met with parents of the abducted schoolchildren at the palace of the Emir of kagara, Alhaji Ahmed Gunna, urging them to exercise patience as government was exploring all avenues to see to their safe rescue. The Emir of Kagara thanked the Governor for all the support, especially in the area of security to the emirate, and the support given to the family of the kidnapped schoolchildren. On his own part, the Headmaster of Salihu Tanko Islamiyyah School Tegina, Mallam Abubakar Alhassan said 15 of the teachers had escaped from the abductors in Zamfara State and were in military facility in Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State, where they would handed over to the Niger State Government soon.
