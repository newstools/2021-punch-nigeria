Grammy award-winning Nigerian singer, Ayo Balogun, also known as Wizkid, shocked his fans on Monday as he changed his Instagram name from Wizkid to Big Wiz. Without a formal announcement, the artiste has hinted on how he would rather be addressed by fans. Fans of the 30-year-old singer had in the past suggested that the singer remove the suffix ‘-kid’ from his name, based on his age and achievements in the Nigerian music industry over the past decade. However, his Twitter page, as of the time of this report, had still retained the name “Wizkid”, despite being active. Meanwhile, the singer is not the first Nigerian musician to change names, either formally or informally. For instance, Legendary singer, Tuface, changed his name to 2baba; iconic rap artiste, Sauce Kid, changed his name to Sinzu; and Kiss Daniel changed to Kizz Daniel. Wizkid started recording music at the age of 11. He signed his first major deal with Banky W and Captain Demuren’s Empire Mates Entertainment record label in 2009 and rose to prominence after his single ‘Holla at Your Boy’. Ever since the release of his debut album, Star Boy, which is also one of his pseudonyms, he has been soaring high. Recently, he snagged his first-ever Grammy recognition for his role in ‘Brown Skin Girl’ — a song by Beyonce.
