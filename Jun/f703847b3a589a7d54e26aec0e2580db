The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Monday, vowed to deal with criminals responsible for the growing insecurity in Nigeria. Buhari made the vow in an address presented on his behalf by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, at the first Progressives Youth Conference, organized by APC youths, in Abuja. He said, “As you are all aware, we are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them. “As I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly.” The President also scored his regime high in terms of service delivery and the even distribution of projects and appointments to all sections of the country. He enjoined youths to shun divisive tendencies and work towards promoting the democratic ideals which progressive politics is all about.
