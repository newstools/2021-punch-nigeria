THE Imo State Government on Tuesday denied reports that a correspondent of The PUNCH, Chidiebube Okeoma, was brutalised by security operatives from the governor’s office for covering a protest by a group of women. The women were reportedly protesting unpaid salary arrears. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, in a statement said contrary to the reporter’s claim, Okeoma was only questioned by the police for failing to properly identify himself after he was caught filming restricted areas of the Government House in Owerri after the protesters had left. Emelumba said it was curious that of all the journalists who covered the protesters, none was molested except The PUNCH correspondent. The commissioner added that it was also bewildering that someone who claimed to be a journalist could neither produce his ID card nor conduct himself in a dignified manner. He also dismissed the allegation that the chief security officer in Government House offered Okeoma N5,000 to treat himself of injuries from his encounter with the police. Copyright PUNCH.
