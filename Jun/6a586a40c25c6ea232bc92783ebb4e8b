Lions Clubs International, District 404B2 Nigeria, has partnered the Ogun State government  towards eradicating diabetes in the state . The club pledged to reduce the number of people living with diabetes in the state to the barest minimum through consistent awareness and sensitisation. The Lion Club Project Grant Administrator, Multiple District 404 Nigeria, Abiodun Adediji, disclosed this on Tuesday at the inauguration of free ‘Diabetes Screening\Test’  and  awareness campaign  by Lions Clubs International Foundation in Abeokuta . Adediji said over four million people were living with diabetes in Nigeria while 40,000 die yearly due to complications. He added that most diabetes patients in the country were ignorant of the disease. His words “We want to create awareness and treat those who have diabetes but do not know that they have diabetes. It is better to be aware so that they can live longer. “There are many Nigerians who have diabetes but are not aware. We want to achieve what our counterparts achieved on polio in Nigeria. We have been doing it and we will succeed on this.” The Deputy Governor, Noimot Salako-Oyedele who was represented by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, said,  “The intervention of the Lions Club aligns with the administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun’s vision of prolonging the life expectancies of people of the state. Our vision is to provide quality health care and to make it accessible and affordable.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
