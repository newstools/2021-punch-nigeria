THE Ekiti State chapter of the All Progressives Congress and its counterpart in the Peoples Democratic Party, have renewed their war of words following Wednesday’s release of the timetable for the 2022 Governorship election, by the Independent National Electoral Commission. While the APC expressed confidence that its candidate will succeed the governor, Kayode Fayemi, who is also a party member, the PDP advised the ruling party to prepare its handover notes. According to a timetable released by INEC, the Ekiti State Governorship election will be held on June 18, 2022. The State APC Publicity Secretary, Ade Ajayi, said, “The PDP is bedevilled with a myriad of crises that won’t allow it win any election. “Let me tell you that we are prepared and well-grounded to win the poll. APC is a more cohesive party. We are united under the leadership of Governor Fayemi. We are banking on our impressive performances to win and we are sure that the PDP will suffer another defeat again like they did in 2018.” However, his PDP counterpart, Raphael Adeyanju said “We know Ekiti (people) will reject a party that has disappointed them. A party that can’t fix their roads, that can’t provide employment for youths, that can’t effect promotions for workers, can’t continue to rule us. So, we are well prepared. “You can all see that the PDP demonstrated maturity in the way we handled our zonal congress while all issues relating to the state zonal congress were being resolved amicably without rancour.” Copyright PUNCH.
