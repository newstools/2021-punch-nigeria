The Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, on Friday sacked all his Special Advisers and Senior Special Assistants. The governor made the announcement shortly after presiding over a meeting at the Sam Mbakwe Exco chamber at the Government House in Owerri. The latest development came two weeks after Uzodinma sacked 20 out of his 28 Commissioners. The state Commissioner for information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, who confirmed the sacking, disclosed that the governor took the decision in the overall interest of the people of the state. Emelumba said that a board constituted by the governor had advised him to take the decision. The Commissioner said, “Yes, the story is true. The governor took the decision following a recommendation by a board he constituted in this regard. The idea is to make governance effective and is in the best interest of the people of the state. There is no ill-motive about it.” Our correspondent reports that the amount of aides affected are more than one hundred in number.
