The Delta State House of Assembly says the 7th Assembly has passed a total of nine bills out of 14 bills and 34 motions received in one legislative year. The speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Mr. Sheriff Oborevwori stated this during the commemoration of the 7th Assembly thanksgiving in Asaba. He said, “The 7th Assembly so far received a total of 14 bills and 34 motions, in which nine were executive bills while five were private bills. “Out of 14 bills, nine have been passed, eight have been assented to by the governor while the remaining five bills were still undergoing legislative consideration. “As soon as we resume plenary, we will consider private member bill, not that we are paying attention to executive bills alone” The speaker who decried the current insecurity in the country said it is a threat to the nation’s democracy if an urgent measure is not taken to address it. According to him, it is true that our democracy is being threatened following the level of insecurity in the country because without peace there is no way democracy will strive. On the ongoing parliamentary strike, the speaker said Delta has put everything in place to ensure financial autonomy of the parliamentary, noting that the only reason why Delta PASAN is still on strike was that the strike is nationwide and if they do not comply, they would be sanctioned. He said an autonomous parliamentary would ensure an increase in dividends of democracy.
