A prominent monarch in Rivers State, Ateke Tom has backed the seven-day ultimatum given to the Federal Government to inaugurate a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission, even as he accused the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio of insincerity. This came a few days after the foremost Niger Delta ex-militant leader, Government Ekpemukpolo, popularly called Tompolo, called for the constitution of the interventionist agency’s board within one week. Tom who is the Amayanabo (King) of Okochiri Kingdom in Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State and former leader of the Niger Delta Vigilante Force said this in a statement issued in Port Harcourt on Friday. Tom in the statement signed by his Chief of Staff, Tamunokonba Akaluogbo, said he was backing Tompolo due to the continued insincerity and open deceit allegedly adopt by the Niger Delta Affairs Minister, Senator Godswill Akpabio in handling the affairs of the NDDC and the region at large. He called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to show his sincerity for the development of the region and respect for its stakeholders by ensuring the board was inaugurated without further delay. The statement read, “It is clear that Akpabio is deceitful and he means no good to the Niger Delta region particularly the Ijaws given his attitude towards reconstituting the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. “Time and time, the Minister had failed in his promises and he is using the forensic audit as a decoy for his selfish aims. “I urge him to do the needful before the region tint towards upheaval of breakdown of law and order again because his ineptitude and lack of genuine concern for the demands of people are capable of degenerating into violence which I don’t pray for.”
