The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong; and a former Head of State, Gen Yakubu Gowon (retd.), were among those who paid tributes to a former Chief of Defence Staff, Lt Gen Joshua Dogonyaro (retd.), who died recently at 80. At Dogonyaro’s funeral which held on Friday in Jos, Buhari and others described the deceased as a patriotic, brave and disciplined officer, who gave his best to serve Nigeria. Buhari, who was represented by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.), said Dogonyaro was a thoroughbred officer whose achievements in the Nigerian Army remained a reference point and motivation to younger officers. Buhari said Nigeria remained grateful to Dogonyaro for his “gallantry, patriotism and diligence in service to the nation, particularly during his command of ECOMOG troops in Liberia.” In his speech, Lalong said Plateau State was not grieving over Dogonyaro’s death but celebrating “a worthy son who made Nigeria and Africa proud throughout his military career.” Likewise, Gowon, who was represented by Brig Gen Jon Temlong (retd.), said Dogonyaro showed early signs of greatness shortly after being commissioned into the army. The representative of Liberian President George Weah said the Government and people of Liberia remained eternally grateful to Nigeria and in particular Dogonyaro and other soldiers for the role they played in restoring peace to Liberia. Dogonyaro’s wife spoke passionately about her husband, saying he gave his best to the nation as well as to the Church. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
