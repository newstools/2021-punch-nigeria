The Chairman of the Lagos State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association has urged members of the public to utilise established professional channels in resolving issues related to medical negligence and malpractice. Adenekan said this during the Lagos NMA Leadership Retreat held recently with the theme, ‘The 21st Century Medical and Dental Practitioners: Leadership, Opportunities and Threats.’ “The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria has the mandate to investigate and resolve such concerns. The door of the association is also open for complaints about our members,” Adenekan said. The Lagos NMA chairman also lamented the insecurity situation in the country, saying there could not be an effective, efficient and equitable health care delivery in an atmosphere of insecurity. He said, “The insecurity in the country starting from Boko Haram insurgency has led to reduced access and quality of health care services, especially in the North-Eastern part of the country. “Many have lost their lives and those that are lucky now live in internally displaced person camps with overcrowding, poor sanitation, food and shelter shortage, as well as malnutrition and lack of access to basic health care. A former president of NMA, Prof. Wole Atoyebi, advised leaders of the association to ensure inclusiveness in all its activities. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
