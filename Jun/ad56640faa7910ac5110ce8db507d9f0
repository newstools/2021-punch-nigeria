Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, on Monday, accused mischief makers of printing and circulating 2023 Presidential campaign posters bearing his portrait and that of former Governor of the Central Bank, Chukwuma Soludo. This was contained in a statement titled, “Atiku preoccupied with helping to find solutions to Nigeria’s challenges,” signed by his Media Adviser, Mazi Paul Ibe, in Abuja. He said, “Our attention has been drawn to reports in a section of the media of campaign posters of His Excellency Atiku Abubakar and Prof Charles Soludo, an aspirant in the Anambra State governorship election in parts of Abuja. “Ordinarily, we would have ignored the reports, but for the interest of those who may be misled by the disingenuous plot. “We know nothing about the posters or those who may have promoted it. “It is obvious that this is a work of mischief. For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is of the PDP while Charles Soludo is of APGA. It is silly of anyone to attempt to drag the former Vice President into an election in Anambra which outcome will be determined by the people of the state.“ Ibe further said, “Atiku Abubakar is presently preoccupied with joining hands with other well-meaning Nigerians to help in finding solutions to the myriad of challenges plaguing our nation such as insecurity and economic downturn marked by joblessness and extreme poverty. “That explains why last Monday, the Waziri of Adamawa commissioned the headquarters of Standard Micro Finance Bank and two manufacturing plants, promoted by him in Yola to provide much-needed jobs and opportunities. “We wish to restate that the purported 2023 campaign posters in circulation linking Atiku to Soludo is the handiwork of mischief makers and should be ignored.“
