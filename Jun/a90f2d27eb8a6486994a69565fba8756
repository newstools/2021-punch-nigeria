CROSS River State Governor, Ben Ayade, has appealed to feuding leaders of the All Progressives Congress, in Cross River State, to sheath their swords in the interest of the party. The governor made the appeal at a dinner with APC stakeholders at Dorchester Hall, Spar Mall, Calabar, on Sunday. Ayade said, “The only way the APC in Cross River State can prosper is if, we put the past behind us and create a new focus, a new opportunity that will guarantee every one of us a seat at the same table. “Let’s therefore put an end to the factions in APC. I want to see Senator Owan Enoh, I want to see Pastor Usani cooperate, I want to see Alex Egbona, I want to see many more people embrace one another.” State Chairman of the APC, Mathew Mbu Jnr., described Ayade’s defection into the party, as “a great victory” for the APC, noting that it was just the beginning. Also, a former Senate Leader, Victor Ndoma-Egba, while speaking at the event, said “Your Excellency, welcome to a political party. You just left somebody’s personal estate to a political party. As a state, we are too weak and too vulnerable to be in opposition.” Other speakers included a former Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Ayade and Senator John Enoh.
