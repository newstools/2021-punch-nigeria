The Zamfara State Police Command has arrested 15 suspects for alleged conspiracy, inciting public disturbance and riot along the Gusau-Kaura Namoda Road in the Kaura-Namoda Local Government Area of the state. Briefing journalists in Gusau, the state Commissioner of Police, Husaini Rabiu, said, “The suspects, who were armed with different sophisticated weapons, blocked Gusau-Karan Namoda Road, where they embarked on unwarranted attacks and destruction of property while threatening the lives of innocent commuters. “Despite the presence of security operatives coupled with their efforts to persuade the rioters to disperse to their respective homes peacefully without force, the rioters turned down the security operatives and even attempted to attack them. “Our security operatives, being professionally trained to handle this kind of situation, eventually dispersed them and restored normalcy without the loss of life from both sides. “Consequently, 15 suspects who took part in the riot were arrested at the scene in possession of four locally fabricated guns, one cutlass, one catapult, three plugs used for the locally-fabricated guns, rolls of charms and six operational motorcycles.”
