The United States Trade and Development Agency has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to partner with InfraCredit, an infrastructure credit guarantee institution, to improve the profitability of infrastructural investments in Nigeria. This was disclosed by the acting Director, USTD, Enoh Ebong, in an emailed statement issued on Thursday. The statement quoted Ebong as saying, “The foundation of any strong partnership consists of trust, mutual respect, and collective prosperity. These principles are central to our relationship with InfraCredit. “USTDA’s three decades of project preparation expertise is an excellent complement to InfraCredit’s financial guarantees. “Under the partnership, they will leverage each other’s resources to overcome many of the constraints that inhibit the bankability of infrastructure investments in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
