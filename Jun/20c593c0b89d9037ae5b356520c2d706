A student of the National Open University of Nigeria, Maryam Musa, who was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure in 2019, has appealed to kind-hearted Nigerians for financial assistance to fund an urgent kidney transplant. The 24-year-old, in an interview with our correspondent, said she needed N12m to fund the kidney transplant. Maryam’s health challenges began when she was only 10, having been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes also known as juvenile-onset diabetes. She managed the condition until 2019 when her kidney functions failed completely. At the age of 13, she lost her father, and her widowed mother, Nneka Musa, a petty trader was unable to raise money for the kidney transplant to keep her alive. Nneka is imploring well-meaning and kind-hearted Nigerians, philanthropists, state governors, corporate organisations and non-governmental organisations to intervene and donate generously to enable her daughter access the urgently needed kidney transplant. She said, “The ordeal Maryam faces as a result of kidney failure is much; she contends with excruciating pain often, prompting her to be in and out of hospital frequently. Undergoing the transplant will enable her to overcome the current pain and discomfort occasioned by her present condition. Please help save Maryam’s life.” Maryam could be reached on her mobile numbers on 0813-195-9930 or 0812-277-7058, while donations can be made into her Access bank account number, 0104406217; account name: Musa Maryam Adaeze.
