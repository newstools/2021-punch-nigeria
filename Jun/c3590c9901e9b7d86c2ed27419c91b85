Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Tuesday asked the Benue State Government to establish its own security outfit, considering the spates of killings in that state. Visibly pained, Umahi, who was in tears, stated this at the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital 2, Abakaliki, on Tuesday, when he visited victims of the Sunday killings, saying the perpetrators showed some form of satanism in the dastardly acts. According to Umahi, Benue government exhibited the height of irresponsibility when it went on air on Tuesday and announced it didn’t know whether victims of the attacks were from Ebonyi or Benue states. He said, “What I saw this afternoon is nothing but an act of wickedness and Satanism. I do not know for any reason why people should be raping two-year-old children, inflicting machete cuts on one-year-old little children, killing their mothers, killing their fathers. Is it for what reason? “It is important that the people of Benue State form their own Ebube Agu to protect their own people instead of blaming Mr. President. Mr. President cannot be everywhere.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
