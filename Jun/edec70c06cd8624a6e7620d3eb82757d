The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is expected to pay a one-day official visit to Borno State on Thursday (today) to appraise security challenges in the North-East and inaugurate some projects in the state. A statement by the Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, on Wednesday titled, ‘Thursday: Why Buhari deserves Borno’s rousing welcome,’ confirmed this. Zulum, who said President Buhari was concerned about the humanitarian situation and sincerely committed to finding peace in the troubled state, added, “This is why he is visiting us on Thursday.” The governor said, “While I must admit that we still have security challenges, at the same time, if we cast our minds back to the realities before President Buhari’s coming, we would factually recall that many of our communities in northern, central and southern Borno, were mostly no-go areas. “President Buhari has regularly demonstrated deep compassion and love for Borno State. “Not long ago, President Buhari gave approval for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to establish a power plant for us in Borno. This aims to address our electricity problems in Maiduguri and environs. “President Buhari has also approved the take off of a Federal Polytechnic in Monguno. The President is also likely to approve a Federal College of Education for Borno.” Zulum said one of the projects Buhari was expected to inaugurate was the first phase of 10,000 housing units for the resettlement of IDPs and refugees.
