American rap artiste, Lil Loaded, the voice behind the 2019 viral summer hit song “6locc 6a6y” has died at 20. The Dallas County medical examiner’s office confirmed his death on Monday to USA TODAY that the young rapper, whose legal name was Dashawn Robertson, had died. However, the officials did not reveal the cause of his death. Meanwhile, Ashkan Mehryari, an attorney for the rapper, told USA TODAY the cause of death was suicide. “Sadly, I am able to confirm that Mr Robertson passed away today,” Mehryari wrote in a statement. The attorney told the Dallas Morning News that his client’s death was “very tragic,” adding, “He had a very bright and promising music career ahead of him.” Lil Loaded’s death comes a week after “6locc 6a6y” was certified gold on May 25 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Making the announcement via his Instagram page, the rapper wrote, “6LOCC 6A6Y Certified Gold… Who runnin dis (expletive) like me … dopest fanbase on earth.” The music video for the song has amassed about 29 million views on YouTube. The rapper’s follow-up single in October 2019, “Gang Unit,” became an even bigger hit with over 39 million YouTube views. Lil Loaded was arrested last year on a murder charge related to the October shooting of his best friend, 18-year-old Khalil Walker. A post on the late rapper’s Instagram account the same day as the shooting appeared to mourn Walker. According to The Dallas Morning News, it read: “So much love fa u they thought we had the same mama … ima see u soon.”
