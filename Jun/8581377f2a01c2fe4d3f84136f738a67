The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has described Zambia’s founding father and independence nationalist, Kenneth Kaunda, as “one of the greatest African and world leaders of all time who loved his country and people profoundly.” Kaunda died at a military hospital in the capital, Lusaka, where he was being treated for pneumonia on Thursday. He was 97 years. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Thursday titled, ‘Kaunda was a great patriot who loved his people profoundly, says President Buhari,’ quoted the President as saying, , “I have received his passing with great shock because I knew his contributions to the development of not only Zambia but also Africa at large.” The statement added, “According to President Buhari, ‘we can’t forget in a hurry how Kaunda gave shelter to anti-apartheid freedom fighters from South Africa and former Rhodesia.’ Al Jazeera reports that Kaunda ruled Zambia from 1964, when the southern African nation won its independence from Britain, until 1991, and afterwards became one of the most committed activists against HIV/AIDS in Africa.
