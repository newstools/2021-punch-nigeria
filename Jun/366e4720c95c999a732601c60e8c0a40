OSUN State Government on Wednesday said it would conduct headcount of migrants in the state and register herders with a view to providing them with personal identity cards. The state government also said the data capturing it would conduct for herders was to enhance their proper profiling of the herders residing in the state. It further explained that the effort was to strengthen the cordial relationship and peaceful co-existence between the Fulani/Bororo herders and Yoruba crop farmers. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor, Ismail Omipidan, said the decisions were part of resolutions reached after a meeting convened by the leadership of the state Committee on Peaceful Co-existence Between Fulani/Bororo farmers and Crop Farmers held with the heads of Fulani and Bororo known as “Serikis” in Osogbo. Also speaking after the meeting, the Chairman of the committee, Mudasiru Toogun, said the decisions were necessary as part of efforts to update the statistics and data of immigrants living in the state.
