THE organised labour, comprising Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress, said on Tuesday that members of the unions would be mobilised for a mass protest in Nasarawa State. The state Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress, Yusuf Iya, made this remark at a press conference on Tuesday in Lafia, the state capital. Iya explained that the organised labour and the state government had reach an agreement, adding that the unions noticed that an indicting clause was included in the document the day the agreement was to be signed, which forced leaders of the unions to shun appending their signatures. “In the event that the allocation from the federation account decreases or reduces, government shall not hesitate to go back to the old salary without the promotion being implemented,” a part of the clause, which was pointed out by Iya, read. Iya said, “Our resolution is that so long as the government does not expunge that clause which we describe as satanic, we are not going back on the industrial action.” The union had complained about lack of promotion, annual increment of salaries, training and non-payment of gratuity, among others. On his part, the Chairman of TUC, Mohammed Doma, said the government was not sincere and ready to implement the demands of the unions. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
