THE Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, has begged the Federal Government to implement Monday’s Abuja Federal High Court judgment ordering the payment of $951m as shortfall in oil derivation revenue to the state. Diri made the appeal in his reaction to the judgment at the Government House, Yenagoa, on Wednesday. This was contained in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah. He said the money was owed the state based on the Constitution and the 13 per cent derivation principle. Diri, who said his administration was open to dialogue with the Federal Government to amicably resolve the matter, noted that constant litigations would not engender cordial relationship between states and the centre. The governor said, “Let me use this opportunity to appeal to the Federal Government to please implement the consent judgment that has been delivered.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
