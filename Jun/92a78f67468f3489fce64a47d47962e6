Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, on Friday denied the reports that he had been invited for questioning by the Department of State Services. The invitation, which was confirmed by the DSS spokesman, Dr Peter Afunaya, was believed to be in response to the cleric’s remarks about the military. When asked for the reason the Islamic cleric was invited, Afunaya said, “It is not out of place for it (the service) to invite any person of interest.” The Kaduna-based cleric was alleged to have made disparaging remarks about the military during his recent interview on national television. But he has denied the allegation, saying there was nowhere he categorically accused the military in the course of the interview. However, Gumi in an interview with Channels Television after presiding over a Jummat service at the Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna State on Friday, denied the invitation, saying everything he had done with bandits inside and outside the forests were known to security agencies. He said, “Nobody invited me for questioning or any arrest, I can say that categorically. “When I went into the forest, I went there with the police, with the knowledge of the DSS, traditional rulers and the Fulani leaders. I never went alone.” The cleric also denied making any disparaging remarks about the military during his recent live interview on national television. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
