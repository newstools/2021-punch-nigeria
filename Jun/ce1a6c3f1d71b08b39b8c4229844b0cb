The Desk Officer of the Child Rights Abuse/Trafficking Unit in the Ebonyi State Ministry of Justice and Social Development, Mrs Ijeoma Ajah-Nwachukwu, on Monday, lamented the increasing rate of child theft and violence against women, girls and children in the state. According to her, over 22 cases of child stealing were recorded between 2020 and 2021, adding that the ugly trend was on the rise in the state. Ajah-Nwachukwu spoke at a four-day media dialogue, themed, ‘Ethical Reporting and Advocacy to Eliminate Violence Against Women and Girls for Ebonyi and Cross States.’ The event, sponsored by the Spotlight Initiative, a European Union/United Nations-funded initiative, and aimed at eliminating violence against women and girls in Nigeria, was attended by journalists from different media houses. Ajah-Nwachukwu said, “Children are being abused and the perpetrators are living in our environment; what are we doing about it as media practitioners? Children are being stolen and mothers suffer it most. What have you done about it as journalists? In our ministry, we have over 22 reported cases of stolen children; child stealing is on the increase in our state.” The Gender Desk Officer of the Ebonyi State Police Command, DSP Loveth Okwor-Ogbuanya, said, “Gender-based violence is an offense and it is the duty of all to report offenders to the police. Issues of child stealing and disappearance are on the rise in Ebonyi State.” In her brief presentation, the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative Communications Coordinator at UNICEF, Khadija Nuhu, charged journalists to open up discussions with the initiative’s partners and resource persons to deepen their roles in ending violence against women and girls.
