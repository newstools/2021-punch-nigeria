Bandits have released 11 women out of the 28 abducted in the Kabode Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The kidnappers had initially demanded N30m as ransom, the community said. Sources said the kidnappers dragged the women out of their houses and zoomed off. One of them said, “They released 11 women after we paid N16m ransom, but they are still demanding N17m before releasing the other 17 women.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
