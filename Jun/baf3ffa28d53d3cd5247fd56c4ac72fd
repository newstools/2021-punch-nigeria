Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State has suspended the management of the Zamfara Roads Traffic Agency. This followed a series of complaints of extortion by the public against officials of the agency. In a statement on Thursday, the Permanent Secretary, Cabinet Affairs, Alhaji Yakubu Haidara, said, “The suspension followed the directive from Governor Bello Mohammed to that effect.” According to the statement, the development is a result of increasing complaints from members of the public on the conduct of the traffic officials. He said the activities of the agency would be overseen by a joint task force of the police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Vehicle Inspection Service and the Federal Road Safety Corps. Meanwhile, over 200 commercial drivers blocked the Gusau-Zaria Road in the early hours of Thursday, protesting against what they called ‘illegal extortion’ by officials of the traffic agency. The protest, which began around 7am and lasted for about two hours, brought socioeconomic activities to a halt. Speaking to journalists during the protest, the Chairman, Zamfara State Truck Drivers Association, Alhaji Lawali Danda said, “Beside enforcing heavy tax on our members, ZAROTA officials also subjected them to a series of maltreatment and dehumanisation. “ZAROTA collects up to N50,000 from a driver and that alone discouraged many truck drivers from coming to the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
