The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Monday, congratulated the newly-elected President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi. His congratulatory message was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled, ‘President Buhari greets new Iranian President, says our nations will work towards closer cooperation.’ The President was quoted as saying that the election of Iran’s new president “once again reinforces the centrality of the will of the people to the success of democracy anywhere in the world.” He also reportedly said that “Raisi deserves his victory in the presidential election.” President Buhari explained that “democracy affords voters the opportunity to change or re-elect their representatives by peaceful means.” He described Raisi as “a consummate politician with experience to lead his country to greater heights and a better future.” President Buhari urged Iranians “to brush political differences aside and support Raisi to succeed in efforts to help the country overcome its challenges, including the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the crippling sanctions imposed on the country.” While congratulating Raisi on his victory, Buhari advised the President-elect “to unite the country for the sake of protecting the common interests of Iranians that transcend party lines.” “May God guide and grant you wisdom in the discharge of the heavy responsibility your election entails,” Buhari added. Buhari prayed for God’s guidance and wisdom in the discharge of Raisi’s new responsibility as President of the Islamic republic.
