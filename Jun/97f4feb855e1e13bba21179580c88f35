MODAKEKE community in Osun State on Sunday appealed to the state and Federal Governments to upgrade the area office into a full-fledged local government area. The Ogunsua of Modakeke, Oba Moses Oyediran, made the demand during this year’s edition of the Governor’s Family Meeting organised by the Office of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement. Oyediran said, “The people of Modakeke cannot wait to start enjoying the benefits of a full-fledged local government administration. Granting the request would bring succour to the people. “This is not unconnected to the fact that Modakeke, with a large population of people, is having a shortfall in political representation because it is just an area office. It is also at a disadvantage in the area of grassroots governance.” He commended Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, for his development strides across the state. In his remarks, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Mr Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, who represented his principal at the event, reiterated the administration’s commitment to ensuring inclusive and participatory governance.
