The Gombe State Commissioner for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Muhammad Gettado, on Tuesday, expressed the state governmentâ€™s determination to transform the Wawa Zange grazing reserve as way of keying into the vision of the National Livestock Transformation Programme of the Federal Government. Gettado made this disclosure when he paid a courtesy visit to the Emir of Dukku at his palace in Dukku shortly after undertaking a tour of Wawa Zange grazing reserve to inspect completed and ongoing projects. Some of the projects inspected included the completed 20-bed capacity hospital, the ongoing construction of a veterinary clinic and a large expanse of ware hay currently being nurtured to maturity. The commissioner, who expressed satisfaction with the level of work at the grazing reserve, however, challenged the contractor handling the veterinary clinic to speed up work so that herders could begin to enjoy services to be provided there. He said when eventually completed, the grazing reserve will house six hospitals, six veterinary clinics, a milk collection centre, 16 boreholes and a modern abattoir to add up to the existing schools for nomadic education.
