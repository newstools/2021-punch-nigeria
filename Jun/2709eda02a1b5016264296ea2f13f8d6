The International Human Rights and Dignity Defenders’ Forum has called on the government at all levels to stand up to its promise of protecting the lives of citizens. The group, which spoke to our correspondent on Tuesday, emphasised that its core objective is to “build a society that is fair and just for everyone.” The president of the body, Mr David Vine, decried the state of the nation in which the value of human life had diminished due to insecurity. He said, “All fundamental human rights should be the right to life. The recent ugly development where life is becoming valueless, where nobody cares about the next person is becoming frustrating. The government must urgently do something about curbing it.” Vine also pointed at the tepid approach of the government to reports of kidnapping and called for sophisticated means of apprehending culprits. “When there are reports, they are supposed to take it in more civilized manner, not manually. For instance, if there is are reports of kidnapping cases, the security agents should immediately go into action and comb the forests. We should have CCTVs on our highways and drones to track culprits,” he said. The National Secretary of the group, Mr Ayo Akintayo, also tasked the government to secure the lives of Nigerians. “This is a civilized clime in the 21st century. But we are now going back into a Hobbesian state of things where might is right. The function of the government is to protect lives and property. We want the government to wake up,” he added. ”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
