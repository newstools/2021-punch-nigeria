7Star Global Hangar Limited, an independent private maintenance and repair overhaul firm in West and Central Africa, has been granted an Aircraft Maintenance Organisation status by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. According to a statement issued on Thursday, the AMO would help save Nigeria and the entire West African region over $1bn annually in taking aircrafts offshore for different aircraft checks. The statement noted that an annual aircraft maintenance which amounts to over $1bn spent in West Africa would now be used to create employment opportunities in Nigeria. The Chief Executive Officer, 7Star Global Hangar Limited, Isaac Balami, said, “The huge capital in aircraft maintenance we often experience, amounting to over $1bn that is annually spent in West Africa alone, is going to help to create jobs here in Nigeria.” He noted that the NCAA after a series of evaluations had granted it permission to carry out maintenance. “7Star is the first independent privately owned MRO in West and Central Africa. It is a stand-alone and we were registered in 2012 and since, then for about nine years, we have been back to back pursuing our licence and variation with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.
