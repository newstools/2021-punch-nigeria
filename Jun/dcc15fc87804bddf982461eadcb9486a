The Oyo State Police Command has said it has begun investigation into the gunmen attack against Igangan, a community in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state. There are claims that no fewer than 20 lives were lost during the overnight attack, but the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Adewale Osifeso, in his reaction to the killings was silent on the number of people killed, those injured and the extent of the properties destroyed by the gunmen. Some residents of the community told our correspondent that between 17 and 20 lives were lost in the deadly attack on the agrarian community. The PPRO said, “On Saturday at about 2310hrs, a yet to be ascertained number of unknown assailants invaded Igangan Town with dangerous weapons in a bid to create unrest in the town. “The unscrupulous elements were however repelled by a combination of Police Operational and tactical assets in concert with local hunters and vigilantes. Normalcy has since returned with an on-the-spot assessment in process. “Furthermore, the situation is being closely monitored and comprehensive investigations are ongoing to apprehend the perpetrators. Casualty figure would be known upon the completion of the ongoing comprehensive investigations.”
