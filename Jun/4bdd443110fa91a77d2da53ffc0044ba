The Chairman, Ogo Oluwa Local Government Area of Oyo State, Seun Ojo and the Alajaawa of Ajaawa,  Oba Thompson Adeyeye, have  said  two persons were killed, while  no fewer than 10 injured when some policemen invaded Ajaawa in the early hours of Tuesday. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Taiwo Adisa, the chairman and the monarch said this in Ibadan. They accused one of the traditional medicine practitioners based in the town, identified as  Ade Master, of  conniving  with others to use  policemen to attack the town. The council chairman said, “We were baffled that men of the Nigeria police would invade a community and cause tension and panic, even loss of lives. “As we speak, at least two persons were confirmed dead from the sporadic gunshots fired by the police team while at least 10 persons sustained varying degrees of injury.” The Alajaawa also accused Ade Master of  instigating terror in the area, adding that it was unfortunate that some law enforcement agents appeared to be backing him. A similar crisis had happened in the town last month and some houses belonging  to  Ade Master were said to have been burnt down. However, efforts to speak with Ade Master were unsuccessful as he did not answer repeated calls put across to his telephone. But he had,  while reacting to the previous crisis  in a voice message sent to journalists  debunked the allegations. Ade Master had said, “I am a traditional medicine practitioner, I am not a kidnapper  and no child had ever been reported missing since I started my business.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Adewale Osifeso, when contacted said the police would issue a statement on the matter very soon.
