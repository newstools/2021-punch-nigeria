The Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye (SAN), on Tuesday, said the country needed effective law enforcement to tackle the current war against corruption. Owasanoye stated this in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, at a stakeholders’ zonal dialogue on the implementation of the National Ethics and Integrity Policy. Represented by a member of the ICPC Board South/South, Dr Grace Chinda, the ICPC chairman blamed corruption on fading values of truthfulness, nationalism and respect for humanity which were parts of the Nigerian society in the past. He, however, expressed the hope that the National Ethics and Integrity Policy already launched by the President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd), would resuscitate the lost values of honesty and integrity. Owasanoye said, “The National Ethics and Integrity Policy is a child of necessity. It was conceived and delivered out of the urgent need to resuscitate and rejuvenate our lost values of integrity and honesty as a nation. “The values of yesteryears of truthfulness, nationalism and respect for human dignity have been lost in us; that is why corruption has become so rampant in the society.”
