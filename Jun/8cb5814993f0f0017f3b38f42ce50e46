Five management staff of the Sokoto State Primary Staff Pension Board, who allegedly diverted over N500m, have been granted bail by the Sokoto State High Court. The money was meant for the payment of pension and gratuities of some retired teachers in the state. The officials are Abubakar Aliyu, Hassana Moyi, Haliru Ahmad, Kabiru Ahmad and Dahiru Muhammad Isa, who were Secretary, Director of Finance and Supply, deputy Director of Finance and Supply, Accountant and Cashier of the board, respectively. The Presiding judge, Justice Muhammad Muhammad, granted them bail in the sum of N55m each with one surety in like sum who must be a resident of Sokoto and owned a landed property within the state. Earlier, counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Sa’ad Hannafi, had objected the bail application on the grounds that some of the defendants were flight risk. Hannafi said, “The defendants had jumped the administrative bail granted to them during investigation. There are high risk of interfering with the prosecution witnesses as some of them were at the mercy of the defendants.” But counsel for the defendants, A. Y. Abubakar, urged the court to grant his application as prayed, arguing that, the defendants, “are responsible men and woman as well as responsible civil servant of the state.” Usman Kaltungo, the EFCC zonal head, had alleged that, the staffers used forged vouchers, withdrew and shared monies meant for the payment of pension and gratuities of primary school teachers in the state. The case was adjourned till July, 26. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
