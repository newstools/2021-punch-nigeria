Surgeons in Nigeria under the auspices of the International College of Surgeons, Nigeria, have lamented the impacts of COVID-19 and the insecurity situation in the country on the health sector. The surgeons in a communiqué made available to our correspondent at the end of their 54th conference held in Jos, Plateau State, called on the federal and state governments to rescue the nation’s health sector. The communiqué signed by their president, Gen.Maurice Ezeoke (retd.) and Secretary, Prof.Lucky Onotai read thus, “The International College of Surgeons is conscious of the drop in the revenue-generating capacity of the nation on account of the aforementioned challenges. We nonetheless take the position that with the right political will, Nigeria can perform better than its current health indices suggest. “The College commends the efforts of the current and past administrations towards the provision of health care for the citizens. We think that the efforts are not far-reaching enough for the delivery of optimum health care. “We also believe that it is within the capacity of the government to do more for her citizens in the provision of health care and we stand ready to partner relevant agencies in efforts aimed at improving the country’s health sector through surgical outreach programmes.” Copyright PUNCH.
