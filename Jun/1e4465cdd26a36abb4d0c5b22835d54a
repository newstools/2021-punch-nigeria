The seven host communities of the Oil Mining Lease (OML 150) in the Niger Delta region on Thursday issued a quit notice to Conoil Producing Limited, operators of the oil fields, over alleged breach of the subsisting Memorandum of Understanding by the oil firm. The quit notice came on the expiration of the 14 days ultimatum earlier given Conoil Producing Limited by the host communities, comprising Ifiekporo, Uwakeno, Omadino, Ewekwara, Jaluwa Efueye, Aja Osolo and Obodo. The seven landlord communities affirmed that their resolve was reinforced by the proclamation made at the palace of the Olu of Warri and the Delta State Government that Conoil should “recognise and commence dealings with the Comrade Monday Agbeyi-led executive of the OML 150 Communities Consultative Forum, or should vacate our land.” The seven host communities, in a statement jointly signed on Thursday by their Chairman and Secretary, Pa George Mogbeyiteren, and George Mami, respectively, declared that they were “tired of the disrespectful disposition of Conoil Producing Limited for constituted authorities and of course, left with no other option than to issue quit notice to the company.” The statement said, “All we are saying is that Conoil Producing Limited should respect constituted authorities and start dealing with us to pave way for the development of our communities or the company should quit our land now.” Copyright PUNCH.
