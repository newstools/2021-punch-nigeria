One of the Yoruba Nation agitators, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, has visited Igangan, one of the communities in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State. Our correspondent gathered that Igboho stormed the town on Monday evening to sympathise with the people and to see the level of destruction carried out by the gunmen who attacked the town on Sunday morning. Many were killed during the attack and property were destroyed including the palace of the monarch of the town. Residents of the town told our correspondent on Tuesday that Igboho visited the town on Monday. Although Igboho’s spokesperson, Olayomi Koiki, could not be reached by our correspondent to confirm his principal’s mission in the town, the video of the visit to the town was posted on his Facebook page. Scores of okada riders were seen hailing him and riding beside the Toyota Hilux which conveyed him to the town. Igboho was seen waving at the people and acknowledging cheers from them from inside the vehicle. The Convener of Igangan Development Advocates, Oladiran Oladokun, also confirmed to our correspondent that Igboho visited the town but he said he was not around during the visit. Recall that Igboho had visited the town on January 22 over atrocities committed by suspected herdsmen.
