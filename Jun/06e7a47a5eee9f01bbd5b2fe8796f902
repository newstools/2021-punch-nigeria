There was panic in the Boluwaji area of Ibadan on Wednesday when a fuel-laden tanker fell on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Our correspondent gathered that the incident occurred early in the morning as residents and motorists plying the road woke up to meet the fallen truck. The crash was said to have caused gridlock in the area, which was later cleared as officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps moved in to ensure the free flow of traffic. The Sector Commander, Oyo State, FRSC, Uche Chukwura, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent, said no life was lost and no injury was recorded as a result of the crash. She said, “It was a lone crash involving a white tanker without number plate. Maybe the number plate was removed by the driver after the crash. But no life was lost and no injury was recorded. “The tanker fell off the road and I suspect it happened in the night, because we met it there this morning. The content has been emptied into another tanker and traffic is now flowing normally, but you know it will take time to clear the backlog.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
