THE Jigawa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has withdrawn the suspension of the member of the House of Representatives representing Kazaure/Roni/Gwiwa/Yankwashi, Federal Constituency, Gudaji Kazaure. Sequel to this development, the state Vice-Chairman, Caretaker Committee of the APC, Bello Sanda, has written a letter to the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC National Caretaker Committee. The letter titled, ‘Forwarding the Resolution by the Two-Third Majority of the APC Kazaure Local Government Area Party Executives, six out of eleven wards’ Chairmen and Twenty-One Out of Twenty-Seven Yamma Ward Party Executives,’ dated May 31, 2021, was obtained by our correspondent, in Abuja, on Monday. It read in part, “We condemn the unconstitutional and unlawful suspension of our member and respected leader, Hon. Mohammed Gudaji Kazaure, by the APC Chairman, Legal Advisor and two others. Sir, four people cannot make a decision on our behalf. “Sir, we highly regret the disgrace but soon, the party will investigate the chairman and three others.” The Kazaure Local Government Area Chairman of the APC, Hassan Lawan, had last week announced the lawmaker’s suspension over alleged misconduct and disrespect to the Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Abubakar, via a post on his Facebook page.
