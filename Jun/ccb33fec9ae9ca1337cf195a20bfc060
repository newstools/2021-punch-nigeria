A commercial bus driver, Elijah Shokoya, was on Wednesday remanded by a Lagos State High Court in Ikeja for allegedly killing an officer of the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency. Shokoya was arraigned on one count of involuntary manslaughter before Justice Oyindamola Ogala and pleaded not guilty to the charge. PUNCH Metro had reported that the LASTMA officer, Olawale Akinmade, died on Wednesday, January 27, 2021, after he was knocked down by a blue and black Opel space bus with number plate AAA 74 GG, which was driven by Shokoya. Akinmade was knocked down at Demurin Street junction inwards Mile 12, while controlling traffic, and suffered injuries to his head and body. The offence is said to violate Section 224 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and is punishable under Section 229 of the same law. Following his plea, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Olayinka Adeyemi, asked the court for a trial date and requested that the defendant be remanded in a correctional facility. The defence counsel from the African Women Lawyers Association, Abiodun Kolawale, prayed the court for a short adjournment to present Shokoya’s bail application. Justice Ogala ordered Shokoya’s remand in a correctional centre and adjourned the matter till July 14 for trial. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
