The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, on Wednesday, issued a stern warning to men of the Lagos State Police Command that hoodlums must never destroy or raze any police station in the state again. He handed down the warning when he addressed the men at the Command Headquarters in Ikeja, the state capital. Baba is on a three-day work visit to Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial nerve centre with over 20 million people. According to the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who welcomed the IGP to the state, 16 police stations and 13 police posts were set ablaze by hoodlums in the aftermath of the #EndSARS protests last October. Also, six policemen were killed in the attacks, 106 cops were injured while 62 patrol vehicles were burnt and some vandalised. Odumosu, therefore, appealed to the IGP to assist in rebuilding the destroyed structures for more effectiveness of the Command. The IGP, in his address, charged the cops to be alive to their duties and protect their lives and property, noting that “never again should your police stations be sacked by hoodlums wielding guns, sticks and machetes,” Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement titled, ‘IGP Baba Lectures Officers And Men Despite Heavy Rain In Lagos’. “Your welfare is being taken care of like never before, do not commit suicide by being unprofessional,” the IGP was also quoted as saying. Adejobi also said the IGP was not booed in Lagos on arrival contrary to a publication (not The PUNCH). “The publication is false, baseless and mischievous as the Inspector-General of Police was never booed, rather he was warmly received and celebrated by Lagosians,” the Lagos PPRO said.
