President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, Tonobok Okowa, says visa issues prevented Divine Oduduru and Raymond Ekevwo from attending the National Trials holding at the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos. While responding to our correspondent’s question on the absence of some overseas-based athletes on Thursday, Okowa said they were perfecting their papers and couldn’t travel to Nigeria. “Oduduru has qualified for the Olympics, but he is still working on his visa, so he isn’t able to come here because he has been given one visa out, so he would rather reserve it to go to the Olympics from the US,” Okowa said. “For Raymond, it’s the same problem. He has just graduated, so, his student visa is out, so he is preparing his papers so that he will be able to travel to the Olympics. But most of them are here, a lot of them came from the US and other parts of the world so, let’s see what they can do.” The PUNCH had reported on Thursday that Oduduru, Ekevwo and Ruth Usoro were some of the overseas-based athlete missing at the national trials.
