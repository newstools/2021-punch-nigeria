THE Sarkin Fulani of Igangan, Alhaji Salihu AbdulKadir, who was recently banished from the community by a Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, has for the umpteenth time denied any involvement in the crisis rocking Igangan community in the Ibarapa North Local government of Oyo State. AbdulKadir told newsmen in Ilorin, Kwara State on Thursday that neither he nor his family was involved in the killings of innocent souls in Igangan since the crisis started. He also denied that one of his children was killed during last Saturday’s killing in Igangan. The Sarkin Fulani who alleged that members of  Odua Peoples Congress killed eight Fulani men in Igangan and Elekokan, near Igangan during the week, called on both the state and the federal governments to probe the crisis in the area with a view to bringing the perpetrators to book. Alleging that the utterances of Oyo State Governor’s Special Adviser on Security, Fatai Owoseni, were tantamount to encouraging Sunday Igboho and the likes to foment trouble in the area, AbdulKadir, however, commended Governor Seyi Makinde for his mature reaction to the issue of the latest attacks in Igangan where scores of people were killed. AbdulKadir denied claims that one of his children was killed during the recent crisis in the town. He said, “I want to tell the whole world that my family and I were not involved in Igangan crisis. Since the crisis began about four months ago, we have relocated from Igangan. None of my children was killed in the recent crisis because they are not residing there anymore.” Copyright PUNCH.
