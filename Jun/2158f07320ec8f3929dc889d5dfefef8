The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday fixed July 6 for the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission to arraign former Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof Dibu Ojerinde, for alleged N900m fraud. Justice Obiora Egwuatu stated this on Monday after counsel for the ICPC, Ebenezer Shogunle, opposed the terms of the plea bargain application the defence counsel, P. A. O. Olorunnisola, planned to file before the court. Recall that the operatives of the anti-graft agency had on March 15 2021, apprehended Ojerinde, in Abuja following allegations of misappropriation of funds. The ICPC accused Ojerinde of alleged multiple frauds while serving as Registrar at JAMB and the National Examination Council. When called for arraignment, counsel to the defendant, Olorunnisola, told the court that measures were underway for a plea bargain. A plea bargain is an agreement between prosecutor and defendant in which the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for clemency or an arrangement to drop other charges. However, Shogunle, disagreed with Olorunnisolaâ€™s submission, declaring that the ICPC disagrees with the terms in the application. Justice Egwuatu held that since the prosecution did not agree with the terms forwarded by the defence, a written correspondence should be filed to that effect. He adjourned the hearing until July 6.
