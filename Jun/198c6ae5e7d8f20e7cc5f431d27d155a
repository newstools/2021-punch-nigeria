Braingrace Group Limited has urged the Federal Government to prioritise ambulance service in delivering quality health service to the people. The Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Dr Akeremale Stephen, at the unveiling of a medical ambulance plant in Agbara, Ogun state, said it was imperative to deliver an efficient emergency medical treatment service to reduce the rate of mortality in the country. Stephen, in a statement on Tuesday, said the initiative  aimed at providing prompt and efficient emergency medical service to the people. “The ambulance service is one of the very many aspects of medical practice that is key in moving patients who are indisposed from one place or point to another for prompt medical attention. “Ambulance service requires speed to eliminate the delays in access to health care which can indeed reduce high mortality rates, hence, we unveil the ambulance plant system to provide prompt and efficient emergency medical service to the people. “In my years of experience in the accident and emergency department of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, I observed many people that were brought dead had no business dying but the mode of transportation,” he said. The Deputy Director, Nursing, LUTH, Olufemi Folakemi, in the statement, said the transportation method and medical care during transits by experts could resuscitate and revive a patient, stressing the need for relevant bodies, corporate and foreign firms to embrace the ambulance service delivery of Braingrace group.
