Eight persons have been killed, while 18 others were injured as factional cult members clashed in Onyagede, in the Ohimini Local Government Area of Benue State. A former chairman of the area, Musa Alechenu, disclosed this to journalists on the telephone on Monday. He said the clash was between the Vikings and Black Axe, adding that it had lasted for five days. Alechenu said many residents had fled the area in large numbers. He said all efforts to get security operatives to the area to maintain peace, proved abortive. “I tried to reach the Commissioner of Police, Madaki Audu, without success. The Assistant Commissioner, Operations, assured me that they are mobilising men to the area but they did not come. Even the Divisional Police Officer for Ohimni, who came with his men, immediately pulled out. “As I speak to you, there are dead bodies here. I spoke with the Deputy Governor, Benson Abounu, who promised to reach out to troops of  Operation Whirl Stroke,” Alechenu said. Efforts to get the state Police Public Relations Officer DSP, Catherine Anene, failed as calls made to her mobile phone rang out. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
