The Abia State University, Uturu, has disassociated itself from a video that went viral showing a soldier being beaten by a mob. The ABSU’s Public Relations Officer, Chijioke Nwogu, in a press release, said the attention of the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Onyemachi Ogbulu, and management of the varsity was drawn to the “online video allegedly showing some hoodlums attacking an army officer in a yet-to-be-ascertained specific location in Uturu.” “The university wishes to dissociate itself from such an ugly incident, as the students are presently on break, and warns mischief-makers in the habit of spreading false information trying to link the university to the alleged incident to desist forthwith. “The university appreciates the support and assistance of all security agencies, including the military, in the fight against all forms of criminality and their efforts in providing security within the university community. “We advise the students returning from break and the entire university community to go about their legitimate businesses without fear of molestation”, the release added
