Gbenga Awoyale, the President-General of Orisun Igbomina, a socio-cultural association for Igbomina people, has warned supporters of the Kwara State chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress, to close ranks to avoid a return of the Bukola Saraki-led era in the State. Awoyale said in a statement, in Ilorin, on Sunday. The statement read in part, ‘A key fact about our political party system is that everything centres on votes. If voters do not show up to vote for our candidates on Election Day what becomes of us? And it is only when there is party unity that we can talk about necessary things that should be done to outrun the opposition. “We tried for years before eventually ousting Saraki, if we are busy fighting each other he may return whilst we allow ourselves to get distracted.’ Awoyale commended the Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, for the infrastructural development of the state. He said the governor has given a good account of himself in the two years he has so far spent as governor. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
