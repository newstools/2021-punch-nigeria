Danish star Christian Eriksen, who suffered a cardiac arrest during his country’s Euro 2020 opener last weekend, will have a heart defibrillator implanted, the Danish Football Union (DBU) announced Thursday. The Inter Milan midfielder collapsed and required CPR during Denmark’s game against Finland in Copenhagen where he remains in hospital. “After Christian has been through different heart examinations it has been decided that he should have an ICD (heart starter),” the Danish football body said in a statement on Twitter. “This device is necessary after a cardiac attack due to rhythm disturbances,” it added. DBU provided no details on the potential consequences for the 29-year-old Inter Milan player’s future career. Eriksen “has accepted the solution” and it had also been “confirmed by specialists nationally and internationally who all recommend the same treatment,” DBU said. Players, such as Dutchman Daley Blind, have been able to resume their careers after being fitted with the device, which controls and regulates the heart rate. The announcement of the medical procedure comes hours before the kick-off to Denmark’s next match against Belgium, where a tribute to the Danish number 10 is scheduled to take place in the 10th minute of the match.
