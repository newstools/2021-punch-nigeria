THE Federal Capital Territory Administration has demolished over 349 illegal structures in Lugbe area of the nation’s capital. Some of the structures affected include religious centres, shops and houses. The Chairman, FCT Ministerial Committee on City Sanitation, Mr Ikharo Attah, who spoke with journalists after the demolition on Saturday, explained that the exercise was to ensure that the FCT was maintained in line with the best practices of orderliness and sanitation. Attah said, “We have been working on the Airport road for long without result, on Saturday; we had to take our time to correct the rot. With the numbers, we didn’t do up to 20 per cent. We will have to continue; otherwise we will lose the airport road. “Also, in line with town planning rules and to keep the city clean and safe, we are not going to be deterred. This comprehensive clean-up shows that FCT Administration is committed to keeping the city clean.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
