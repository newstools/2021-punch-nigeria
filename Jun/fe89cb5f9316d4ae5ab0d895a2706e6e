KANO State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has banned the activities of thugs in all political events and social gatherings in the state. This was contained in a statement signed by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, on Sunday. Ganduje expressed displeasure that miscreants were in the habit of brandishing sticks and dangerous weapons such as: swords, knives and cutlasses at public events in the state. He was quoted as saying, “We will not accept this and I assure you that I will deal with any politician who violates this warning. “During the flag-off ceremony of Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi Road, on the same day, political thugs engaged in unbecoming conduct. “I informed you that we are commemorating Democracy Day, with a line- up of activities that will witness the presence of the APC National Chairman, the governor of Yobe State and others. (sic) “As a result of this, the party is announcing a total ban on all forms of campaign for any politician during the said event. “I will personally order the arrest and prosecution of anyone caught brandishing weapons on this occasion. “Our politics in Kano is based on good reasoning and knowledge, focusing on a good agenda and not that of irresponsibility and madness.” Copyright PUNCH.
