The Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, has raised the alarm over the increasing proliferation of arms and the worsening insecurity in all parts of the country. He spoke when the Theatre Commander of Operation Restore Peace in the South-South and South-East, DIG Moses Jitoboh, led a delegation of senior officers to pay him a courtesy visit at the Government House, Yenagoa, at the weekend. The governor, represented by his deputy, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, called on the Federal Government to adopt a holistic approach in the fight against insecurity in the country, particularly in the North. Diri noted that although peace was being threatened in all geopolitical zones of the country, special attention must be given to the Northern region in tackling the issues of porous borders, alleged influx of foreign herders and the unabated farmers-herders clashes. The governor said, “The arms that are being circulated, we don’t know where they are coming from. So, we want to request that this same effort you are making here should go round the country, so that there will be peace everywhere in the country. “We will be happier if the entire country is peaceful rather than having peace only in our state. So, we want to use this opportunity to call on the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and the police to do something about what is happening in the North.” Jitoboh explained that he was in the state to inaugurate the task force set up by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to combat insecurity in the South-South and South-East regions. He acknowledged that Bayelsa was the most peaceful in the region and thanked the state government for its continued support to the police.
