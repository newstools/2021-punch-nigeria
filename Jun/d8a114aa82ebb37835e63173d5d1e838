The race to the finals of the Nigerian Idols reality television show has become hotter as the top four contestants have emerged. Following the eviction of Faith Jason, the top four contestants ― Atela Francis, Akunna, Comfort Alalade, and Kingdom ― will continue to battle it out on the Nigerian Idol stage with hopes to earn the title of the Nigerian Idol. After the contestants had a joint performance of ‘One Love’ by the legendary Bob Marley, they all waited to find out which one of them had advanced to the next round of the live performance. Atela Francis was the first of the five to make it to the top four. He sang Bob Marley’s ‘Nuh Woman Nuh Cry’, which earned him praises from the guest judge, Praiz. Francis’ second performance of Marvin Gaye’s ‘Sexual Healing’ earned him more commendation from Praiz, who remarked on his exceptional versatility. Akunna was the second contestant to advance to the top four. Her first performance was 90s chart-topper, ‘It Wasn’t Me’, by Shaggy. Seyi Shay commended her and added that she would not be surprised if the 23-year-old lawyer won the show. Her second performance was a rendition of “Fire to the Rain” by Adele. One of the judges, Obi Asika, complimented her voice, saying it was one of the strongest voices in the competition. Comfort Alalade was also lucky enough to garner enough fan votes to get a spot in the top four. Though her reggae performance earned her criticisms from the judges, however, her version of Carol King’s ‘Natural Woman’ made up for her previous performance. Kingdom beat Faith Jason to earn a spot in the top four. The judges commended his first performance of Majek Fashek’s ‘Holy Ghost’ while his second rendition of James Brown’s ‘A Man’s World’ earned him a standing ovation from the judges.
