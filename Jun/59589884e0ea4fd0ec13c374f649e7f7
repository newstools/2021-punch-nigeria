The United States of America has said that a new phase of Lassa fever vaccine clinical trials is set to begin in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This was disclosed in a statement on Monday by the Public Affairs Unit of the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria. According to the statement, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative was awarded €22.8m by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to conduct a Phase IIB trial of the IAVI Lassa fever vaccine candidate among adults and children in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The statement also disclosed that the vaccine candidate which uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector was now registered for use in eight African countries. The statement reads partly, “This joint award supports an international collaboration across Africa, Europe, and North America, called the ‘Lassa Fever Vaccine Efficacy and Prevention for West Africa’ which will also strengthen the research capacity of investigational sites where Lassa fever outbreaks and disease occur frequently. “In Nigeria, HJFMRI will conduct the study at its Clinical Research Centre (CRC) supported by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.” Copyright PUNCH.
