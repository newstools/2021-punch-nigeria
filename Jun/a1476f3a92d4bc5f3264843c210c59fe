It was a fiesta of glamour and glitz as celebrities trooped out last Sunday to show their support at the screening of ‘My Mirror’, a new movie directed by Gboyega Ashowo and produced by award-winning actress, Jumoke Odetola. Speaking on what inspired the movie, Odetola said, “The theme of the movie is on abuse in different forms, including that of parents to their children. A lot of parents unknowingly destroy the self-esteem of their children right from childhood through the things they say. These children then grow up to have low self-esteem and that affects their relationship with other people. “However, the abuse addressed in this movie is that of men. In this part of the world, society has made men to believe that they cannot express their feelings and pains. So, a lot of men suppress this anger. There are two things that happen in the course of doing this. It could lead to depression and at times, it could lead to a build-up of anger and emotions. When it gets to that limit, it’s like a breaking point. They could react the way they shouldn’t. Those are some of the things we addressed in the movie, coupled with the need for people to undergo therapy.” Odetola also stated that she had an exciting time acting in the movie alongside Odunlade Adekola, Seun Akindele, Allwell Ademola, Ayo Olaiya, Afeez Owo and others. Celebrities present are the premiere included Ayo Adesanya, Mr Macaroni, Seun Akindele, Korede Bello, Femi Adebayo, Ben Touitou and Jide Awobona. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
