A group, under the aegis of the New Reformation Unity Forum, has called for a referendum and constitution review, saying these will help the country overcome its current challenges. The convener of the forum, Mr Mutiu Okunola, at a briefing in Lagos, said the call for secession by some groups was not the best for the country. He said, “We believe that the Nigerian people need an immediate disconnection from the past systems by opting for reformation agenda to restructure the country’s fourth republic rules and constitution as a rescue mission to solve the present hardship and unnecessary misrule by colonial mentality. “With the present predicament in the country, we cannot be insensitive to the plight of the people; and that is why we call for the change of orientation. “We advocate a national referendum by the first quarter of 2022 to fine-tune and solve burning issues of secessions, agitations from some quarters, unemployment, in-security of lives and properties so that there would be true democratic governance and 2023 election.” Okunola said the current constitution of the country must be amended to give room for development. “The fourth republic was formed on failure due to the constitution that was adopted from Gen. Sanni Abacha, whose intention was to transform from military uniform to ‘Agbada’ in democracy,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
