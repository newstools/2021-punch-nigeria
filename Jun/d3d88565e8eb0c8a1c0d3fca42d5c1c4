The Federal Government has declared its plan to establish emerging technology centres across Nigeria. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, disclosed this on Tuesday during his keynote address as the special guest of honour at the Digital Africa Annual Conference, which held virtually. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday titled ‘Federal Government to establish emerging technology centres across the nation’ by the minister’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman. Pantami was quoted as saying, “The seventh pillar of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy focuses exclusively on developing emerging technologies among the populace. “One of the ways of achieving this has been through the establishment of the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and two virtual institutions currently building capacities in artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, Internet of Things, cloud computing, robotics and various other related fields. “The development of a National Policy on Emerging Technologies, as part of NDEPS, which will further support the establishment of emerging technology centres in Nigeria, is underway.”
