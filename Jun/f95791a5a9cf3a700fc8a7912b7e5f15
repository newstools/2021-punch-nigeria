Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Thursday, asked residents of the state to protect themselves against anyone who might want to attack them. Umahi, who observed that there had been reports of AK-47-wielding Fulani herdsmen in the state, said it was high time people rose up to defend themselves against external aggression. He stated this during an enlarged security meeting on Thursday at the Ecumenical Centre, Abakaliki. The governor said, “We note that there have been threats from herders with AK-47, sending text messages to Ebonyi State that they are coming to attack us. “We have resolved as a people to confront anybody whether he is a herder or criminal, that will come into the state with any gun to kill or anyone that enters the state with the intention to commit assault. “Protect yourself in all the nooks and crannies of the state; confront anybody that wants to kill our people. If the people want to kill with sticks, look for a stick; don’t look for security people to come, no sleeping day and night, protect yourself.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
