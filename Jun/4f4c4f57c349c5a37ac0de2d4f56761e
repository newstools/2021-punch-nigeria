A  police sergeant attached to the Igbeba Police Station in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, has been shot dead by suspected cultists. The killing of the sergeant occurred barely four days after an Inspector of police was killed by kidnappers, who abducted four Chinese workers at a village in Odeda. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the killing of the sergeant to our correspondent on Sunday. Oyeyemi said the deceased, whose identity was not disclosed, was targeted and attacked around 11pm on Saturday. The police spokesman told our correspondent that the cop was not on duty when he was killed by those he identified as cultists. He said, “It is true that a policeman was killed by suspected cultists. But the policeman was not on duty; he was off duty at the time. “I think he was going somewhere between 10.30pm and 11pm on Saturday when he was killed. He was no longer on duty at the time of the incident. “A suspect has been arrested. The suspect happens to be a member of the Eiye Confraternity.” Oyeyemi added that a manhunt had been launched for other members of the gang. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
