There was pandemonium on the NTA Road in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, on Tuesday, following a protest by bus drivers over the killing of one of their colleagues by a security outfit attached to the Rivers State Task Force on Street Trading and Illegal Motor Parks. It was gathered that the bus driver was shot while being chased by the task force officials for wrong parking in the area. The drivers, under the aegis of the Association of Urban Drivers, said their colleague was killed by an operative of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps attached to the task force. It was gathered that the driver had dropped off a passenger when the task force officials blocked him and an argument ensued during which he was chased before one of the NSCDC official fired a gunshot, which hit the driver on his genitals. The victim was rushed to hospital and was pronounced dead by a doctor, who said he had lost much blood. The protesting drivers abandoned their vehicles on the road to protest and described the action of the task force and the security operatives accompanying them as one too many. The situation caused gridlock on the road and the adjoining streets, leaving motorists and commuters stranded. When contacted, the spokesman for the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. He stated, “Yes, I can confirm that there was a little fracas over there between the driver and the task force, where they said a member of the civil defence attached to the team fired and the bullet hit the driver and he was taken to hospital. “Our men are still there trying to calm the situation and vehicular movement has resumed.”     ,, Copyright PUNCH.
