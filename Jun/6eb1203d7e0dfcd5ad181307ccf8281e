The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, has backed the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, for the Nigerian Presidency in 2023. The Olubadan expressed his support while receiving members of the Tinubu Vanguard, a support group for Tinubu’s presidency project in Ibadan on Saturday. The Director-General of Tinubu Vanguard, Dr Johnny Benjamin, said this in a statement on Saturday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.

The director-general said that representatives of Tinubu Vanguard were at the palace to intimate the Ibadan paramount ruler of their intention to deliver a Tinubu presidency in 2023, and to solicit his royal blessing. Benjamin added that the group was committed to ensuring that the Tinubu presidential mandate was actualised in the interest of national unity and cohesion.
