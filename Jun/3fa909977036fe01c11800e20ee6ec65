Daughter of a former vice president, the late Dr Alex Ekwueme, Mrs Chidi Onyemelukwe,  has described as worrisome the neglect and abuse of the local government system. She stated this during the second session of the fourth synod of the Anglican Diocese of Niger West. She said there were  ambiguities in Nigeria’s constitution that allowed  state governments to annex and treat local governments as their operational extensions whereas the system was supposed to be autonomous. Onyemelukwe who is contesting the November6 governorship poll of Anambra State on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, said, “Any meaningful approach to the issue must come through a rigorous constitutional amendment process. “If elected,  I will guarantee local government autonomy by holding local government elections within my first year in office.” The visiting bishop, Rt. Revd. Sunday  Adewole, the Bishop, Anglican Diocese of Kwara, spoke on the theme. ‘You are Complete in Christ: The Head of Principalities and Powers.’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
