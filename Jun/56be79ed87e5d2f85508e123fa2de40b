The Nigerian Medical Association, Imo State chapter, has denied one Dr Innocent Onwudike  caught for allegedly being involved in the trafficking of two siblings from Enugu State to Imo State. The NMA chairman in the state, Chidiebere Okwara, told The PUNCH on Wednesday that Onwudike was not known to the medical community in the state. Okwara said, “I have gone ahead to do a meticulous check and found his name nowhere in our records of medical doctors in Imo State. “He is no other than a quack, an intruder into the noble profession, a person of inconceivable demeanour, whose actions should not be allowed to destroy society. “The Nigerian Medical Association Imo State has continued to call on the government and security agencies to take proactive steps to curb this monster of quackery in the state. “We hope that this distasteful occurrence will arouse the agencies to stop quackery.” Copyright PUNCH.
