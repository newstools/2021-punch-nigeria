THE Chairman of the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission, Babatunde Osibodu, has denied allegations that OGSIEC was favourably disposed to a faction of the Peoples Democratic Party loyal to the late Buruji Kashamu. Osibodu spoke in response to allegations by the state chapter of the PDP that the commission was preparing to re-ignite the crisis by giving recognition to Kashamu’s loyalists. The Senator Bukola Saraki-led PDP National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee only recently brokered a truce between the Kashamu and the Ladi Adebutu-led factions of the party. The OGSIEC boss said, “We do not recognise any name other than officials of political parties. “Factions of political parties have come to us and we listened to them and accorded them due recognition. Never did we favour a faction at the detriment of the other.” He assured all parties of the preparedness of the commission to ensure a level playing field for all political parties. Meanwhile, the state chapter of the Action Alliance has expressed fears that the commission could become a tool in the hands of the ruling All Progressives Congress in its plot to rig the election. State leader of the party, Dapo Adeyemi, said this after the party held its primaries held in Abeokuta   ahead of the election. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
