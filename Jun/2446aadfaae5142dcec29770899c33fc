An ex-information minister during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, Alhaji Ikra Bilbis, has faulted the amnesty arrangements for bandits by the administration of Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State. Bilbis made the pronouncement in Gusau during the distribution of 30,000 bags of assorted fertilisers purchased by former Governor Abdul-Aziz Yari, and sold to All Progressives Congress’ supporters at subsidised rate of N4,750 per bag against the market price of N15,000. The former minister observed that the amnesty arrangement of Matawalle had only worsened the security problem in the state, adding that it was responsible for the increase in banditry activities. He said, “The amnesty arrangement of Governor Matawalle has only succeeded in giving more powers to the bandits than an ordinary farmer, because they (bandits) are treated as first class citizens. “That is why they are moving in the state, killing and abducting people even in the daytime.” Bilbis stated that it was wrong to dialogue with people who had no sympathy for their fellow humans. “You don’t dialogue with people who are senseless and heartless; you only fight them until they repent and surrender their weapons,” he added.
