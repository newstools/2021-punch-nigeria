Troops of the Nigerian Army operating around Sabo Birni border town of Sokoto State have neutralised three gunrunners and recovered weapons. The operation which happened on June 1, 2021, was made possible after the army got credible information that gunrunners were moving weapons on foot from Niger Republic into Nigeria. According to the Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, “The highly vigilant troops mounted a successful ambush along the suspected route close to Garin Naimaimai Village and neutralised the 3 gunrunners. “Items recovered include RPG bombs and RPG chargers, machine gun, AK47 assault rifle and other accessories as well as different calibre of assorted ammunition. “The Chief of Army Staff Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya commended the efforts of the troops and urged them to sustain operational tempo by dominating all the illegal routes around the border areas with Niger Republic to frustrate any movement of weapons and ammunition into the country.”
