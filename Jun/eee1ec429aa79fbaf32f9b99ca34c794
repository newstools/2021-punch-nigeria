AN oil and gas firm, Total Grace Oil and Gas, says the company is increasing its investment in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, to address the growing problem of unemployment. The Chief Executive Officer of the Total Grace Group, Dr Henry Akinduro, said this in Ibadan on Sunday at the inauguration of four additional filling stations opened by the company in the city. He stressed that apart from customers’ satisfaction, the goal of the company was to make sure that the youth were productively engaged, saying this would also ensure improvement in security. Akinduro said, “To create more job opportunities for the people that are not employed, we know we have to increase the number of investment in that environment and that is the reason we want to invest heavily in Ibadan. We want to use that to reduce the number of unemployed people in Ibadan.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
