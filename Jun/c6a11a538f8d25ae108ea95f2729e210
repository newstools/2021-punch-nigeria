Secretary to the Gombe State Government, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi, has revealed how he managed to complete his tenure as Vice-Chancellor of University of Maiduguri, despite Boko Haram activities in the North-East. Njodi prior to his appointment as the SSG, was VC of UniMaid, noted that he chose to ensure that the campus was in operation without fear of the threats from the terrorist group. According to him, he has a choice to either shut UniMaid or to leave it in operation. The former don who was appointed VC in the hit of the insurgency on June 3, 2014, made this disclosure during his acceptance speech on the title of Mayegun  (Ambassador of Peace), conferred on him by Oodua Youth Parliament. Njodi said, “I stood my ground and looked at Boko Haram to the face and said we will not close the University of Maiduguri. Do your worst.” “We got recognised by the federal government, where I was awarded National Productivity honours because of this. Things may be looking different but stand your ground.” While lauding the efforts of Nigerian Youths in promoting peace and unity in the country, the SSG said the elders had been the ones exhibiting bitterness and hatred. “While the elders are showing bitterness you (Nigerian youths) have brought water to douse the tension. I’m happy, If I should die today, I will die with a smile on my face because the youth, you are doing what is needed. After 51 years of fighting a worthless, needless war, we should have forgotten, buried that hatchet. Sadly, some people want to bring back bad memory,” Njodi. Also, Speaker, Oodua Youth Parliament Abdulmajeed Oyeniyi, hinted that the youth group singled out the SSG, due to his leadership whilst on camp and at the moment. Copyright PUNCH.
