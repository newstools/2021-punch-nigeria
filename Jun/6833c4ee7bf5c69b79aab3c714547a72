The price of bitcoin has jumped above $40,000 for the first time in June. This is coming after Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that his company would eventually resume bitcoin payments when there’s a clear confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage in a tweet. Also, El Salvador’s historic move to make bitcoin a legal tender last week has seen the digital currency on a sustained rise. “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with a positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,” Musk said. Bitcoin has spent weeks languishing close to $30,000, but is managing to stage a sustained comeback in recent weeks. According to CoinMarketCap on Monday, Bitcoin was $40,850.88 (3:49 pm). It had a 24-hour trading volume of $50,233,281,040. Bitcoin was up 14.23per cent. It had a live market cap of $765,330,459,515, a circulating supply of 18,734,737 BTC coins, and a max. supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
