Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation Americas, United States Chapter, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to provide employment for youths. In a letter jointly signed by its President, Eromonsele Idahosa, and other officials of the association, NIDOA expressed concerns on the need for increased education and employment rate of children and youths. “Government must move swiftly to reduce and ultimately eliminate the number of out-of-school children by guaranteeing access to education which should be compulsory up to basic education level,’’ the statement partly read. NIDOA also urged the federal government to implement policies that are capable of impacting job creation and entrepreneurship development, as the high unemployment situation is a ticking time bomb. The association suggested that youth should be mentored and engaged productively in nation building, as it urges the government to “provide skills acquisition training and gainful employment for them after completing their training.” “We are mobilising our members to invest in scholarships, skills acquisition, entrepreneurship and career development opportunities for Nigerian youth. The Federal Government is welcome to collaborate with us in this respect,” the association said. NIDOA assured Buhari of continued support and constructive role in national development, saying it is mobilising the support of Nigerian-American owned/managed businesses and not-for-profit organisations.
