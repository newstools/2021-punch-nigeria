Singer, songwriter and producer, Peace Oredope, aka P.Prime, has said that though they are often under-celebrated, producers operate a very important place in the music industry because they bring the dreams of artistes to life. The 18-year-old beat maker told Sunday Scoop, “I don’t want to be limited to being a beat maker. Among other things, I write, sing and direct live music. Besides, produces are very important in the music ecosystem because they bring the dreams of artistes to life.” P.Prime, who has worked with top artistes such as Olamide, Teni and Zlatan noted that he was planning to release an Extended Play album. He said, “I am thinking of releasing my own music. It would be more expressive because there is a limit to things one can do on other people’s songs.” The entertainer also added that his young age was not a factor in determining his output. He said, “Age means nothing to me. If anything, I consider myself privileged. I feel like the universe has put me on a pedestal and as a result of that, I am a voice for the next generation. I am well-brought up and very disciplined. I am also very much in touch with older people around me. Their rich counsel help to keep me in check.” His production credits include Like I Do (Fireboy), Gelato (DJ Cuppy), Egungun (Obesere featuring Zlatan), as well as 12 songs in Olamide’s latest album, Carpe Diem.
