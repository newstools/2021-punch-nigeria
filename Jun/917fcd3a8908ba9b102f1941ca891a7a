Bank growth in Nigeria is being driven by the use of digital financial services and bank agents, a report by Enhancing Financial Innovations and Access has said. The report said, “Of Nigeria’s 106 million adult population, 89 per cent now have access to mobile phone (either to own or borrow); 46 per cent have accessed a digital stored value account; 81 per cent own a phone; 45 per cent have active digital stored-value accounts; and 28 per cent are active digital financial services users.” According to the report, 19 per cent of adult Nigerians used banking agents in 2020 as against three per cent in 2016, while 29 per cent used payment platforms as against 12 per cent in 2016. It showed that remittance only grew by one per cent from 24 per cent in 2016 to 25 per cent in 2020. Savings accounts also dipped by one per cent from 28 per cent to 27 per cent. The report also said 36 per cent of Nigeria’s 106 million adults lacked access to banked services. It suggested that the actual number of financially excluded adults might have increased from 36.6 million in previous years to 38.1 million in 2020. It said, “Use of informal financial services also grew, with many Nigerians continuing to use a combination of formal and informal financial services to meet their needs. Only about one in four Nigerian adults are considered financially healthy (27 per cent), while 39 per cent are coping and 34 per cent are financially vulnerable. “There is a positive correlation between digital financial services and financial capability. Nearly 1 in 2 Nigerian adults do not use any formal (regulated) financial services. More than 1 in 3 Nigerian adults remain completely financially excluded.” EFINA also said population growth rate was outpacing rate of financial inclusion growth, and that the proportion of formally served adults was on the increase for the first times since 2014. “The proportion of formally served adults increased for the first time since 2014. While the percentage of financially excluded adults decreased slightly between 2018 and 2020, the actual number of financially excluded adults increased from 36.6 million to 38.1 million, as population growth outpaces the rate of financial inclusion growth,” the report added.
