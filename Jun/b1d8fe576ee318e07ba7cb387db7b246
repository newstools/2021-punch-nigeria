The gunmen that abducted the Eleda of Eda Ile in the Ekiti East council area of Ekiti State, Oba, Oba Benjamin Oso, have contacted the family and demanded N20m ransom. Oba Oso was whisked away into the forest by the gunmen on Friday when he and his wife were on their farm at Eda-Ile. His wife was said to have been released following appeal by the traditional ruler. A family source said on Sunday that the abductors on Saturday contacted the family of the traditional ruler and demanded N20m. The source said, “Their demand is on the high side, but when the family attempted to negotiate it downwards, they (abductors) switched off their phone. The entire community is troubled over the development.” The Ekiti Amotekun Corps Commander, Brig. Gen Joe Komolafe, had said, “All the security outfits in the state including police, Amotekun Corps, local hunters and vigilance groups are already in the forest searching for the monarch. We are on the trail of the kidnappers”. Also the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Police Command, Sunday Abutu, who said the law enforcement agent was not aware of the said demand for ransom, said, “The police are working with other locals to ensure his freedom and apprehension of the perpetrators. “We are concerned about kidnapping incidents, that is why our operatives are working round the clock to ensure they do not occur and when they occur, efforts will be activated to rescue the victims and apprehend the perpetrators,” Abutu said.
