The Federal Government has begun forensic auditing of projects executed by the Niger Delta Development Commission in Imo state. A forensic auditing firm, BBC Professional, which was contracted by the Federal Government is carrying out the forensic auditing process in the state. The leader of the team in the state, Gloria Wgwuenu, who spoke with journalists during the physical verification exercise of the NDDC projects in the state, assured that the team would do a thorough job. She said, “We commenced last Thursday because of the security situation in Imo State. Some other states have started before now. But because of the security situation, we are like the third batch that came in for the physical verification of the projects. ”So far, we have over 1,000 projects in this state and we just covered a few. We can’t say this is the specific project. ”We can’t specifically state this because we have different classes of projects. Some did not start, some started, some ongoing. Copyright PUNCH.
