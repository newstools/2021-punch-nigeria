The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has said he will defeat his political opponent, Mr Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party, if the latter proceed to the Supreme Court to challenge the verdict of the Court of Appeal on the last governorship election in the state . The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Wednesday upheld the victory of Akeredolu. The PDP has however vowed to challenge the appeal court judgement. The governor, who arrived Akure on Thursday and welcomed by hundreds of supporters of the APC, said, “I will win again at the Supreme Court if Jegede decided to challenge the judgment of the lower court.” Akeredolu promised that his administration would continue to deliver dividends of good governance across the three senatorial districts. Tinubu hails Ondo gov Meanwhile, the Nationa Leader of the APV, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has congratulated Akeredolu and his deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, for the Court of Appeal victory. Tinube, in a statement, by his Media Office on Thursday, said, The appellate court’s verdict was emphatic and clear endorsement of the sound judgment of the election petitions tribunal. More importantly, the Appeal Court decision stands for the vital proposition that the rule of law serves to protect the sovereign will of the people when expressed in free and honest elections. “By this judgement, the appellate court clearly shows that Governor Akeredolu and Deputy Governor Aiyedatiwa were the candidates whom the people of Ondo choose to pilot their affairs for the next four years.” Tinubu urged Jegede to join hands with Akeredolu for the good and development of Ondo State.
