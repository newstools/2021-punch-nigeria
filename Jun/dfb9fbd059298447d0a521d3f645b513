VFD Group Plc, a proprietary investment company, has said its gross earnings rose by 97 per cent in the 2020 financial year. The Chairman, Olatunde Busari, disclosed this while presenting the group’s 2020 financial statements during its annual general meeting in Lagos. He said the company delivered record levels of revenue and profit. He said, “Gross earnings grew by 97 per cent to N6.7bn (2019: N3.4bn), while the Group’s profit before tax grew year on year by 173 per cent to close at N4.1bn (2019: N1.5bn). The higher growth rate of profit before tax vis-avis gross earnings was a result of the business’ ability to keep expense growth rate lower than earnings; as operating expense for the year grew by 37 per cent to N2.6bn (2019: N1.9bn). Growing year on year by 85 per cent, total asset closed at N81.7bn (2019: N44.2bn), a reflection of the group’s ambition. In the year under review, he said, the group embarked on varying activities that were important to the journey ahead. “We continue to expand our business focus into industries and sectors that allow us to build a second-to-non ecosystem,” he said. During the year, he said, the firm finalised the acquisition of significant stake in Anchoria Investment Securities Limited and Atiat Insurance Brokers Limited. “Leveraging on their expertise and structure, and layering our own competences, these two companies provide access to new markets and allow us ringfence customer value chain as we grow,” he said.
