THE Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje, on Thursday called for military intervention in the state, saying bandits had taken over its forests and converted them to hideouts. The governor added that the bandits were gathering in Falgore Forest and might be planning to carry out attacks. Ganduje said this at a meeting with the service chiefs at the Defence Headquarters in Abuja. He said, “I am also here to seek the help of the Nigerian Army to sustain the peace in Kano State. Bandits have converted some forests in the state into hideouts. The bandits are grouping in Falgore Forest and may be planning to attack our people. “We are building houses, schools and hospitals for the herdsmen in some of the forests but we want the Army to commence activities at the Falgore Forest. “I plead with the Nigerian Army to quickly conclude work on the training depot at the Falgore Forest so that they can take over the forest.” Speaking, the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Yahaya Farouk, reiterated the commitment of the Army in conjunction with, other arms of the Armed Forces and security agencies to contain insecurity across the country.
