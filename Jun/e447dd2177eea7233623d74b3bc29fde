Manchester City winger, Riyad Mahrez, 30, has proposed to his girlfriend of 16 months, Taylor Ward. The Algerian national proposed on Monday during the couple’s vacation in Mykonos, an island in Greece, in the company of friends and family members, including Ward’s celebrity parents, Dawn and Ashley Ward — the former, a Real Housewives of Cheshire star, and the latter, an ex-footballer. A source for The Sun revealed that the custom-made engagement ring cost £400,000. According to The Sun’s source, “Taylor was not expecting this at all, and was utterly over the moon. She and Riyad make an amazing couple, and they’re so loved-up. Riyad chose the ring himself and had it specially made”. Ward, 23, who is a model and brand influencer, took to her Instagram page to share the news. “There’s no one I’d rather do this life with, here’s to a lifetime of us. Can’t wait to grow old together. I Love You”, the caption to Ward’s Instagram post read. In October 2020, it was confirmed that Mahrez is in a relationship with model Taylor Ward. Mahrez’s relationship with Ward began following his divorce from Rita Johal, whom he’d been married to for six years — since 2015 — and with whom he has two daughters.
