Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has ordered the immediate destruction of all criminal hideouts in the state to prevent attempt to undermine security. He specifically mentioned Ahoada, Elele, Eleme and Onne as flashpoint areas. The governor said criminals were already coming to terms with the reality that Rivers State was too hot for them to invade at will and attack security posts and personnel. Wike said these in a state broadcast on Friday, adding that his government had identified the hideouts, safe houses and secret places that provided both cover and comfort for hoodlums. The governor’s broadcast was captured in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, and made available to journalists in Port Harcourt. The statement read, “This was the reason we ordered the destruction of all the shanties and makeshift structures located along Elele to Ahoada expanse of the East-West Road to deny the criminals the opportunity to continue to undermine our security from these hideouts. “We have equally decided to destroy all the shanties, illegal shops and mechanic sheds along the Eleme to Onne stretch of the East-West Road, having discovered these places also as hideouts and operational bases for criminals and criminal activities in the state. “Consequently, I hereby direct owners of such shanties and illegal structures along the Eleme-Onne axis of the East-West Road to vacate the area within two weeks from today (Friday) as the state government will go ahead to destroy these structures without any further notice.” Copyright PUNCH.
