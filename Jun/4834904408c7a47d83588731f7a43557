The Department of State Services has reportedly invited controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, for questioning over his recent comments during an Arise TV interview claiming that Nigerian soldiers aid bandits’ activities. Our correspondent gathered that the controversial Islamic cleric was summoned to the DSS office in Kaduna State, according to the Hausa service of the Voice of America, monitored on Friday. But Gumi’s spokesman, Tukur Mamu, also in an interview with the VOA, dismissed the allegation against Gumi, saying there was nowhere in the TV interview where Gumi categorically accused the entire military. The spokesman explained that what Gumi said was that people have been saying and “even the soldiers have been saying that there could be some bad eggs amongst them”.
