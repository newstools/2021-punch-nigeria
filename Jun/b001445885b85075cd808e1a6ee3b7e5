THE Independent National Electoral Commission has expressed concerns over the safety of its personnel and facilities as the November 16 Anambra State governorship election draws near. Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, expressed these concerns in an address presented on his behalf by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Board of The Electoral Institute, Mallam Mohammed Haruna, at the 2021 annual Abubakar Momoh Memorial Lecture with the theme, ‘Security and elections: Implications for Anambra State governorship and 2023 general elections,’ in Abuja, on Wednesday. He noted that security had remained a critical issue with each election cycle in the country. Yakubu noted that the topic of the lecture was quite significant especially with the ongoing nationwide security challenges and attacks INEC facilities. “This challenge is more pronounced as the Commission will deploy 5,345 staff to officiate in the 2,673 Registration Centres nationwide. Naturally, we are deeply concerned about their safety even more than we are about the security of our property and materials. “More immediately, we are equally concerned about the Anambra Governorship Election that is scheduled for November 6, 2021, especially following the attack on the head office in the state. The commission, in collaboration with all stakeholders, is determined to tackle this challenge. “There is reason to be especially concerned about the Anambra State Governorship Election and eventually the 2023 General Elections. “To avoid any constitutional crisis these elections must be conducted in line with the constitutional timelines.” Copyright PUNCH.
