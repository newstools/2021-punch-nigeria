SUPPORTERS of the All Progressives Congress, under the aegis of Anambra APC Patriots, have asked all those who lost the just concluded governorship primary to accept defeat. The group urged all party leaders to support the winner, Senator Andy Uba, in the overall interest of the party. Eleven APC governorship aspirants rejected the conduct of the primary while accusing Uba of hijacking the process. The group made up of mainly former federal and state lawmakers spoke at a press conference, in Awka, on Wednesday. A former member of the House of Representatives, Victor Ogene, who addressed the press on behalf of the group said, “As it stands, the party and its rank and file have spoken. We, therefore, congratulate our flag bearer, His Excellency, Senator Andy Uba on his nomination. “In almost all elections, including those conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, such glitches are easily noticeable; yet, it does not vitiate the outcome of the contest. “As it is, the Primaries have been conducted and a winner announced by the chairman of the committee, Prince Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun State. “We, therefore, urge all our party members to accept the outcome, congratulate the winner and work assiduously for us to win the main election.” Copyright PUNCH.
