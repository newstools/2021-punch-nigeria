Three person were killed and many others injured after a tanker laden with Premium Motor Spirit, otherwise known as petrol, exploded in the Amoke community, Apa Local Government Area of Benue State on Monday. The incident was said to have resulted from brake failure on the part of the tanker. It was gathered that the tanker exploded around 7.15am about three meters to Ugbokpo, headquarters of the local government council. An eyewitness, who identified himself simply as Tina said, “The incident happened early this morning (Monday); it is like the tanker suffered a brake failure.” The scene of the latest tanker explosion is not far from Oshigudu in the Agatu Local Government Area of the state, where two similar incidents occurred in April this year. When contacted, the Sector Commander, Benue State Command, Federal Road Safety Corps, Yakubu Mohammad, confirmed the incident and said three persons, including the driver of the tanker, lost their lives. The FRSC boss blamed the accident on brake failure and said the fire had been extinguished as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
