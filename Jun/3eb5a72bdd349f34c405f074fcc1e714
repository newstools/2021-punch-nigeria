The Future Project says it is launching the Local Government Performance Report to enhance accountability and efficiency in governance at the grass roots. A statement by the organisation said the move was in furtherance of its vision to deepen accountability in governance by empowering Nigerians with the necessary information to engage local government administrators and assess their performance in the delivery of public services. The Senior Advisor, The Future Project, Bukonla Adebakin, highlighted some of the reasons for the report and the expected impact. She said, “With an overall aim to create a culture that emphasises citizens’ rights to demand information on government activities without fear or hesitation, the project is designed to address unmet public expectations at the grass roots created by an absence of open, transparent and accountable government practices. “The local government performance report is a part of our YMonitor accountability project which is aimed at highlighting crucial accountability and governance issues at the state and Federal level. In reality, local government administration is meant to pivot public goods and developmental projects at the grassroots as everyday people may never have the platform to make their demands known to the state governments. However, development has not yet thrived up to public expectations.” According to Adebakin, the initiative will commence from the country’s economic capital, Lagos State, and will be conducted both through an online survey and offline distribution of surveys to sample feedback and opinions.
