English Premier League club, Leicester City, have identified Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Yves Bissouma as a potential replacement for Nigeria international, Wilfred Ndidi. The combative midfielder has been heavily linked with a move away from The King Power Stadium outfit, with Manchester United and Real Madrid among the top clubs interested in the signature of the 24-year-old. Ndidi joined the Foxes from Genk in January 2017 and still has a contract with the Foxes until 2024. Since his arrival, Ndidi has been an integral part of the team and one of Brendan Rodgers most trusted players. Ndidi helped the Foxes to an FA Cup win last season and according to reports, he may have played his last game for the club with several top European clubs vying for his signature. According to a French website, getfootballnewsfrance.com, Leicester are already preparing for life after the Nigerian. “Premier League side Leicester City are prioritising Brighton midfielder Yves Bissouma, in the event that Nigerian international central midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is to depart the Foxes this summer,” the website was quoted as saying. “Brighton are seeking €35m for the ex-Lille man, with other Premier League clubs interested in his services. “The Leicester board view the arrival of Boubakary Soumaré as separate to the Ndidi situation and that the current Lille man, who is joining for €25m, including bonuses, is not seen as a replacement for the Nigerian.” Copyright PUNCH.
