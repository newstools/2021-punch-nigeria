World Athletics say they are still studying the parallel elections in Birnin Kebbi and Abuja, which produced Shehu Gusau and Tonobok Okowa as presidents of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria. In an email sent to our correspondent by WA’s Head of Communications, Nicole Jeffery, the dispute between both factions is viewed as an internal issue. The WA however urged both factions of the AFN to resolve their disputes quickly so that it won’t affect athletes preparing for the 2020 Olympics. “World Athletics is verifying the information we have received following the elections in Nigeria and we will decide on any next steps after we complete that process, but this remains an internal dispute at this time. “Our primary concern is that Nigeria’s athletes should not be impacted by this issue and we urge all parties to come to a swift resolution for the sake of the athletes,” the WA said in the letter. The AFN had been in crisis since 2019 after the Gusau-led board of the AFN declared autonomy from the sports ministry at a congress in Awka, Anambra State. This resulted in the suspension of Gusau and his supporters by other members of the board led by then AFN vice president Olamide George. Gusau was eventually impeached and George made the acting president. He however approached the court to quash his suspension and impeachment, and won at the Federal High Court and the Court of Appeal. The sports ministry, however, failed to recognise him as the AFN president. With a bid to resolve the crisis, the WA and the Confederation of African Athletics sent a representative to Nigeria to meet with the sports ministry and both factions in April, where they were mandated to hold an election latest June 14.
