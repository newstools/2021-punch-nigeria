THE Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission on Wednesday, started the screening of councillorship candidates in the Ogun Central Senatorial District for the forthcoming state Local Government election. The chairman of OGSIEC, Mr. Babatunde Osibodu, in a statement, in Abeokuta, said, “The electoral law 2007 provides that for local government elections, OGSIEC should screen all candidates and when they have been screened and accepted, then they can be given nomination forms, so the exercise is as provided for by law and the essence is to look at all the credentials presented by them. “For example, the law says a councillor must be at least 25 years old, if we discover that a candidate is below that, we will not screen that person. “Also, if a candidate is discovered to have been found guilty of committing drug offences or treason against Nigeria, or have been declared a lunatic, we are sorry, such will not be cleared based on the yardstick, such candidate will then be returned to his or her party for substitution. “It is simply so for us to have people of caliber and integrity. In total, twelve parties are participating in the primaries.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
