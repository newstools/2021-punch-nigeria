The Ondo State High Court sitting in Olokuta Correctional Centre, Akure, has granted bail to  Kemisola Ogunniyi, the #EndSARS protester who was delivered of baby in prison. Eighteen-year-old Ogunniyi and three others are standing trial for allegedly vandalising a property during the #EndSARS protest in Akure in October last year. She gave birth to a baby boy in prison last Wednesday. The defendants were charged with arson, conspiracy, riotous assembly, stealing and malicious damage. The state government had moved to secure the bail of the defendant. At the hearing of the bail application in the court on Tuesday, the judge, Justice Omolara Adejumo, granted the new mum bail. She said granted the bail based on humanitarian ground, “and for the purpose of the christening of the baby which will take place on Wednesday (today). The defendant also has a right to bail.” The judge admitted Ogunniyi to bail in the sum of N10m with one surety. The counsel for the defendant,  Mr Tope Temokun, in his reaction,  said , “She  (Ogunniyi) has been released from the prison while the bail condition would be perfected later.” He explained that the N10m bail condition did not mean that the defendant would pay the money to the court, but must have a guarantor worth N10m with evidence of tax payment, and must be residing within the jurisdiction of the court. “The whole is aware that a boy was born; and I am very sure that tomorrow (Wednesday), that boy will be named,” Temokun said. On the other defendants, Temokun said their bail application would be presented later. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
