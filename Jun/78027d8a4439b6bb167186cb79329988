The police inspector who went on a shooting spree on Sunday on 44 Golf Estate in Enugu State will face an orderly room trial, the state police command has said. Although the command refused to disclose the suspect’s name, our correspondent gathered that he hailed from Calabar, Akwa Ibom State. A spokesman for the police in Enugu State, Daniel Ndukwe, said the cop would be tried at the end of investigation. Ndukwe, when asked the name of the inspector, said, “My brother, please wait. Investigation will reveal his name. For the orderly room trial, it will be after the investigation is concluded.” Meanwhile, our correspondent, who visited the scene of the incident, gathered that most of the people killed were domestic staff of the managing director of a lotto company in Enugu. The wife of one of the victims, Mrs Oluchi Orji, told The PUNCH that the killer cop was not drunk when the incident happened. She said, “My husband was washing inside the compound when around 9am we started to hear gunshots. So, we locked our gate, thinking that it was an armed robbery. When the shooting died down, my husband went to ask the policeman what was really going on, not knowing that he was the one behind the shooting. So, immediately he saw him, he opened fire on his stomach. All efforts to save him failed.” The PUNCH had reported that the police inspector, who was attached to the Special Protection Unit, Base 9, Umuahia, Abia State, killed five people and left four others injured.
