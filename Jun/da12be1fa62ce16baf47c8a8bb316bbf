The Nigerian Business Coalition against AIDS has unveiled the first phase of the ‘I know my status’ project in Abuja, Ebonyi and Edo states. The Chief Executive Officer of NIBUCAA, Isaiah Owolabi, in a statement on Tuesday, said the project developed from the End HIV Campaign was designed and implemented to increase the knowledge of vulnerable people on their HIV status. He said, “The project is expedient to reduce the incidence of HIV in Nigeria; there is a need for continuous dissemination of sexual and reproductive health information; HIV prevention and treatment information; continuous HIV Counselling and Testing especially among adolescent and young people, women, and transport workers. This is because these populations fall within the high prevalence age bracket.” The Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Oluwatobi Ojo, in the statement, said the intervention was an eye-opener as it revealed the agitations of some people in the communities regarding HIV testing. He also stated that there was a need for increased awareness in rural areas as ‘Knowing one’s HIV status was key to societal progress.’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
