Denmark international Christian Eriksen showed no hint of any underlying health condition, Inter Milan’s team doctor said Sunday, after the midfielder’s collapse in Copenhagen. Midfielder Eriksen, 29, remained in hospital but is in a “stable” condition as he undergoes further tests after his dramatic collapse during a Euro 2020 game against Finland on Saturday. “We had a bad time, not just me, but the whole family of our club,” Piero Volpi told Gazzetta Dello Sport. “In the next few days, he will be subjected to in-depth examinations. “The important thing is that he is well, but there had never been an episode that even remotely hinted at a problem when he was at Tottenham nor at Inter. In Italy, there are very strict controls.” The Inter Milan star suddenly fell to the turf in the 43rd minute of Denmark’s opening Euro 2020 game, lying motionless as medical personnel administered CPR. He laid on the field for about 15 minutes before being carried off the pitch and rushed to the hospital. Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta said that Eriksen had sent a message on the team chat reassuring them: “I’m fine, I hope to be back soon.” “Those harsh images foreshadowed dramatic things, but luckily it wasn’t so thanks to the doctors,” said Marotta. “Thanks to everyone, opponents and friends, because they stayed close to us. He never had Covid and he has never been vaccinated, we don’t want to be intrusive because it’s right for the player to be calm. “He is a champion, we want to hold onto him for a long time and hope he can resolve these health problems.” AFP
