The number of food insecure citizens in Nigeria rose from about 25 million to 50 million due to insecurity across the country and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian Economic Summit Group has said. In a statement issued by the group in Abuja on Wednesday, the NESG stated that this was revealed at a private sector exploratory dialogue on Nigeriaâ€™s food systems. The dialogue was organised by the NESG in collaboration with the Ministry of Budget and National Planning, United Nations Nigeria and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. The statement quoted the Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Psaltry Nigeria Limited, Oluyemisi Iranloye, to have stated at the dialogue that the COVID-19 pandemic and raging insecurity had affected the agricultural industry. This, she said, had increased food insecure citizens from 25 million to 50 million. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
