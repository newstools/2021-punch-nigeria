The Adamawa State Governor, Umaru Fintiri, on Tuesday, inaugurated a 22- bed space hospital built by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in Asaba, the Delta State capital. Fintiri, who commended Okowa for his impactful leadership, noted that the specialist centre would further change the narrative of health service delivery in the state. He also called for devolution of power to ensure meaningful development in the states. “Imagine what would be done when there is devolution of power and resources to the state government. With the devolution of power, the concerns of people can be easily addressed. “At this time in Nigeria, true federalism is the solution. When you move power, resources should also be moved to the states,” he asserted. Fintiri described Okowa as a great leader within the rank of the Peoples Democratic Party, saying, “Okowa has demonstrated that he is a great leader not only in PDP but all over Nigeria.” In his address, Governor Okowa charged the Federal Government to release all funds in the National Health Act to operationalise Basic Health Care across the country. Okowa bemoaned the status of Nigeria as one of the countries with high rates of maternal and infant mortality.
