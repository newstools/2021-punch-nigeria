The police in Ekiti State said on Saturday that they had begun investigations into the killing of an operative of the Department of State Service on Friday allegedly by soldiers in a hotel in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, Sunday Abutu, said that the victim was allegedly killed during an argument with some soldiers. Abutu said, “We heard that the DSS operative was killed during a hot argument with some soldiers yesterday (Friday) evening. Our detectives have started investigation and we will get to the root of the matter”. The police spokesman said that the corpse of the deceased had been deposited in the morgue, adding, “The suspected perpetrators of the murder had been arrested”. A source alleged that one of the four soldiers in the hotel, following an argument with the DSS operative, stabbed him to death. The source said, “It was at about 7.30pm that the incident happened at a hotel along NTA Road in Ado Ekiti. The soldiers who were inside the hotel had stopped the young man they suspected to be a ‘Yahoo boy’ and while interrogating him, the young man saw the DSS operative on a bike and beckoned to him for rescue. “When the DSS got to the soldiers, a hot argument ensued between them and one of the soldiers became so angry that he drew out a knife and stabbed DSS operative in the neck. “The DSS man fell immediately and started bleeding. The people inside the hotel drinking had to run for their lives, in fact, they hurriedly fled the scene to prevent being arrested”, the source said.
