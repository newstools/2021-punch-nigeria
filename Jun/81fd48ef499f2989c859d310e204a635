The Federal Government on Tuesday said it is expecting a shipment of 3.92 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine by end of July or early August. The Executive Director, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Faisal Shuaib, disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja. He said, “We now have information that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford-Astrazeneca by end of July or early August. “As we receive additional information on the exact dates in August, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details.” Shuaib also disclosed that recent research from Public Health England had revealed that the Indian variant of the virus also known as the Delta variant B.1.617.2 is 92% susceptible to Oxford-AstraZeneca. He added, “It is therefore comforting to know that the vaccine used in Nigeria can protect against this variant that caused high morbidity and mortality in India. “However, it underscores the need for us to ramp up our vaccination to more Nigerians.”
