THE Bayelsa State Livestock Management Committee has impounded 34 cows for allegedly flouting the law banning open grazing of cows in the state. The Chairman of the committee and Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr David Alagoa, said the cows were seized on Monday around the Bayelsa Palm area of Yenagoa, the state capital. Governor Douye Diri signed into law the Livestock Breeding and Marketing Regulation Bill, 2021 in March after the passage by the House of Assembly. Diri had stated among others that “by assenting to the law, any person found engaging in open grazing of livestock on foot commits an offence and would be arrested and prosecuted with the livestock impounded.” Alagoa said the herders chose a convenient period of the night to engage in grazing of their cows. The commissioner said, “There is also movement by trekking around the Bayelsa Palm to the Swali Slaughter. That tends to happen at about 1am in the morning. So, they chose a convenient time to graze when there is nobody around. “We have been monitoring their movements and we decided to surprise them on Monday. We were able to impound 34 cows last night; we are going to follow the law. The law states that we impound and there is also a fee to be paid for trespass.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
