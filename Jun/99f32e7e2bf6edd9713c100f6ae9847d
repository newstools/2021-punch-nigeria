The Lagos State Pension Commission has urged prospective retirees in the state public civil service to ensure they begin documentation six months to their retirement. The commission said this during the 20th pre-retirement documentation seminar in Lagos, according to a statement on Friday. The seminar, which was held virtually, enlightened the workers who were about to retire and touched on different topics that cut across health, finances and life after retirement. During the ceremony, the Commissioner for Establishments, Training, and Pensions, Mrs Ajibola Ponnle, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Civil Service Pension Office, Mr Oluwole Onasanya, congratulated the would-be retirees for the preparation for their disengagement from the service after serving the state. He also commended the LASPEC team for ensuring that Lagos State remained the only state where pension administration was working effectively. He praised the achievements of the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for his achievement in ensuring the labour of civil servants in Lagos State was not in vain. The commissioner said the governor was committed to the welfare of the workforce and pensioners in the state. In his welcome address, the Director-General, LASPEC, Mr Babalola Obilana, said retirement benefit documentation seminar was organised to guide and ensure a smooth exit from active service. He said having spent a significant amount of productive years working for the state government, it was imperative that transition to retirement should be stress-free. He said the Lagos State Government was passionate about the welfare of its workforce, present and post-service. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
