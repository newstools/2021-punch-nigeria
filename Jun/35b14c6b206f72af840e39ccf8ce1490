The police in Rivers State have said Governor Nyesom Wike’s decision to impose curfew and border restriction has assisted in reducing the spate of killings and attacks on policemen. The spokesman for the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, said this on the telephone on Monday. Recall that Wike had imposed the curfew from 8.30pm to 6am daily in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor local government areas, while the restriction took effect from 7pm to 6am in the other 21LGA’s of the state. Omoni said the restriction “has reduced the rate of crime generally in the state,” adding that the command would want the governor to extend it. He said, “The curfew has assisted us (police) in reducing the spate of killings and attacks on the police and crime in general in the state. “We cannot wait for its extension until we are able to deal effectively with the criminal elements.” Asked how many persons have been arrested for criminal offences and those who flouted the curfew time, Omoni said he could not immediately give a figure, but the police had tracked down suspected criminals. “You know their movements have been restricted. So we are now smoking them out from their hideouts and dens. They now have short time to operate,” he stated. Omoni, a Superintendent of Police, said a numbers of suspects arrested for various crimes were in custody, saying, “Soon, they will be paraded and members of the press will be invited.” Copyright PUNCH.
