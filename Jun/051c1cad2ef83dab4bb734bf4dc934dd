Passengers travelling from Kaduna to Abuja on the Nigerian Railway Corporation’s train service on Monday were left stranded in Dutse, Kaduna, after the train conveying them broke down due to mechanical failure. Officials of the NRC at the Abuja/Kaduna Station confirmed that the train developed mechanical issues some minutes into the two and half hours journey. It was gathered that the train took off from the Rigasa Station in Kaduna and stopped twice on the way before getting to Dutse where it eventually packed up. Although operators of the service claimed that they sent a rescue locomotive to quickly pick the travellers, some passengers alleged that they spent about three hours before they were moved out of the area. “I rushed to the terminal to join the 6.40am train on Monday and after the train left the Rigasa Station and moved for only few minutes it stopped,” a passenger who simply gave his name as Haruna, said. He added, “I don’t think the train had moved for up to 10 minutes before it eventually packed up around Dutse in Kaduna. And this happened after it had stopped twice. I suspect that those stops were also due to faults.” The breakdown was further confirmed by the Abuja/Kaduna Train Service Station Manager, Paschal Nnorli, who stated that the train packed up due to mechanical failure. He told our correspondent that the NRC had to send another locomotive to go as a rescue facility, adding that the faulty locomotive was being fixed. “It is true that our first train service this morning broke down in Kaduna but it was due to a mechanical failure that happens to machines generally,” he said. Nnorli added, “However, the important thing is our ability to respond and come to the rescue. We sent a rescue locomotive and as at about 10am I was told that the locomotive had arrived at the location.” The station manager said the passengers were eventually conveyed by the rescue locomotive and expressed regret for the inconveniences caused by the development.
