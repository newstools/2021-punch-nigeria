THE Court of Appeal sitting in Akure, has fixed Wednesday June 16, 2021, for judgement on the appeal filed by the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, in the October 20, 2020 Governorship Election, Mr Eyitayo Jegede. Jegede, who lost the governorship poll to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, had challenged his electoral defeat before the Election Tribunal, saying the process which produced Akeredolu as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, was illegal, among other grounds. The tribunal however dismissed his petition for lack of merit. Thereafter Jegede proceeded to the appellate court to challenge the tribunal judgement. It was gathered that after the counsels of the appellant and the defendants had addressed the court, the appellate court reserved its judgement a few days ago. The State PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kennedy Peretei, who confirmed the development, said, “The Appeal Court has communicated to us since Friday that the judgement would come up on Wednesday.” Copyright PUNCH.
