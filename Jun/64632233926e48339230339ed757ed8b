Pandemonium broke out in Ilaro Yewa-South Local Government Area of Ogun State as angry mob set ablaze a truck laden with cement belonging to the Dangote Cement Company after crushing a secondary school pupil to death. The Spokesman for the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. Akinbiyi said the mob also vandalised the truck of the fire service which moved to the scene to put out the fire. The TRACE spokesperson added that the incident occurred on Friday after the pupils closed from the school at Sabo Junction in Ilaro. Akinbiyi attributed the incident to loss of control due to speeding, noting that the truck was burnt beyond recognition. He said “The presumed dead victim has been deposited at the mortuary in Ilaro General Hospital. Traffic was affected because pupils trooped in a large number to set the truck on fire.’’ He also stated that the mob prevented fire fighters from extinguishing the fire leading to the destruction of their truck.
