THE Vice Chairman of the Delta State chapter of the All Progressive Congress, Chief George Okafor, has said peace will continue to elude the party even after the 2023 general elections. He said this while leading over 5,000 APC members who dumped the party in order to join the ruling People’s Democratic Party, in Asaba, on Thursday. Okafor, described the APC as a “battlefield without hope for respite in sight.” Okafor said, “I have tendered my resignation from the position of Chairman, APC Delta North Caretaker Committee effective from Wednesday, June 22, 2021; and by this notice, I also want to denounce my membership of the APC henceforth. “My decision to quit the party is borne from inner convictions that Delta APC has remained an unending battlefield without hope for respite. While expressing gratitude to the APC for providing him a temporary shelter, he said, “My return to the PDP after a sabbatical seven years in the opposition party, I would say, is an act of divine intervention. “While on my sojourn, I rose to the position of Chairman, APC Delta North, which position I resigned effective yesterday, Wednesday, June 22, 2021, to return fully to my original family and home, the PDP. “In Delta APC, things will continue to fall apart, I do not see them coming together even beyond 2023” The over 5000 APC members from Delta North in Aniocha and Oshimili Federal Constituency, were received into the PDP by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, with a promise to accord them full recognition.
