The police council may on Thursday (today) confirm Mr Usman Baba as the substantive Inspector-General of Police, The PUNCH has learnt. The confirmation may be one of the highlights of a meeting of the council to be presided over by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Security challenges across the country and how best to tackle them are also expected to be discussed at the meeting. The meeting, which was earlier slated for last Thursday, was postponed by one week in honour of the late former Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 others, who died in an air crash in Kaduna penultimate Friday. The council, which has the President as chairman, and all state governors as well as the chairman of the Police Service Commission as members, as part of its constitutional functions, confirms the appointments of IGs. Recall that Buhari had on April 6 appointed Baba as the IG in acting capacity pending confirmation by the council, taking over from Mohammed Adamu. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
