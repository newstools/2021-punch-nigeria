The Zamfara State Police Command has repelled an attack on a Fulani settlement in the Anka Local Government Area of the state. In a statement, the Public Relations Officer of the command, SP Mohammed Shehu, said suspected bandits stormed the settlement on the outskirts of Anka town, on Wednesday. The statement read, “On June 2, 2021 around 5pm, police tactical operatives deployed in Anka LGA were alerted that armed bandits in their hundreds stormed a Fulani settlement located on the outskirts of Anka with the intent to attack and rustle cows belonging to the Fulani settlers. “A combined police team, in collaboration with the military, mobilised to the scene, where they engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel. “As a result, they scampered to the forest and escaped with possible gunshot wounds. “All the rustled cows were recovered for the Fulani communities. “A rigorous confidence-building patrol is being sustained to avert any attempt by the bandits to regroup for another onslaught.” The state Commissioner of Police, CP Hussaini Rabiu, commended the joint security operatives for their resilience and urged them to sustain the tempo until lasting peace was restored in the state.
