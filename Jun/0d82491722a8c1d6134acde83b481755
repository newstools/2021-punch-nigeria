A fresh crisis may be brewing in the Peoples Democratic Party as the Concerned PDP League, also known as ‘PDP Watchdog’, demanded the resignation of the party’s Chairman, Board of Trustees, Walid Jibrin; National Chairman, Uche Secondus; Financial Secretary, Abdullahi Maibasira, and other members of the National Working Committee. The organisation said the demand became necessary following the failure of the PDP leaders to provide strong opposition leadership that the PDP patriots and Nigerians were yearning to salvage Nigeria from the brinks of political, economic, and social collapse. The leader of the Concerned PDP League, Daboikiabo Warmate, who read the demands during a press conference in Abuja, challenged the party’s leadership to give Nigerians people-oriented strong opposition. He also called on the Senate to reject the nomination of Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission. According to him, the PDP helmsmen should lead a one-million man protest against the daily killings, hunger, increase in food price, insecurity, delay in the passage and signing of the electoral bill into law. Warmate also demanded that the PDP leaders must stand by the Niger State congress appeal panel reports and conduct a free and fair congress on or before June 30, 2021, and uphold the suspension of former Governor of the State, Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu. He said, “The National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, and his team were unable to galvanise and harmonise the plethora of individuals, groups and regional interests, and this has led to a series of decamping, court cases and crises in some states and local government area chapters. “The board of trustees chairman, with his actions and inaction, has done little or nothing in calling the national chairman to order and also boosting the morale of millions of members and Nigerians at large just as the national chairman has not lived up to his responsibility.” He said the nomination of Onochie was “inconsistent with any and every electoral law in Nigeria, most especially Section 153 Subsection 3 and item F, Paragraph 14(2)(c) of the Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.”
