The acting Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko, has said the authority was committed to resolving all the challenges hindering the smooth implementation of the electronic call-up system. Bello-Koko said this on Tuesday while interacting with truck owners and drivers during his visit to the Lilipond Terminal in Ijora for a firsthand assessment of the information technology infrastructure built in the terminal for the call-up system. He said the visit was to enable him to re-evaluate the performance of the truck call-up system, three months after it was deployed, and also engage directly with the service users. “We will ensure that the entire process is fully automated and secured to prevent counterfeiting, while priority will be given to export cargoes in line with the economic diversification agenda of the Federal Government,” Bello-Koko said. The President of the Association of Maritime Truck Owners, Chief Remi Ogungbemi, who spoke on behalf of haulage operators at the port, said he was delighted with the unannounced visit of the NPA boss. He described the visit as a demonstration of the acting MD’s appreciation that the truck call-up system is a priority. The NPA had on February 27 rolled out an electronic call-up system for trucks in a bid to address the intractable traffic along the access roads leading to the two major seaports in the Lagos area.
