Former Golden Eaglets goalkeeper Daniel Jinadu has signed a one-year deal with English Championship club, Barnsley, following his release by West Ham United, Sunday PUNCH reports. The 18-year-old keeper, who made three appearances for Nigeria at the 2019 U-17 World Cup in Brazil, joins The Tykes following a successful trial. “I’m absolutely delighted to have signed,” Jinadu told the club’s website. “Just to be at such a great club and have the opportunity to continue my career and take the next stage of my career, be at this club and do that. “Being behind the likes of great goalkeepers like Brad Collins and Jack Walton, being here and being able to learn from them and experience them is just amazing, so I’m really happy to be here.” Jinadu will link up with Barnsley’s U-23 side for the 2021/22 Professional Development League campaign, while also providing competition for the first team.
