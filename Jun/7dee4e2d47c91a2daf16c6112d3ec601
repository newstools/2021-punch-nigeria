One Emmanuel Obinyan has been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for allegedly obtaining by false pretences and diverting the sum of N77,773,700. It was gathered that one late Daniel Chinemelum, sometime in July 2015, entered into a partnership agreement and also signed a memorandum of understanding with Obinyan for the formation of a real estate company, Fedan Courtyard Home Services Limited. According to the complainants, who are the children of Daniel, Stephen and Emeka Chinemelum, their father paid the sum of N52m into the suspect’s Zenith Bank account number 1011861572 as equity contribution to the business. The complainants further alleged that the suspect, however, failed to render an account of the business at the expiration of the five-year duration of the agreement. The Head of Media and Publicity, EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, said the failure of the complainants to retrieve the money from Obinyan prompted them to report to the commission. Similarly, the commission has also arrested one Rasaki Adeyiga over an alleged N24,260,000 fraud. It was gathered that Adeyiga allegedly presented himself to the complainant, Ahmed Shinkafi, as a businessman dealing in the importation of automobiles from the United States of America and Europe. The complainant allegedly paid the sum of N25m for a Lexus SUV into the suspect’s account number 0136968208 domiciled in Guaranty Trust Bank Plc. However, the suspect reneged on his promise and diverted the money to his personal use. According to Uwujaren, the suspects would soon be charged. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
