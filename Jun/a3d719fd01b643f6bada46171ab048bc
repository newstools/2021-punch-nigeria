Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has defied the ban placed on the microblogging site, Twitter, in Nigeria, by tweeting via his official handle. In a tweet on Tuesday evening, Ortom condemned the suspension of the site by FG, calling it “illegal”. The tweet reads, “The ban on Twitter is not only illegal but it is also an ill-advised move to divert the attention of Nigerians from the FG’s failure to tackle insecurity in parts of the country. “It amounts to suppression of fundamental human rights and gagging of social media”. Recall that the Federal Government had on Friday last week suspended the operations of Twitter for allegedly promoting contents capable of “threatening the corporate existence of Nigerians.” However, Nigerians have continued to access the social media platform in the country via the use of Virtual Private Networks.
