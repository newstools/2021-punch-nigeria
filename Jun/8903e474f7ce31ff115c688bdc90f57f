The Sokoto State Commissioner for Finance, Abdussamad Dasuki, said he was not interested in contesting for the state gubernatorial position in 2023. Dasuki stated this on Monday on a radio station, where he spoke on the achievements of the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal, as part of activities marking Democracy Day. The commissioner, while responding to the question on whether he would contest in the state gubernatorial election in 2023, stated that he should be counted out of the race. He said, “I am not in the race. Please count me out of the 2023 governorship contest. I am privileged to be given an important assignment as a commissioner by Governor Tambuwal to reposition the state’s finance and ensure its judicious application for the benefit of the people of Sokoto. I am focused on that assignment and will not be distracted by 2023 politics.” Dasuki, who noted that his ministry was saddled with the task of guarding the state treasury and working towards ensuring Sokoto State was financially healthy and prosperous, said the state governor had strengthened the economy of the state, sanitized the payroll system, plugged loopholes and repositioned the state finances.
