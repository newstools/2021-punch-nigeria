Popular actress, comedian and broadcaster, Omotunde Adebowale-David, aka Lolo, has advised fellow entertainers to cultivate a saving culture, and invest in real estate. According to her, that would save them from having to develop on anybody for their needs. Speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony by a real estate company, Gtext Homes, at Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, Lolo said, “It is very important for entertainers to save for the rainy day. One would not always be at the top of one’s career, so when one is making money, one should remember to save for the future. Beyond that, they should also invest in real estate because property usually appreciates in value over time. “There are a lot of real estate companies out there, so every time I look at a company, I look at its pedigree? If I see progression, I can rest assured that they have a plan for the future. Gone are those days when people are comfortable with the normal. This company is all about green and smart homes. People want to see extra.” Actress, Bimpe Akintunde, also advised people to have multiple streams of income. She said, “I would advise everybody, not just entertainers, to have multiple streams of income. With Gtext Homes, one can be sure that one is dealing with a reputable company.” Copyright PUNCH.
