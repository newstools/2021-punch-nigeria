The All Progressives Congress party has still yet to release the results of the local government primaries for councillorship and chairmanship slots in the forthcoming council election. The APC, at its secretariat in Acme road, Ikeja, on Tuesday, posted a notice on its gate asking aspirants who wished to file petitions to the appeal committee to do so latest June 2, 2021. However, a source told our correspondent that nobody was sure of when the result would be released by the party due to the controversy surrounding the elections. He said, “The result is not yet out, so many aspirants don’t know their fates. Those their fates are known are the consensus candidates.” Another source told our correspondent that there were reports that some aspirants had been given nomination forms by the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission. “I saw a picture of an aspirant with a nomination form. I don’t know if he is a consensus or not. If not, how did he get the form when the results are not out? You understand. “No one knows when the result will be released. They have till Friday to make their final submission to LASIEC,” he added. The APC spokesperson, Mr Seye Oladejo, did not issue any statement on Tuesday. Also, all calls to his mobile phone rang out. The Secretary for LASIEC, Mr Tope Ojo, could not be reached for comment. ”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
