THREE suspected gun dealers have been killed by troops operating around Sabo Birni border town of Sokoto State. The troops also recovered RPG bombs and RPG chargers, machine gun, AK-47 rifle and other accessories from the neutralised gunrunners. This was disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday by the Director Army Public Relations, Mohammed Yerima. Yerima said the troop acted following credible information about gunrunners moving weapons on foot from Niger Republic into Nigeria around 11pm. The statement was titled, ‘NA troops neutralise three gunrunners, recovered weapons in Sokoto border town.’ It read, “The highly vigilant troops mounted a successful ambush along the suspected route close to Garin Naimaimai village and neutralised the three gunrunners. “The Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, commended the efforts of the troops and urged them to sustain the operation in dominating all the illegal routes around the border areas with Niger Republic to frustrate any movement of weapons and ammunition into the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
