Premier League clubs Arsenal and Newcastle are among the clubs interested in making a bid for Fulham defender of Nigerian descent Tosin Adarabioyo, The PUNCH reports. Adarabioyo, who was one of the Cottagers’ best performers in the Premier League last season, can leave Craven Cottage for just £10m this summer, thanks to a release clause in his deal. According to Sportsmail, the clause expires 30 days before the Championship season, which is scheduled to start on August 7. Adarabioyo recorded the most clearances in Premier League (193) and the fastest sprint time by any central defender last season. The 23-year-old made 24 appearances for Fulham last season.
