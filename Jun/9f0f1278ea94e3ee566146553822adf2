Social media platform, Crowwe, has applied for a licence from the National Broadcasting Commission in line with the Federal Government’s new drive to register all social media platforms in the country, The PUNCH has been informed. This is just as the number of users has risen to 31,245. The Chief Executive Officer of IPI, Mr. Adamu Garba, who created the social media app, said this during a chat with our correspondent on Thursday. Garba said the Crowe app which was taken down by Google app store on Saturday, would return in a matter of days. He added, “Crowwe now has 31,245 users with about 2, 270 business accounts. We have written a letter to the NBC applying for a licence in line with the Federal Government’s announcement but we have not yet received any response. If they don’t respond by Friday, we will send a second letter.” On when Crowwe would return to the Google app store, Garba said, “There are some lapses. It consumes a lot of data based on user complaints so we decided to take up some opportunities to do that. We have edited. We will upload it by Saturday or so.” Garba, who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, also stated that his Instagram page which was suspended some days ago had been restored. He said it was brought down because several people reported his page because they didn’t like him. “So many people reported my Instagram page. It was disabled but it has been restored,” he said.
