FORMER Interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Bisi Akande, has urged members of the Osun State chapter of the party to work towards improving the party’s fortune in order to secure another term for Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Akande, made the appeal in his country home in Ila, Osun State, when he received members of a group, ‘Opomulero Osun, on Sunday.’ This was contained in a statement by a former Osun state Commissioner for Information, Sunday Akere, who is the secretary of the group. It reads in part, “In his response, Chief Akande enjoined all the members to rise up and support the ongoing move to embrace new members that want to join the party and also work on improving the fortunes of the party in the forthcoming election to secure a second term for Governor Gboyega Oyetola and continuity of progressive ideals in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
