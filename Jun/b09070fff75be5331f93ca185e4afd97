Former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has said social media platforms should deactivate the accounts associated with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and his government. Fayose said this following the Federal Government’s suspension of Twitter’s operation in Nigeria. The Ministry of Information and Culture which made the announcement cited the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.” With Twitter still active as of the time of filing this report, Fayose took to the platform to air his displeasure at the Federal Government’s decision. “Those undermining the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression should themselves not enjoy such right. “Therefore, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms should deactivate all accounts associated with @MBuhari and his government t as done in Turkey in 2020 for us to have peace in Nigeria,” he wrote.
