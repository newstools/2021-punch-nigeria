The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Wednesday fixed July 2, 2021, for the parties to adopt their processes in the suit filed by a former governor of Abia State and Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, asking the court to stop his retrial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Justice Inyang Ekwo, after listening to the submissions of the counsels on both sides, adjourned till July 2 for adoption of the processes. The EFCC’s lawyer, Oluwaleke Atolagbe; counsel for Udeh Jones, George Ukaegbu; and counsel for Slok Nigeria Limited, K. C. Nwafor, informed the court that they have filed and exchanged processes. Kalu’s lawyer, Prof. Awa Kalu SAN, also informed the court that he has been served with the respondents’ counter-affidavit. The court, therefore, adjourned the matter. Kalu had earlier approached the court to stop the EFCC from retrying him in the alleged money laundering charge that was preferred against him. He asserted that a retrial of the suit against him will amount to double jeopardy as he had been tried, convicted, and sentenced on the same charge. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
