The president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has said that those sponsoring terrorism in the country are people who have been made irrelevant and are only trying to register their presence through violence. He said this on Friday during an exclusive interview with the Nigerian Television Authority. Buhari said, “Their motive is that, since they have been made irrelevant, they want to use the resources they have accumulated over the years to prove that they are still around. “The administration will deal with them, anybody caught will be dealt with.” Details soon
