THERE was tension at Ashaka in Ndokwa East Local Government Area of Delta State as over 20 gunmen on Sunday attacked a police station in the community with suspected improvised explosive devices. The PUNCH gathered that the gunmen, who were later repelled by the police operatives, however, burnt down the station. Though no life was lost in the attack, the operational vehicles of the command were set ablaze by the hoodlums. Confirming the incident, the Command’s spokesman in the state, Bright Edafe, said the attack took place at about 1am. He said, “Some enemies of the community and the police; all armed men numbering about 20, stormed Ashaka Police Station. “They threw IEDs at the station, shot sporadically, set the police station that was built by the community/DESOPADEC ablaze, and also burnt down patrol vehicles bought for the police division by the good people of the community just to ensure that police presence is not felt.” In another development, police joint team on Friday killed six suspected armed robbers/kidnappers during a serious gunfight. According the PPRO, the joint team in the process killed six of them, while others fled with gunshot injuries into the bush, one AK-47 rifle, one Pump Action gun and one AK-47 magazine with 25 live ammunition were recovered.
