The Bishop of Ijesha North Anglican Diocese, Rev. Isaac Oluyamo, has expressed fears that the cost of votes could rise to N50,000 per vote if the menace of vote-buying was not checked. He enjoined the politicians and the Independent National Electoral Commission to take steps to end the ugly trade for the right leaders to emerge during elections. Oluyamo spoke while delivering a sermon at the Fourth Synod of Ijesa North Diocese of the Anglican Communion, held at St. Peter’s Anglican Church, Erinmo-Ijesha, Osun State, on Saturday. He said, “Osun State will again be going into the gubernatorial election next year. We advise all our politicians to sheath their swords and let peace reign. Elections cannot be held in the absence of peace. “They should also desist from vote-buying which is rampant now in every election in Nigeria. We are aware of a state where elections took place recently. There were reports of voting buying, where the electorate sold votes for between N20,000 and N25,000 each. “If this continues, it means in future elections, votes would be sold for N50,000. We urge the Independent National Electoral Commission to be faithful, straightforward and be independent indeed as their name implies.” He appealed to the Federal Government to improve the security of INEC offices across the state just as he urged them to end the menace of vote-buying. Commenting on the agitation for an independent Yoruba nation, Oluyamo, who pledged support for the agitators, rejected a nation where terrorists were celebrated, while agitators were being killed.
