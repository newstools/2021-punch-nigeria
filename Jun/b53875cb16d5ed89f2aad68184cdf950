THE Federal Government has declared the National Taskforce on the Prohibition of Illegal Importation/Smuggling of Arms, Ammunition, Light Weapons, Chemical Weapons and Pipeline Vandalism an illegal security outfit. It therefore directed NATFORCE and other such groups to immediately end their operations nationwide. The National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.), gave the directive in a statement on Sunday. NATFORCE had last week Monday said it received Israeli experts that would train its management staff and operatives. It said the Israelis from “world-renowned international security trainer organisation, ETOS Company, arrived at NATFORCE head office penultimate Thursday. But the Head, Strategic Communication, Office of the National Security Adviser, Z.M. Usman, disclosed the NSA’s position on the group in a statement titled ‘Office of the National Security Adviser directs the dismantling of illegal security outfits’. He said the NSA had directed the immediate dismantling of all illegal security outfits and warned against the use of such outfits to extort, harass and intimidate Nigerians. The statement read in part, “The Office of the National Security Adviser has observed with concern the proliferation of illegal security outfits in the country.” “The NSA accused these illegal outfits of extorting, harassing and intimidating Nigerians while masquerading as part of the Nigerian security architecture. “One of such groups is NATFORCE which seeks to combat illegal importation of arms, ammunition, light weapons, chemical weapons and pipeline vandalism and has been involved in mounting illegal roadblocks, conducting illegal searches, seizures and recruitment.” Copyright PUNCH.
