He said, “Let me say it again, you are the only one licenced to carry guns in our country. Don’t allow yourself to be killed by idiots who do not have the authority of the law to carry guns. Stop allowing yourselves to be murdered in cold blood by them. Defend yourselves, the lives and property of peace-loving people of the state.” The governor also disclosed that his administration was putting a programme together where all the family members of those who died during the unrest in the state would be compensated. Assuring that the state government would improve the security situation of the state, Uzodinma, pledged to increase the logistics the police required to police the state.
