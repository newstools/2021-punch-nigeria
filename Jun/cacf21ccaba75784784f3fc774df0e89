The Edo State Police Command said it had begun the streamlining of the activities of vigilance groups in the state due to complaints received from members of the public. Speaking on a local radio station monitored in Benin City, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Kontongs Bello, said the police would soon begin “training of the vigilantes at the police training school,” which he said, the state government was renovating to make it conducive. He said the Assistant Inspector-General of Police had directed that all vigilantes be profiled by the Divisional Police Officers in their areas. Bello said, “We are streamlining their activities to regulate them due to complaints received from members of the public. “We have directed their leaders to take their members to the nearest Divisional Police Officers for registration and profiling, to ensure that those involved are not cultists and robbers who want to use the opportunity to bring out their guns and molest innocent people; we are not going to allow that. “We are calling on people with genuine intentions to join the vigilance groups and work with us. We do not want those who are molesting and robbing people with guns and hiding under the guise of being vigilantes. The essence of creating a vigilance group is for them to work with the police, while the police will supervise their activities.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
