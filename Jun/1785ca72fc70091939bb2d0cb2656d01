The word ‘grease’ comes from the Latin word ‘crassus’ which means ‘fat,’ which effectively describes its consistency. It is believed that around 500 BC the ancient Egyptians were among the first to develop real grease by combining olive oil with lime (calcium), which acted as a thickening agent. The purpose of grease lubrication Lubricating grease is a semi-fluid to solid lubricant containing a thickening agent and additives.  There are three core principles of grease lubrication: the grease works its way into the cavities around a bearing; the thickener holds the oil in the lubricating zone; and the grease shears, delivering a slow release of oil into the path of the rolling elements. The purpose of grease in industrial applications is to lubricate moving parts while retaining its performance properties under extreme temperatures and pressures. Industrial applications where grease may be used include roller bearings, open gears, enclosed gears, centralised systems, wire ropes, slides and seals. In most applications, the original manufacturer will recommend grease or oil for its machinery. If a bearing needs both cooling and cleaning, oil may be recommended. However, if the location is difficult to access and cooling is not needed, grease can be used. Grease keeps the mechanic away From the point of application to the type of grease you use, the following habits can keep equipment running longer and more consistently — no matter your workload. Fleet owners across Nigeria should know that regular vehicle maintenance is vital to keeping their operation running smoothly. While checking the oil, filters and odometer is usually top-of-mind, the importance of grease is often overlooked. From the point of application to the type of grease you’re using, the following habits can keep equipment running longer and more consistently— no matter your workload. Switch grease seasonally We should use grease designed to withstand hotter temperatures. If operators use NLGI No. 1 grade grease during colder months, it’s likely time to switch to NLGI No. 2 grade grease in advance of warmer weather. You can have the same chemistry and the same lubrication properties in a No. 1 and a No. 2. The only difference is that a No. 1 is less dense, so it flows easier in cold weather. Lower density makes No. 1 grease ideal for cool temperatures because it’s less likely to stiffen. However, this increased viscosity means that higher temperatures can leave it thinner and unable to provide proper protection. Insufficient lubrication leads to excessive friction, which spells eventual breakdown. Generally, No. 2 grease should be used in hotter and rainy seasons. Know the equipment’s grease points and which type of grease each requires Grease isn’t just for the yoke on the fifth wheel or the axle. It’s important to understand that not all grease points take the same lubrication. There are at least five or six additional grease points between the axle, steering and the truck or tractor itself. And the grease you put on the fifth wheel, with all that sliding contact and high-force pressure, is different from the type of grease needed for bearings. Multi-purpose products can be especially tempting; however, there are few products that can truly serve both sliding equipment components and bearings. For instance, sliding components like an axle do better with grease that contains molybdenum disulfide, or “moly,” like Cenex Maxtron EP. On the other hand, bearings need additional protection against water washout and will perform better with a polyurea-based product, like Cenex Poly-Xtreme. Understanding what grease needs to do and why quality matters Each component of your equipment faces unique demands, meaning different products may be required to maintain equipment efficiency during long haul duty cycles. An over-the-road truck may need multiple greases applied weekly due to the miles accumulated over long days of continuous operation. Owners and operators need quality products that they can depend on, whether that’s providing lubrication during extreme weather or enduring an intensive work cycle. There’s nothing to gain by taking shortcuts on cheap grease. When using premium synthetics or synthetic blends, or anytime a grease has ‘complex’ in its name, it’s good to understand that there is a higher degree of thickener and technology being used, so it’s going to cost a little bit more. Grease only accounts for about one to two per cent of total fleet operation costs, but it can extend the life of equipment for years. While it seems like an afterthought, a grease programme isn’t the place to skimp. Modern synthetic lubricants, which can seem like a larger upfront investment, generally come with technology for better dual-phase lubrication. Both the oil and the thickener in the formula provide lubrication, but they do so differently. The difference is important for how a product performs in machinery and reinforces the need for both ingredients to be high-quality. People tend to think all greases are the same, but nothing could be further from the truth. Grease has a ton of technology in it. And using specialised products will provide the best lubrication for your equipment. A holistic maintenance schedule for any fleet should include a thorough lubrication programme. Consistently applying the most effective grease to the right moving parts can extend the life of your fleet and decrease equipment downtime due to improper maintenance. To find the best grease for your rigs and equipment, reference your vehicle’s owner’s manual. P1146: Heated oxygen sensor 2 minimum voltage monitoring bank 1
Meaning
The heated oxygen sensor 2 (HO2S) (Rear O2 Sensor), after a three way catalyst (manifold), monitors the oxygen level in the exhaust gas on each bank. For optimum catalyst operation, the air fuel mixture (air-fuel ratio) must be maintained near the ideal stoichiometric ratio. The HO2S output voltage changes suddenly in the vicinity of the stoichiometric ratio. The engine control module adjusts the fuel injection time so that the air-fuel ratio is nearly stoichiometric. The HO2S generates a voltage between 0.1 and 0.9 V in response to oxygen in the exhaust gas. If the oxygen in the exhaust gas increases, the air-fuel ratio becomes Lean. The ECM interprets lean when the HO2S voltage is below 0.45 V. If the oxygen in the exhaust gas decreases, the air-fuel ratio becomes rich. The ECM interprets rich when the HO2S voltage is above 0.45 V.

P1148: Closed loop control function bank 1
Meaning
The engine control module performs on/off duty control of the air fuel ratio /heated oxygen sensor 1 heater corresponding to the engine operating condition to keep the temperature of air fuel ratio/heated oxygen sensor 1 element at the specified range.
Possible causes
Faulty heated oxygen sensor 1 bank 1

P1149: Air/fuel ratio sensor 1 circuit range/performance
Meaning
The air/fuel ratio sensor 1 is installed in the exhaust system and detects oxygen content in the exhaust gas. The A/F sensor transmits output voltage to the engine control module /powertrain control module. A heater for the sensor element is embedded in the A/F sensor (sensor 1). It is activated and heats the sensor to stabilise and speed the detection of oxygen content by controlling current flowing through the heater. An increase in the current levels off as the applied voltage to the element electrode reaches a certain range because the amount of oxygen which is led through the diffusion layer is limited. The current amperage is proportional to oxygen content in the exhaust gas, so the air/fuel ratio is detected by the measurement of the current amperage. The ECM/PCM compares a set target air/fuel ratio with the detected air/fuel ratio and controls the fuel injection timing.
If the A/F sensor (sensor 1) voltage is low, the air/fuel ratio is lean, and the ECM/PCM uses A/F feedback control to issue a rich command. If the A/F sensor (sensor 1) voltage is high, the air/fuel ratio is rich, and the ECM/PCM uses A/F feedback control to issue a lean command.
If the element is not activated or the ECM/PCM terminal voltage is a set value or less for at least a set time period when the power is drawn to the A/F sensor (sensor 1) heater, a malfunction is detected and a DTC is stored.
Possible causes
Faulty air/fuel ratio sensor 1
Air/fuel ratio sensor 1 harness is open or shorted
Air/fuel ratio sensor 1 circuit poor electrical connection
P1150: Air/fuel ratio sensor circuit range/performance malfunction bank 2 sensor 1
Meaning
The air-fuel ratio (A/F) sensor varies its output voltage in proportion to the air-fuel ratio. Based on the output voltage, the engine control module determines if the air-fuel ratio is RICH or LEAN and adjusts the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. The ECM also checks the fuel injection volume compensation value to check if the A/F sensor is deteriorating or not. A/F sensor response deterioration is determined by the ratio of the A/F sensor output voltage variation and fuel trim variation.
Possible causes
Faulty air fuel ratio (A/F) bank 2 sensor 1
Air fuel ratio (A/F) bank 2 Sensor 1 harness is open or shorted
Air fuel ratio (A/F) bank 2 Sensor 1 circuit poor electrical connection
