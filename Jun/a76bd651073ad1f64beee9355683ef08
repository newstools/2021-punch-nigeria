Scores of aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State on Saturday protested against the choice of a chairmanship candidate from Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state over certificate forgery allegations. The protesters, armed with placards with various inscriptions, stormed the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Oke-Ilewo, Abeokuta, and faulted the choice of Adeshina Ogunshola as candidate in the forthcoming LG elections. They alleged that Ogunshola’s claim that he bagged a Bachelor of Art degree in Philosophy from the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State was untrue. Addressing newsmen during the protest, one of the aggrieved aspirants, Odunkunle Babajide, alleged that their findings had shown that the candidate did not graduate from the school. He said, “He presented a notification of result to that effect. The university had since, on more than one occasion, said that the said notification of result did not emanate from them.” Reacting to the allegation, Ogunshola said they were baseless, unfounded and should be disregarded in their entirety. He said, “The allegation of forgery and perjury levelled against me by the aspirants has been sufficiently addressed by the party leadership which refuted same and absolved me of any misdemeanour. “The attempt by these aggrieved aspirants to disparage notable and highly respected leaders and functionaries of the Governor Dapo Abiodun-led administration under the guise of protesting the Chairmanship selection process is unwarranted and uncalled for”.
