HAJIA Asia El-Rufai, wife of Kaduna State Governor, says no ransom should be paid to her abductors in case she is kidnapped by bandits. She also said Nigerians must sacrifice to end banditry and kidnapping currently ravaging the North-West geopolitical zone of the country. El-Rufai’s wife stated this in Kaduna on Wednesday at a peace and security workshop for Kaduna women organised by Equal Access International. The women were drawn from Chikun, Kajuru and Jema’a local government areas of the state. She charged them to shun divisive narratives created by selfish politicians and work for the unity of the state. While arguing against the payment of ransom to bandits, Mrs. El-Rufai noted that she would prefer to die in the hands of her abductors if that would usher in peace in the country. According to her, paying ransom to bandits is like adding kerosene to fire. She said, “For as long as you continue to pay ransom, it is like you are adding kerosene to fire, you are giving bandits, kidnappers money for ammunition to continue to haunt you. We should not pay ransom.” Earlier, the EAI’s Country Director, Mr. Maaji Peters, said the training was aimed at securing Nigerian communities through the creation of civilian security, who would make contributions and decisions on issues affecting them and their communities.
