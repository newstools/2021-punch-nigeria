Shehu Gusau and Tonobok Okowa have emerged as presidents of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria in separate elections held in Kebbi and Abuja respectively on Monday, The PUNCH reports. The AFN has been engulfed in a leadership crisis since 2019, with Olamide George, the body’s vice president leading a faction, while Gusau, who was voted as the AFN president in 2017 in Abuja, led a faction and declared autonomy from the sports ministry, after a congress in Agulu, Anambra State, in December 2019. Both factions rebuffed reconciliatory moves by World Athletics and the Confederation of African Athletics and went ahead to elect their board members in separate polls. In Monday’s election held at the Jambali Hotel, Birnin Kebbi, Gusau was reelected after scoring 20 votes, to defeat Uche Nnukoma, who had two votes. Former Technical Director of the AFN, Sunday Adeleye, and Nneka Ikem also emerged first vice president and second vice president respectively in Kebbi. Adeleye polled 15 votes to defeat two other contestants Solomon Abari and Patrick Esther, who got four and three votes respectively. In Abuja, Okowa, who was the sole candidate, after other contestants Ahmed Kaita and Omatseye Nesiama withdrew, emerged president with 41 votes, with three votes voided. Former athlete Tafida Gadzama emerged first vice president with 43 votes, while Rosa Collins got 42 votes to become the second vice president. The Gusau-led board was inaugurated immediately, while the Okowa-led board would be inaugurated at the media centre of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday (today) by sports minister, Sunday Dare.
