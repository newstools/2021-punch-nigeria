FORMER Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Bode George, has advised the Federal Government to expedite action on devolution of powers to the states instead of wasting time on the ongoing constitution amendment. George spoke on a Radio programme “Ijoba Alagbada”, a Yoruba political platform aired on Diamond FM 88.7, monitored in Ilorin, on Sunday. He also used the occasion to comment about threats of secession by some groups. He said, “People are agitating for freedom because the present 1999 Nigeria Constitution cannot allow the various minority tribes to thrive in the country. “It was as a result of fear of the minority tribes that the military government led by Yakubu Gowon, created states. But now, every section of the country is educated and they want to have a say in the affairs of the country, so there is the need to review how they are being governed.” Speaking on the clamour for the setting up of another constitution review committee just like the Goodluck Jonathan administration did in 2014, George said, “I thank God that I participated in the Confab which is the first time that diverse people of the country would sit under the Chairmanship of Justice Idris Kutugi, now late who is very patient and wise. “The three-volume report was submitted to the government and it contains everything needed for the restructuring of the country. We don’t need to look elsewhere other than to implement the report. “The report was submitted to President Jonathan which he handed over to the present regime of President Buhari. There is no need for another constitution review committee. “It is a waste of time and resources, let us bring out the report of the 2014 Confab and start its implementation.” He appealed to separatist agitators such as the Indigenous People of Biafra to lay down their arms and embrace peace. He equally appealed to those seeking for the creation of Oduduwa Republic in the South West to sheathe their swords.
