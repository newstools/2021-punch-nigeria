Senior Vice President and Group Country Manager for Sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, Aida Diarra, has said that Visa is working on developing products that will expand access to digital payments for over 30 million mobile money customers. She said this at the 2021 Visa Africa Innovation for Inclusion Summit. Diarra said that over the last decade, the company had taken keen focus in collaborating with key players across the payment landscape on the continent to increase access to digital payments. She said, “We continue to partner with leading players in Sub-Saharan Africa including banks, fintechs, neobanks and telecommunications companies to enable new payment experiences that accelerate inclusion across the region. “Some of our latest partnerships are leveraging the power of mobile as an access point to financial inclusion, including a partnership to develop products that will expand access to digital payments at scale for over 30 million mobile money customers. “We are also driving access for small businesses through the launches of tap to phone and an exciting pilot that will serve as a solution to help small business owners digitise their business, covering payments, point of sale and access to credit, via a mobile device.” In 2019, Visa acquired a 20 per cent stake in Interswitch for $200m, affirming Interswitch unicorn status.
