The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has assured the workers in the state that he would continue to fulfil the promises made at the inception of his administration. Abiodun gave the assurance at the finale of the 2021 Public Service Day celebration at the Obas’ Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. A statement on Thursday said the governor described the workers as a vital instrument for the formulation and implementation of policies and programmes of the government, noting that they were the repository of knowledge on government’s decisions. He said, “On the inauguration of our administration on May 29, 2019, I stated that within the limit of available resources, we shall endeavour to be fair, open, just and equitable to all our workers, particularly, in the areas of massive re-training and relevant skill acquisition in ICT, welfare, provision of a conducive environment to enhance productivity, regular payment of salaries and other emoluments. Today, I am happy to tell you that we have continued to fulfil these promises in practical terms.” Earlier, in her welcome address, the Head of Service in the state, Selimot Ottun, urged the workers to channel their efforts at reforming the public service in accordance with the world’s best practices.
