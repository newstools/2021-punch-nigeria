Portland Paints and Products Nigeria Plc and Chemical Allied Products Plc have received the approval of the Federal High Court for their merger. The merger takes effect on July 1, 2021, according to a statement by Portland Paints. It said both companies would now effectively operate as one legal entity and be referred to as CAP. Portland Paints would be dissolved following the order granted by the court. The Managing Director of Portland Paints, Bolarin Okunowo, was quoted as saying, “The respective Boards of Portland Paints and CAP strongly believe that the merger, which provides a unique opportunity to change the Nigerian paints and coatings landscape is value accruable to shareholders of both companies, and will drive growth and expansion within the Nigerian and African markets. “Subject to the approval of the Exchange, the shares of Portland Paints will be placed on full suspension with effect from the close of business on June 30, being the business day immediately preceding the effective date and the date on which the register of members of Portland Paints will be updated for the purpose of determining the shareholders eligible to receive the scheme consideration.” “We remain available to address any questions our shareholders and relevant stakeholders may have in connection with the merger.” Copyright PUNCH.
