THE Committee of Pro-Chancellors of State-Owned Universities has called on the Academic Staff Union of Universities to de-emphasise the use of strikes as a means of negotiation with the Federal Government. Members of the committee made their position known in a communiqué made available to journalists on Sunday at the end of its 52nd quarterly meeting held in Abuja. The committee chaired by Yusuf Alli (SAN), also stressed the need for the removal of labour and wages from the exclusive list to allow state governments exercise appropriate control over their workers. It read, “Worried by the instability in the academic calendars of state universities fostered by incessant strikes by the academic and non-academic staff unions, the committee appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities to de-emphasise strikes as the major tool of negotiation with the Federal Government. “While observing that the disruption of the academic calendars has adversely affected the quality of the nation’s universities, their products and research outputs, the committee said the core values of education had been negatively impacted by the instability in the university system resulting in falling standards. “The structure and operation of the country’s federalism about public institutions established and owned separately by the federal and state governments under different laws have been a major problem of state universities. “State governments should be allowed to negotiate wages with their workers; the committee stated that the rights of trade unions to demand for welfare of its members should be based on employer-employee relationship.” Copyright PUNCH.
