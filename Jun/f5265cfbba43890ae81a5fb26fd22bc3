Gunmen numbering about 15 on Thursday attacked Ojoto Police Station in the  Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State. One police inspector was reportedly killed in the attack. A source told our correspondent that the police operatives on duty fought back and repelled the hoodlums, thereby preventing them from setting the station ablaze. “The hoodlums zoomed off when our men (police) fought back and warded them off. They came in three Sienna vehicles,” the source added. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, said he would want not to speak on the matter until after visiting the scene. He said, “I am planning to visit the area. I will not respond until after visiting the place.” A senior police officer in the state, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the incident. He said, “We lost one inspector today (Thursday) again. The state Commissioner of Police, Chris Owolabi, is preparing to visit the area.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
