Former Nigerian U-23 striker Kehinde Fatai has claimed that his dream of playing for the Romanian national team was thwarted by the Nigeria Football Federation, The PUNCH reports. Fatai, who was capped by Nigeria at U-20 and U-23 levels, added that despite being heartbroken, he had no regrets not playing for Nigeria at senior level, after scoring four goals in seven appearances for the U-23 team and one in three games for the U-20 side. The 31-year-old said the NFF told the Romanian FA that he was ineligible to switch allegiance as he had been listed for a 2012 Olympic Games qualifier against Tanzania. But he claimed that he did not feature in the game due to a stomach ache prior to the first leg clash in Dar Es Salam. “Honestly, I never felt that pressure to play for the Eagles after the NFF denied me a chance to play for Romania,” Fatai told The PUNCH. “I have no regrets not playing for the Super Eagles. Every player can’t and won’t play for the national team even if they deserve it. “The Romanian national team wanted me to play for them. They tried all they could to get me but the NFF blocked the move and ever since then I forgot about national team football. “It was very painful and very difficult to get over it because the coach of the Romanian national team at that time Vitor Piturca was eager to add me to his team. “He did everything but the Nigeria FA sent a letter to the Romanian FA that I was already in the Olympic squad for a game against Tanzania, but I didn’t play the game because I had a stomach ache.” Copyright PUNCH.
