The National Insurance Commission has sought the support of the National Health Insurance Scheme and the Federal Road Safety Corps on implementation of some of the compulsory insurance policies in the country. NAICOM disclosed that the FRSC and the commission expressed their readiness to cooperate on the enforcement of third party motor insurance when the Corp Marshall, Boboye Oyeyemi, and his team visited the commission. “Both parties have agreed to work out an effective plan for the enforcement of third party motor insurance,” the commission said. The commission also said it hosted the Executive Secretary, NHIS, Prof. Nasir Sambo, and his team. According to the commission, both parties agreed to work together on the implementation of professional indemnity insurance for health workers. The Head, Corporate Communications and Marketing Development, NAICOM, Salami Rasaaq, said the commission was committed to achieving its market development drives. He said that the Market Development and Restructuring Initiative was launched in 2009 as a vehicle to among others drive enforcement of compulsory insurances, reduce incidences of fake insurance and in the process grow the sector.
