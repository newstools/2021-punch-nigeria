President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has said the National Assembly must step up legislative interventions to protect Nigerians against the heightening spate of insecurity in the country. According to a statement by his Special Assistant(Press), Ezrel Tabiowo, this is needed to reduce the number of deaths caused by criminal activities. He said this on Tuesday when the upper chamber held one-minute silence six times during plenary to honour Nigerians who lost their lives to various forms of insecurity in the country. Lawan added that the interventions will be backed by collaborative efforts between the Legislature, Executive and Nigerians to address Nigeria’s security challenges. He said, “Let me observe that we have observed about six one-minute silences and most of it was to pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians who were murdered or killed by criminals. “It is very important that we step up our legislative intervention in ensuring that we protect the lives and properties of Nigerians to reduce the incidence of one-minute silence. “I believe that the Senate and, indeed, the National Assembly, working together with the Executive and getting the support of Nigerians, we can bring the much-needed succour to our people, and that is why we are here.”
