Ahead of the Super Eagles’ preparations for the African Cup of Nations and the Qatar World Cup tournament in 2022, Nigeria’s hygiene brand, Dettol, has partnered the Nigerian Football Federation as the ‘Official Hygiene Partner of the Super Eagles.’ At the unveiling ceremony in Lagos, the General Manager of Reckitt, sub-Saharan Africa, Akbar Shah, said Dettol would ensure the protection and well-being of the Super Eagles’ to enable the players to put their best foot forward during both tournaments. He noted that the brand would also work with the NFF to provide hygiene support for the audience and football fans of Nigeria. “Every year, the Super Eagles fly Nigeria’s flag high on the continental and global football stage. Behind every kick of the ball, every goal, every celebration is the spirit of over 200 million people. We understand the need to prioritise hygiene and health with the same fervour. A vital part of healthy living is good hygiene, and no other brand in Nigeria epitomises this like Dettol. “Dettol will provide hygienic protection for the Super Eagles during their pre and post-match activities as it already does in several Nigerian homes. It will keep the players in good health, powering them on their quest to entertain Nigerians and bring home the 2021 African Cup of Nations and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Not only that, Dettol will also work hand-in-hand with the NFF to provide hygiene support for the football fans of Nigeria,” Shah said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
