Gunmen on Thursday night invaded Kore in the Dambatta Local Government Area of Kano State and kidnapped a businessman identified as Emmanuel Eze, who has been residing in the area for years. It was gathered that the gunmen struck around 10:30pm on Thursday. According to an eyewitness account, the bandits, who arrived in the town in large numbers shot sporadically into the air before whisking away their victim. Flying bullets reportedly also injured a young man in the process. As of the time of filing this report, the bandits are yet to establish contact with the family members of the victim even as the police are currently combing the area to rescue the victim. The Kano State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident on Friday to newsmen, disclosed that the Commissioner of Police, Sama’ila Dikko, has dispatched a crack team of police detectives, to comb the area in search of the bandits, as well as to rescue the kidnapped businessman. According to the PPRO, “Bandits kidnapped Emmanuel Eze in his Provision Store, at Kore in Danbatta Local Government Area of Kano State.  A team of police officers have been mobilised to rescue and arrest the fleeing culprits.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Thursday, visited Army Headquarters in Abuja, raising serious concern that bandits are gradually infiltrating Kano forests.
