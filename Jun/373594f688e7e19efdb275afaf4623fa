Angry members of the All Progressives Congress in Lagos on Thursday stormed the party secretariat along Acme Road, Ikeja, in protest against irregularities and the refusal of the leadership to release the results of the local government primaries which took place on Saturday. It was gathered that the protests started on Wednesday, but more members came out on Thursday. Although the police had dispersed the protesters when our correspondent got to the area, it was gathered that the protesters demanded the release of the results, and alleged irregularities by the party leadership. One of them, who declined to be said, “We all came for different issues. Some politicians are trying to foist their candidates who did not win the elections on us. Also, why have they refused to release the results?” Our correspondent also observed that armed policemen were stationed along the road; and they did not allow vehicular movement and refused passersby to linger. As of the time our correspondent left the secretariat, the results of the primaries had not been released. The mobile phone of the APC spokesperson, Mr Seye Oladejo, rang out and he did not reply to a text message sent to him. The state police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, said he was “not aware” of the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
