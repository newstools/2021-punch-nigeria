Members of the Senate on Tuesday observed a minute’s silence to mourn ex-presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak, who was murdered in Owerri, the Imo State capital, on Sunday. Gulak was callously murdered by gunmen while he was on his way to catch a flight at Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri. At plenary on Tuesday, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, cited Order 43 to notify the Senate of the gruesome murder of Gulak. According to him, Gulak was on a national assignment on behalf of the Senate Committee on Constitution Review when he was killed. Also, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan said, “The late Hon. Ahmed Gulak was a very committed, dedicated citizen of this country. Very distinguished politician, who made tremendous contributions at both the state level in Adamawa and the National Level. “The murder of this Nigerian is something that our security agencies must unravel the murderer and the people behind the murder itself. This is necessary in all the murders and assassinations that take place in our country on almost a daily basis. “Our security agencies, particularly our intelligence agencies must continue to fish out such issues even before they happen. “Let me also join you in praying for the soul of Late Ahmed Gulak and also condole with his family, his State Government and the people of Nigeria.”
