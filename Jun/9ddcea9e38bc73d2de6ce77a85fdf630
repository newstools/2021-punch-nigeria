Former goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, claims Denmark’s players did not want to restart their Euro 2020 game against Finland after Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest. Schmeichel, the father of Leicester and Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he did not think the players had a choice. When asked if it was the players’ decision for the game to be restarted after Eriksen had been taken to hospital, Schmeichel said, “Well that’s an interesting debate. “I actually saw an official quote from UEFA yesterday saying that they were following the advice of the player, the players insisted on playing – I know that not to be the truth. “Or, it’s how you see the truth. They were left with three options, one was to play immediately and get the last 50 minutes played. “The next one was to come in yesterday at 12 noon and finish the 50 minutes and the third option was to forfeit the game 3-0.”
