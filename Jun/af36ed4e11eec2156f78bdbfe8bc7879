The governorship candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance in the 2019 gubernatorial election in Zamfara State, Dr Sani Shinkafi, has defected to the All Progressives Congress. Shinkafi, who formally declared his defection from APGA to APC while addressing his teeming supporters in his house, said he did not join the APC for material gain, adding that he was joining the state Governor, Bello Matawalle, to develop the state. He said, “I am leaving APGA not because I don’t like the party, but I am leaving APGA in order to join Matawalle in the APC to rebuild Zamfara State. “I was invited by Governor Bello Matawalle himself to join him in the APC, and as such, I see no reason why I should not join him.” He maintained that he was one of the founding fathers of APGA, adding that he had been in the party for 19 years and rose through the ranks to become its national secretary. “I am not forcing anybody to defect to APC and I will continue to relate with those who chose to remain in APGA because of our long existing relationship,” he added.
