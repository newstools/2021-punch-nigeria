THE National Population Commission has said population census may be conducted in 2022, once it completes its process of demarcation and administering questionnaire, adding that the exercise is subject to the president’s approval. Speaking on Tuesday during a press conference on the commencement of fieldwork for the first pre-test for population and housing census, the NPC Federal Commissioner in Gombe State, Abubakar Danburam, who delivered the address of the Chairman of commission, Nasir Kwarra, said the body had so far completed demarcation in over 600 local government areas out of the 774 in the country. Recall that population census was last conducted in Nigeria in 2006. NPC boss said the commission would soon suggest the census to the President, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), once entire processes was completed. He said, “It is within the purview of the President; we can’t precisely say this is the date. However, we are embarking on pre-census activities. He added, “These are the efforts we are making in view of the fact that census is absolutely necessary. We are on the verge of completing pre census, maybe in the next one year. We will suggest a date to Mr President and we are targeting maybe 2022.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
