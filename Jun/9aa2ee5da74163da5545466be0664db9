Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu  of Lagos State has said the 18.7-kilometre six-lane rigid pavement carriageway from Eleko Junction in Ibeju Lekki to Epe T-Junction in the state will be completed and inaugurated in the first quarter of 2022. According to a statement on Wednesday, Sanwo-Olu said this when he and members of the State Executive Council went on an on-the-spot assessment of the project on Monday. Recall that the governor commissioned the first phase of the expansion on the Lekki-Epe Expressway last November, kick-starting the rehabilitation of the 40-year-old infrastructure. The second phase of the project, which will start later this year, will continue from from Eleko Junction to Abraham Adesanya Junction in Eti-Osa axis. At the time of the Governor’s inspection, the contractor had completed a stretch of three kilometers on the lane from Eleko Junction inward Epe, while the right-of-way for the entire project has been fully cleared. The governor, who was excited by the work, expressed optimism that the project would be delivered on record time. He said, “The contractor has been active on site in the last six months. We are happy with the progress of the project, because the contractor works day and night. I believe the work is on track. “We are happy with what we have seen and we believe that the contractor should be rounding off the work by end this year or first quarter next year.” Copyright PUNCH.
