The founder of Senior Citizens Care Foundation, Aare Jide Taiwo, has commended the Federal Government for the creation of the National Citizens Centre signed into law in 2017 and the recent constitution of the governing board. According to him, it has proved that the government is listening to the requests of the aged. Taiwo made this known in a press statement to mark the 2021 International Elders Abuse Awareness Day in June. “As the Executive Director of Alake of Egbaland Free Medi-Care Initiative for the Elderly, I want to use the International Elders Abuse Awareness Day to request that state governments should follow the recommendations of the Federal Government by establishing senior Citizens Centres at state levels. “I also urge the authorities to allow professionals and experienced individuals to run the affairs of the centres.” Taiwo concluded. He also thanked stakeholders in the industry of care for elderly who had put in a lot of hard work in the past years to ensure Nigeria has senior citizens centres. Copyright PUNCH.
