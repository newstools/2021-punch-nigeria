A non-governmental organisation, Azeezat Olajumoke Gbenro Foundation, has called on the government to increase budgetary allocation to the health sector. The Coordinator of the foundation, Dr Idowu Bolanle, also urged organisations and well meaning Nigerians to support medical centres in improving the healthcare delivery in the country. Bolanle, who is United Kingdom-based General Practitioner, spoke shortly after the NGO donated two multi-parameter monitors to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi Araba, Surulere. According to her, the monitors take a great chunk of work from nurses and doctors, as they check patients’ vital signs, including blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, among others. She said the donation was to immortalise her late sister, Olajumoke Azeezat Gbenro, who died from sickle cell disease, a condition she battled for 50 years before her death in January 2021. “My sister lived in the UK and had access to excellent medical care. The grace of God and the excellent medical care she received contributed to the quality of life that she lived. Despite her health issues, her main focus in life was charitable giving. So, we thought the best way to honour her was to set up a charity in her name. “We believe that if everybody does a little bit here and there, perhaps our joint efforts as a community will change in our healthcare system. Also, the government needs to play its role. Nigeria needs to increase its budget. Health should be one of our top priorities when we draft our budgets. In the UK, huge funds are committed to the National Health Service, which means that anybody can access health at the same level as those who are rich and powerful and famous,” she added.
