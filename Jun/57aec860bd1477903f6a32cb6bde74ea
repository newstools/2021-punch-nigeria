Egbin Power Plc has unveiled plan to add 1,750 megawatts to Nigeria’s power generation, just as the company has partnered with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to deepen gas supply. The chairman of the company, Temitope Sonubi, unveiled this when the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Yusuf Usman, led a facility tour of the Egbin plant in Lagos on Monday. Unveiling the plan for the Egbin Phase 2 expansion investment, Sonubi said the expansion would add between 1,750 megawatts and 1900 megawatts to the country’s power generation. He said the plant had gone through major overhauling, which had helped to increase its generation from the lower capacity it had before the 2013 takeover from the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria. Sonubi stated, “Egbin has a 1,320 megawatt capacity. As at the time we took over, the plant was generating 300 megawatts, an abysmal 22 per cent. As of today, our generation capacity has surged and we do 89 per cent.” “We have reached 970 megawatts, the peak generation for the year and we are working hard to ensure the sustainability of this feat. Based on our core values, we are working round the clock to make sure that our gains are not lost.” He listed the challenges faced by the company to include grid limitation, gas constraints, and liquidity. He, however, commended the efforts of stakeholders including the NNPC, the Central Bank, and the Transmission Company of Nigeria whom he said had been working tirelessly and collaboratively to resolve the issues. He called on the NNPC to continue exerting efforts towards gas development and supply of the product to keep turbines at Egbin working productively at optimal capacity. Copyright PUNCH.
