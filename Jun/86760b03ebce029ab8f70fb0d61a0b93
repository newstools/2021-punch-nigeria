Fresh facts and photos have emerged from a Short Service Apartment where 21-year-old student of the University of Lagos, Chidinma Ojukwu, allegedly stabbed the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV, Usifo Ataga, to death. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the 300-level student of Mass Communication said she had been in a romantic relationship with Ataga for about four months before the ugly incident occurred at No 19, Adewale Oshin Street, Lekki, Phase 1, Lagos State. The car of the deceased was also recovered from the crime scene and taken to the police station. The suspect was later arrested at her residence at No. 57, Akinwunmi Street, Alagomeji, Yaba, last Wednesday and paraded on Thursday at the command headquarters in the Ikeja area of Lagos. When paraded, the UNILAG student confessed to stabbing 50-year-old Ataga to death on June 15, 2021. Ojukwu had also said that she and Ataga were “having fun” when an argument broke out and she stabbed him twice after which she withdrew N380,000 from his account using his ATM card. The suspect, who fled the scene, was, however, arrested at her father’s residence in the Yaba area of the state. Items recovered from the suspect include, “Complimentary cards, Access Bank Statement of Account, one Nigerian Passport with No.B50010434 belonging to the suspect, one fake Drivers license bearing Mary Johnson with the suspect’s photograph, one National Identification Card bearing the suspect’s name, one UBA ATM debit card bearing the suspect’s name and one University of Lagos ID card bearing the suspect’s name.” Meanwhile, the family of the deceased has called for a thorough investigation into the murder and asked to be left alone to mourn their beloved son, husband, father and brother. Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu said that “the case will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded”.
