The Association of Tutorial and School Operators, Mr Oludotun Sodunke, has said they are an integral part of the country’s education system. Sodunke was reacting to allegations made against ASTO on Wednesday by the Joint Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board, Registrar, Prof Isa’aq Oloyede. Oloyede had said the tutorial and school operators were aiding examination malpractice and had held candidates to ransom. The JAMB Registrar also referred to ATSO members as dropouts who took advantage of prospective JAMB applicants, adding that the state governments across the country should regulate them. Sodunke, however, said, ASTO consisted of responsible and professional tutors who through quality training had assisted several students in Nigeria to achieved their dream of gaining admission into higher institutions. He said, “We are an integral part of the education system in Nigeria. I am sure, Prof. Isa’aq Oloyede, knows the importance of tutorial centres. It is only an unreasonable person that will believe a tutorial centre is not needed. We are the one who help students with unmotivated teachers in their various schools to pass exams and we do the magic within three months. “A former Minister of Education Babs Fafunwa, owned a tutorial centre; so, tutorial centre owners are not dropouts. We want JAMB to bring out one tutorial centre that has been arrested for examination malpractice. “After conducting examination, JAMB will charge N2,500 for any mistake made, that is craftiness. We are doing legitimate business, JAMB should stop castigating us. We are responsible people and professionals. Generally, SMS is N4, why is JAMB collecting N50 from candidates?” Copyright PUNCH.
