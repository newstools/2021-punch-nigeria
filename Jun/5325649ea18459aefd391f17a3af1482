The Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Dr Bashir Jamoh, has said that the agency is trying to get the issues of security on Nigerian waters properly addressed through the Deep Blue project. He said this in Abuja when he visited Premier Academy School, Lugbe, to mark the Children’s Day. Jamoh said it was trying to get it right through the Deep Blue project that would be launched soon by President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). “We are now going out in full force to make sure we avert or stop this issue of maritime insecurity,” he said. According to him, there had been improvements in maritime security in the country since the deployment of assets under the Deep Blue Project began in recent months. He reiterated NIMASA’s commitment to capacity building in the maritime industry, noting that secondary schools in the country were a good place to begin the awareness. The current Cabotage regime, he noted, had opened up many opportunities in maritime for indigenous investors and professionals. The director-general said it would set up an endowment seat and scholarships for the best students from the school willing to study maritime-related courses in tertiary institutions. He said the agency was willing to train such students in Nigeria and abroad. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
