The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has issued guidelines for companies providing in-flight catering services to airlines operating domestic flights in Nigeria. According to the NCAA, catering service providers had been identified by the Authority as one of the key service providers to airlines that were required to put in place COVID-19 risk management measures to assure the travelling public that catering products served on board flights were not a potential sources of COVID-19 infection. In a circular issued by the NCAA on its website on the resumption of domestic flight operations in the country, in-flight catering companies were required by the Authority to carry out regular risk assessments of their operations, and put in place remedial actions to address any identified hazard to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 virus to their customers through their products. In consideration of the above, the statement said, “Catering in form of packed meals (food and snacks) can be served on domestic flights by in-flights catering companies who have carried out the appropriate risk assessment and have the approval of the NCAA. “Domestic airlines shall serve pre-packed catering products (meals and snacks etc.) in sealed containers to their passengers during disembarkation. “No catering products shall be served or consumed in-flight by airlines or passengers respectively on any domestic flight.” The NCAA also noted that the advisory circular newly issued supersedes previous circulars on in-flight catering services on domestic flights with respect to COVID-19 restrictions. It said, “All in-flight catering service providers are hereby required to comply with provisions of NCAA.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
