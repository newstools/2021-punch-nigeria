President Joe Biden opened the first overseas trip of his term on Wednesday with a declaration that the United States was back as he sought to reassert  his country on the world stage and steady European allies deeply shaken by his predecessor. The KVIA News reports that Biden has set the stakes for his eight-day trip in sweeping terms, believing the West must publicly demonstrate it can compete economically with China as the world emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. It is an open repudiation of his predecessor, Donald Trump, who scorned alliances and withdrew from a global climate change agreement that Biden has since rejoined. The president’s first stop was a visit with US troops and their families at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, where he laid out his mission for the trip. “We’re going to make it clear that the United States is back and democracies are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and issues that matter the most to our future. That we’re committed to leading with strength, defending our values, and delivering for our people.” The challenges awaiting Biden overseas were clear as the president and the audience wore masks — a reminder of the pandemic that is still raging around much of the world even as its threat recedes within the United States. “We have to end Covid-19 not just at home – which we’re doing – but everywhere,” Biden said.
