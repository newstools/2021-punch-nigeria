E.K. Oluwaga, 37/39, Ayobo Road, Oluwaga Bus Stop, Ipaja, Lagos State: The military leader who delivered the incongruous 1999 Constitution to us knows those who wrote it. He, and his cohorts, knew what they set out to achieve â€“ to vest their own sectional nests and interest. They are tribalists masquerading as nationalists, who did not deserve the universal honour and respect that had been showered and bestowed on them countrywide. The struggle for restructuring is like the struggle for the abolition of slave trade. And, those who benefit from slave labour are terribly afraid of the dire consequences of letting go the horse that treads the mill.
