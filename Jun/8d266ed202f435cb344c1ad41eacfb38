The kidnappers of the Eleda of Eda-Ile in the Ekiti East Council Area of Ekiti State, Oba Benjamin Oso, have set him free. The traditional ruler, who was on his farm with his wife on Friday, was whisked away into the forest by gunmen who invaded the farm. The gunmen were said to have demanded N20m ransom before they would release the monarch. A family source, however, told journalists on Monday that the king regained his freedom after N2m was paid to the gunmen on Sunday night.
The source, who noted that the kidnappers set Oba Oso free in the bush in a neighbouring community, said, “Kabiyesi was freed on Sunday night by the gunmen after the family paid about N2m out of the N20m initially demanded. The money was raised by many people. “As I speak with you now, he is receiving medical attention at a popular private hospital in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, confirmed the release of the traditional ruler. Abutu said, “Following our aggressive manhunt, the criminals abandoned the monarch in a forest between Ode Ekiti and Agbado Ekiti in the Gbonyin Local Government Area of the state. But the police are not aware of the request for and payment of any ransom”.
