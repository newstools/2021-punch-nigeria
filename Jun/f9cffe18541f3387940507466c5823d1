FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo has called on all agitators who promote disintegration of the country to shelve the idea and work for the unity and oneness of the country. According to Obasanjo, it is better for all ethnic groups in Nigeria to remain together. He said it would be “almost idiotic” for Nigeria to disintegrate. The former president advised that it was better for Nigeria to remain as one indivisible nation than for each tribe to go its separate ways. Obasanjo spoke at the luncheon and investiture of Kehinde Isijola as the new Chairman of Nigerian Institution of Surveyor, Ogun State chapter at the premises of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta. He said it was a wrong time for Nigeria to disintegrate at a time and age when Africa was trying to reintegrate for political, social and economic development. He said although the present situation in the country was not palatable, calling for the disintegration of the country was not the solution. Obasanjo who cited the examples of Pakistan, Yugoslavia and Sudan as countries that had broken away, but yet to find solutions to their problems, said Nigerians should blame themselves for the country’s woes rather than blaming God. He said, “I am a strong believer of one Nigeria, but not one Nigeria at any cost; one Nigeria where every Nigerian can feel proud that he or she has a stake in this country.” In his address, the state Chairman, NIS, Ademola Adebowale, disclosed that the Ogun State chapter of the institute had concluded plans to produce a unique digital map of Ogun State which would be updated regularly for meaningful and sustainable development.
