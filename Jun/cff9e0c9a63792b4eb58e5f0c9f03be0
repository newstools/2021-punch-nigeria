Leader of the Yoruba Self-Determination Group, Ilana Omo Oodua, Professor Banji Akintoye, on Sunday described the death of the founder of the Synago gue Church of All Nations, Prophet Temitope Joshua, as a terrible loss to the Yoruba Nation. Akintoye, who described the sudden passage of Prophet Joshua as a shock to him said the late cleric was “a credibly great servant of God with outreaches touching most part of the world and bringing charity to the needy everywhere, including to his people in the Akoko Area of Ondo State”. The renowned historian spoke in a statement by the group’s Communications Manager, Mr Maxwell Adeleye, titled, ‘TB Joshua’s death, a terrible loss to Yoruba Nation,’ made available in Ado Ekiti. He said, “In many countries across the world, people watch his (Joshua’s) ministry on television as he brings his gospel message with hope and joy. We, his people, will miss him greatly. We all pray that God will accept him into the joy of heaven. “I sympathise very deeply with members of his church and I pray that God continues to sustain them. I pray for strength for his young family too”, the statement added.
