Protesters from the Somolu Local Government Area of Lagos State on Thursday besieged the office of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to express their grievances over alleged imposition of the candidate for chairman for the local government election scheduled to hold on July 24. The people who were restrained by policemen manning the Lagos House, Ikeja gate, demanded that the governor or his representative speak to them. One of the protesters, Segun Awolesi said, “There was no election in Somolu. We have submitted our report to the state chairman and even Bourdilion. We are here for the governor’s intervention. The party should not impose any candidate on us.” Another protester, Abiodun Mustapha, said, “The Governor is also a beneficiary of direct primaries. He faced an incumbent and won.  The party asked us to go for a direct primary and we did, but it was cancelled. This is not the democracy that our leader Asiwaju Tinubu fought for against the military junta.” A leader in the LGA, who identified himself simply as Jaiye, said, “The election was inconclusive. They should conduct another primary.” The Lagos APC spokesperson, Mr Seye Oladejo said, “The party stands by the recommendation of the appeal committee and urge members to avail themselves of the reconciliation opportunity within the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
