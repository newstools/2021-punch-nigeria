FC Midtjylland sports director, Svend Graversen, believes Super Eagles midfielder Frank Onyeka is ready for the big switch to the English Premier League following interest from newcomer Brentford. But according to Graversen, despite strong reports linking the Nigeria international with Brentford, the FC Midtjylland’s sister club are not the only club interested in the player, ahead of his potential departure from the Danish Superliga side in the summer transfer window. Speaking with Danish sports magazine, Tipsbladet, the club’s sports director hinted that Onyeka’s imminent move to England could be confirmed by Friday. He said, “There is also something in the fact that he has the interest of a lot of clubs. Our evaluation of Frank is that he is ready for one of the big leagues. “One has to assess that the Premier League is perhaps the biggest, so he is ready for that. Then we must find the right solution, and he must not least think it is the right solution. Then we have to see where it ends. “But there is no doubt that he has deserved it, and he is where a change is right for him. Then we must find the right solution for all three parties.” FC Midtjylland and Brentford are owned by the same man, Matthew Benham. Rasmus Ankersen, who is chairman of the board of FCM, is also sports director at Brentford. The 23-year-old Onyeka has spent the past four seasons with Midtjylland, featuring in 123 matches and scoring 17 goals. He made his Nigeria debut in a friendly against Algeria last October.
