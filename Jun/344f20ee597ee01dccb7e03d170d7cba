Every year on the 1st of June, World Milk Day is commemorated to mark the importance and contribution of milk to our nutrition, our enjoyment, and our connection as a global community. Just as well, on every World Milk Day for a good number of years, Dano Milk has led Nigeria in the most amazing, engaging, and memorable celebrations both online and offline. Due to COVID regulations since 2020 however, the brand has focused the celebration online and worked twice as hard to ensure a worthy milk-honouring fest. This year, the brand decided to take Nigerians on a milky cruise, starting conversations with definitions of catching cruise and milky cruise. These conversations paved the way for engaging posts featuring milk puns and fun history throwbacks. The Milky Cruise challenge kicked off on the 25th of May through to the 29th, calling on the audience to prove their love for milk in creative ways. On World Milk Day, with well-known influencers and entertainers like Nengi, Ric HassaniMr Macaroni, Samuel Mbah and brand ambassadors like Rachel Okonkwo, Funnybone, and JaiyeKuti, the audience was invited to participate in Milk Oâ€™ Clock challenges that lasted a single hour at specific hours of the day. Although this was very successful and about a hundred persons were rewarded, the brand also made room for those not online to participate in the Milky Cruise by enlisting a live cruise in Ibadan and Port Harcourt. Members of the public who purchased milk products on the 1st of June at trade centres like Spar, Victoria Island and Shoprite, Ikeja were also rewarded at a Dano Milk stand on the premises. At the wrap of World Milk Day 2021, the brand salutes all milk lovers and looks forward to many more years of enjoyment and merriment with milk!
