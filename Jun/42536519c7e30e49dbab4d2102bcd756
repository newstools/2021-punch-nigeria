Nigerian rapper, Jude Abaga popularly known as MI, has declared his solidarity for people from the South-Eastern region of Nigeria known as ‘Igbos’. The popular rapper on Wednesday took to Twitter to show love and support for Igbos, calling on other Nigerians to do the same as he launched the #IAmIgboToo campaign. This comes shortly after the President of Nigeria, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), sent a warning that was perceived as a threat to the Igbos who had commemorated their counterparts that died during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-1970. The President, in a now-deleted tweet, had written, “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” Reacting to the tweet, MI posted a video with the caption, “The narrative that ‘Nigeria hates Igbo people’ is an outdated context that will leave with the old and bitter generation. Today let us stand with our Igbo family and say #IAmIgboToo.” In the video, he said, “I can’t imagine being an Igbo citizen and seeing those tweets yesterday. I can’t imagine how it would have made them feel. “So, I thought it could be beautiful today if we rally round organically on Twitter. Just post videos and messages on our timeline to tell our Igbo brothers and sisters that we are one and that we are Igbo too.” As of the time of the report, the #IAmIgboToo campaign is the highest trend in the Nigerian Twitter space.
