WBA cruiserweight No.1 title challenger, Efetobor Apochi, says he is confident of knocking out American, Brandon Glanton, when both fighters clash in their highly anticipated ‘Fight of The Unbeatens’ at the Minneapolis Armory on June 27. Apochi is unbeaten in 11 professional fights, knocking out all his opponents, with only Earl Newman going the farthest, reaching the seventh round since making his professional debut in 2017. His opponent, Glanton is also unbeaten in 13 professional fights, recording 11 knockouts since becoming a professional in 2017. Thity-three-year-old Nigerian Apochi is coming off a huge knockout win over highly-rated Deon Nicholson in April, and is confident he can replicate the action against another unbeaten contender, Glanton. “I’m going to knock him (Glanton) out, he is a boy to me and I am confident he will kiss the canvas in no time,” Apochi told The PUNCH. “He made things worse for himself when he called me out but I know he is scared because he stopped posting on Instagram like he used to, and I’m going to deal with him.” Copyright PUNCH.
