The Kwara State Government has distributed 40 Ipads to the Quality Assurance Officers in the state as part of its effort to improve the quality of school monitoring and evaluation. The Chairman, Kwara State Universal Basic Education Board, Prof.  Shehu Adaramaja, disclosed this during a two-day workshop organised for the Quality Assurance department on the current trends in school evaluation for effectiveness and efficiency. Adaramaja said the importance of training cannot be underestimated, describing it as a complete paradigm shift from the manual reporting of school evaluation to the use of electronic evaluation reporting. He added that the shift became imperative because school monitoring and evaluation needed to be reported accurately and promptly. Adaramaja expressed hope that the training would enhance productivity and efficiency, saying it would check officers who indulged in cutting corners without getting to their assigned schools. “This giant step has made it possible for the state to key into modern reporting and evaluation. Kwara State is one of the few states that paid for an additional number of personal computer tablets to train and equip its officers for the electronic quality assurance,” he said. The Director-General of National Space Research and Development Agency, Dr Hamilu Shaba, said the training was focused on capacity building for the workers of SUBEB. Copyright PUNCH.
