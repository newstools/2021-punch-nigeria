SOME gunmen on Tuesday shot and killed MraIsa Shelda, an Assistant Manager at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium in Jos, Plateau State. An eyewitness, Kabiru Musa, told The PUNCH in Jos on Tuesday that Shelda died instantly after he was shot four times by the gunmen in front of the stadium. Narrating how the incident occurred, Musa said, “The Assistant Manager came to work today as usual and was sitting in front of the stadium in the afternoon with some friends. “As they were discussing, some gunmen suddenly alighted from a bike and headed towards his direction. Immediately, he saw them, he made to escape but it was too late for him, as the gunmen  attacked him in front of the stadium gate and shot him four times in the head. “He died instantly. As I speak with you, his corpse was still lying on the ground not very far from where he had earlier parked his 406 Peugeot car. We don’t know why the gunmen shot and killed him that way.” When The PUNCH visited the stadium around 4:30 pm on Tuesday, the remains of the Assistant Manager was said to have been evacuated to the mortuary by the police while a crowd was seen discussing the incident. When contacted, the spokesman for the state Police Command, Ubah Ogaba said, “When we heard that there was an incident at the stadium, we quickly deployed our men to the scene.” Copyright PUNCH.
