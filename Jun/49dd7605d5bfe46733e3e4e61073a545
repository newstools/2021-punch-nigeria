The Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, has announced a financial reward of N195m for the athletes that represented the state at the 2020 National Sports Festival more than two months after the event in Edo State last April. This was contained in a statement on Thursday by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah. The money will be shared among the gold, sliver and bronze medallists as well as the coaches and secretaries of the teams. Bayelsa placed third on the final medals table behind Delta and Edo, with 56 gold, 57 silver and 58 bronze medals to place third, surpassing their fourth place record since the 2006 edition of the Games in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Diri urged the athletes to reciprocate the gesture by improving on their performance at the next festival. He said, “Your next sports festival in 2022 began the day Edo 2020 ended. I’m sure that if you go to Asaba 2022 with the same passion, patriotism and commitment you exhibited in Edo, you will surpass your performance. That is why I charge you not to relent in order to go beyond your current position.” The Governor also announced the adoption of two Bayelsa-born athletes in line with the Adopt-An-Athlete Initiative of the sports minister Sunday Dare. The adopted athletes are Tokyo Olympic-bound wrestler and African and Commonwealth champion in wrestling, Blessing Oborududu, and 17-year-old sprinter, Tima Godbless, who won a silver medal in the women’s 200m and bronze in the 4×100 meters relay at Edo 2020. Earlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Youths and Sports Development, Daniel Igali, stated that with 568 athletes at the festival, Bayelsa won 56 gold, 57 silver and 58 bronze medals to place third.
