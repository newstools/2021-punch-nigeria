The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said that the people who misbehaved during the EndSARS protests will not get away with it. Buhari disclosed this during an exclusive interview with the Nigerian Television Authority on Friday. The President was asked to explain what he meant by his tweet which was tagged genocidal on Twitter. He said “What I mean is how can you go to a police station, kill the police people who are there, loot the armoury and burn the place? What do you want to achieve? “Go and open prison and allow criminals who have been tried by the legal system and let them escape and how can government sit aside and allow this confusion to be perpetrated? “All they need is confusion and no government can allow confusion. “Look at the  EndSARS incident. The previous governor of Lagos State bought 200 buses to complement the transportation in Lagos and he built a complex involving railways but they went and burnt them. “The present governor made an album and came  to see me I said ‘thank you very much.’ I took the album, put it in my archive, and told him to tell Lagosians to work because we don’t have the money after the government bought 200 buses for some people to come and burn it. So, let them work.” The President was further asked if he was going to react in a “fire for fire” way and he said, “We will arrest them, try them, give them very bad publicity and then jail them so that people will know that if they misbehave, they will not get away with it.”
