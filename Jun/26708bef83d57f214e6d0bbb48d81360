The gunmen who kidnapped a farmer, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, at a farmstead in Iyemero Ekiti, in the Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State, on Friday have demanded N30m from his family. A source in the farmstead said on Sunday that “the people who kidnapped Alhaji had contacted the family asking for money. They are demanding N30m.” Recall that the gunmen numbering about 18, had attacked the farmstead around 11pm on Friday, shooting indiscriminately and took Olodan away. A source had said, “Between 10pm and 11pm on Friday, we heard gunshots and the gunmen appeared. “When they saw Alhaji (Olodan), they took him away. They did not come with any vehicle.” However, the gunmen were said to have contacted the family around 7.38pm on Saturday, asking for N30m, raising tension in the family. The source said, “They are asking for N30m, which the family described as outrageous. But they are running around to raise some money to pacify the abductors. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, said, “We are not aware that the abductors have contacted the family for ransom. Our men are, however, combing the surrounding bushes in collaboration with local hunters and Amotekun Corps to rescue the man,” Abutu said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
