Popular technology company, Spotify, has made its first attempt at creating an audio social media platform, Greenroom, which was launched on Android and iOS on Wednesday. Similar to the Clubhouse app, Greenroom enables users to host live conversations on a wide range of topics. According to The Verge, though the launch does not come with a specially planned event, Spotify has been encouraging people to sign up on the app and explore the features and specifications in the app. Spotify built the app on Locker Room, which was created by Betty Labs but acquired by Spotify in March. The app has a Spotify green-and-black colour scheme and its functionality includes a range of features including native recording, which would allow users to save their shows and share them as podcasts with the public. Users have the option to sign in to the app using their Spotify login. However, the Spotify login is not mandatory to use the app. With the initial sign-up flows, users would be allowed to select their interest from different range of topics like sport teams and music genres. Before Clubhouse launched in April, most technology companies did not adopt social audio platforms. Now, it has been embraced by platforms such as Twitter, which has Spaces; and Facebook, which has Live Rooms.
