He commended the party for embarking on the exercise saying, it was a development that gave members a true sense of belonging. According to Giadom, the exercise has provided members of the party with the ownership of the party. “Most of the complaints forwarded to the committee were minor issues however, there is the need to look into the issues raised in Kwara, Ogun, Imo, and Rivers states.” In response, Buni was quoted as saying, “The party will consider the recommendations made by the committee and every issue raised based on their merits. “We all have a responsibility in rebuilding and repositioning this party to remain Nigeria’s leading political party.”
