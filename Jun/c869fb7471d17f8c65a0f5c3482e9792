Anambra governorship aspirant, Azuka Okwuosa, has promised to revitalise agriculture in the state. He said this while unveiling his plans to make the state achieve its desired economic growth. He said, “Pay close attention to the Nigerian economy, and you will observe that past governments have primarily underestimated the agricultural sector. As a country, we are spoiled with fertile ground, and we possess the climatic requirements for a thriving agricultural industry. However, we still suffer the predicaments of a country that has less fortuity for successful agrarian productivity. “In the 2020 Global Hunger Index, Nigeria had a GHI score of 29.2. On the GHI performance chart, this implies that Nigeria has a level of hunger that is “serious”. It is a general opinion that the government should tackle agriculture at all levels to undo this unfortunate situation. Steps in this direction have not been visible to the populace. When elected, the spirant said he intends to exploit all agricultural possibilities to end hunger in Anambra. He explained that the performance of the sector transcends other aspects of the economy and society in general. He said, “Asides from its role in eliminating hunger, agriculture is a massive employer of labour at every level. According to his analysis, it would translate to the creation of enormous demand in the state’s labour market. This demand will increase the productivity of individuals, especially youths, giving them a chance to earn an honest living, thereby reducing the crime rate within the state.”
He argued that agriculture would contribute immensely to the fight against insecurity in the state.
