The Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, will defect to the All Progressive Congress on Tuesday. A grand rally has been organised for Matawalleâ€™s defection to APC which will hold at the Trade Fair Complex in Gusau, the state capital by 10am. The governor will be received by APC officers both from the state and the national level. The PUNCH gathered that Matawalle had been planning to dump the Peoples Democratic Party for the APC since his colleagues from the Southern part of the country accused him of controlling the gold mines in the state. Matawalle was bitter when the PDP Southern Governors expressed displeasure at his plan to sell gold to the Central Bank of Nigeria. He will be defecting to the APC along with the states and the National Assembly members except a member representing Anka Mafara Federal Constituency, Honourable Kabiru Mafara. The Deputy Governor, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau and few officials of the PDP might remain with the PDP.
