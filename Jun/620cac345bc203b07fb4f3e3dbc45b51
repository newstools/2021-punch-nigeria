The Executive Director, Kishimi Shelter and Care Foundation, Grace Samuel, has urged state actors to domesticate the Child Rights Act for the protection of both child and the parent. Gombe is one of the 15 states yet to domesticate the act, according to National Human Rights Commission. Samuel spoke on Saturday at the commemoration of 2021 Day of African Child, organised by Kishimi Shelter and Care Foundation in partnership with Save the Children International and funded by Global Affairs Canada. She said, “The significance of the day is to honour the children who were killed in Soweto in 1976, when they challenged the discrimination regarding education, when white children were given better and quality education more than the blacks. “The day is also to appeal to the conscience of governments, individuals, parents because the problem of the African child has not changed. “We appeal to government to do things for the wellbeing of children. The target of 2040 is for all the nations to have a legal document that protects the African child. In Nigeria, the Child Rights Act has yet to be domesticated in some states, including Gombe. We are advocating that issues involving the child should be taken seriously.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
