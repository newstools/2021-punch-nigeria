The Institute of Directors Nigeria has urged the government to focus on building an enduring business environment through renewable capacity, women and youth empowerment, climate-smart agriculture and overall economic diversification. The immediate past President, IOD Nigeria, Chief Chris Okunowo, said the government should emphasise the need to diversify Nigeria’s economy and ensure growth in non-oil exports. Okunowo said these at the 37th Annual General Meeting of the institute in Lagos, stating that these measures would help in achieving an inclusive economic recovery. “Government needs to deepen the conversation regarding insecurity and poverty in the nation to help the survival of the nation. “The government also needs to consolidate the ongoing reforms, related to the removal of fuel and electricity subsidies, and a massive programme on the harmonisation of citizens’ data.” Recounting the achievements of the institute, Okunowo stated that the IOD was recognised as a model professional organisation and strong advocacy for best corporate governance practices in the private and public sector. “The institute has become a bellwether for what is possible, what is desirable and what is edifying in Nigeria’s path to globally recognised corporate excellence.” He added that the institute had also deepened alliances with the Lagos Business School and the Nigeria Institute of Policy & Strategic Studies and had the launched Young Directors’ Forum.
