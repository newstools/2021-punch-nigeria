The Lagos State Government has asked youths in the state to shun acts of violence and pursue peace as the nation celebrates the Democracy Day on June 12. The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Segun Dawodu, stated this on in Alausa, Ikeja, where he received members of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Lagos State chapter. A statement on Thursday, said Dawodu advised against a repeat of last year’s incident, especially the #EndSARS protest, adding that the ongoing agitation among youths on the social media should not be allowed to degenerate into chaos and public unrest. The commissioner urged the youth to engage the government more by employing legitimate channels to air their grievances. He noted that the present administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had prioritised issues affecting youths not only in words but by actions. “The Ministry of Youth and Social Development has embarked on numerous programmes and executed different projects across the state in this regard. These include the upgrading of youth centres with state-of-the-art facilities across the state, interactive sessions with voluntary youth organisations.” He appealed to parents to watch over their children and monitor their movement in order to avoid being lured by elements with disruptive tendencies into any act capable of truncating the relative peace and tranquility enjoyed by Lagosians.
