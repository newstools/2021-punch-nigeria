Analysts at Cordros Capital noted that although the market closed positive on three of the week’s four trading sessions, the gains proved insufficient in pushing the market to a green close for the week. They said, “We observed that investors took full advantage of the gains recorded over the last two weeks in booking profit on bellwether stocks. “We expect market performance to remain mixed in the week ahead as investors rotate their portfolio towards dividend-paying stocks, which intermittent profit-taking activities would match.” The analysts advised investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remained a significant headwind for corporate earnings.
