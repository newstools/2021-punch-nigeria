Oyo State Government has commenced the evacuation of beggars from shanties in the state’s capital, Ibadan, to Akinyele resettlement centre in the state. In a statement released on Tuesday by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor, Taiwo Adisa, it was revealed that while the evacuation process started months ago, the relocation of the beggars formally commenced on Tuesday morning. The beggars conveyed from their shanties on Jemibewon Road, Sabo area of Ibadan to the newly built Akinyele Resettlement Centre, which was earlier toured by Arewa community leaders, and representatives of the beggars on Saturday. Adisa also disclosed in the statement that “the State’s Commissioner for Environment, Barrister Idowu Oyeleke, who led the first set of evacuees to Akinyele, said that the new site is fitted with social amenities including schools, hospitals, and recreation centres.” Aside from the ministry of environment, other ministries involved in the exercise include Women Affairs and Social Inclusion, Information, Culture and Tourism, Local and Chieftaincy Matters as well as the Office of the Executive Secretary, Oyo State Security Trust Fund. The CPS said the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde started the evacuation of beggars in October 2019 when about 48 street children, beggars and others were taken from the streets to rehabilitation centres in the state capital.
