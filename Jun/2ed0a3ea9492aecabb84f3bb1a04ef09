Reality television shows aficionados are set for a good time as an international reality TV show, Love Island, will start showing in the country in October. A businessman and the executive producer of the show, Toyin Subair, stated during an event to intimate journalists about the TV show that it ‘perfectly sums the expectations Nigerians have of entertainment’. According to Subair, Love Island Nigeria, which is the first version of the reality show to have an all-black cast, will give 20 singles an opportunity to come together and ‘share the true essence of love, romance, friendship and relationship with all the twists and intrigues in about six exciting weeks’. The producer of the show, Neil Oyenekan, also noted that it was for single people who were serious about getting a partner. He said, “At the moment, we are looking at everyone who is under the age of 30 or thereabouts. If we want to go higher, it would depend on the applications that come in. However, it is majorly for single people who are serious about searching for partners.” The Executive Producer of the show, Odiri Iwuji, also noted that one of the objectives of the programme was to showcase Nigerian relationships to other parts of the world. He said, “We will like to show to the world exactly how love is shown here. The good thing about the show is that it will not only be screened in Nigeria. We are working on distribution deals that will enable people from other parts of the world watch it on different platforms. The idea is to show Nigerian relationships and lifestyle to the rest of the world.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
