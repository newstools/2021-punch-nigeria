PLATEAU State Governor, Simon Lalong, has urged Nigerians to ensure that only those who were prepared to serve were given the opportunity to emerge as leaders. Lalong made the call in Jos, during a Democracy Day church service, held at the Government House Chapel, Rayfield, on Sunday. He said, “There is no doubt that Nigeria is facing many challenges today ranging from insecurity, unemployment, poverty and unity. These are not problems that began yesterday but an accumulation of our journey to nationhood. We should never give up on our nation or make negative confessions about its destiny. “At the same time, we must also work on our political recruitment process to ensure that the people that emerge as leaders are prepared to serve and not be served. “They should possess leadership qualities such as love, peace, tolerance, accountability, selflessness, self-control among others.” Guest preacher and Executive Secretary, Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission, Rev. Yakubu Pam, who took the Bible reading from Mathew 26:36-46, spoke on “Grace” where he said Nigeria will continue to experience divine protection and deliverance through its most difficult challenges. Chairman of the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Fr. Polycarp Lubo, in a goodwill message, said the 22 years of unbroken democracy has brought about many opportunities for popular participation and contribution to good governance over the years. APC State Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mr. Letep Dabang, representatives of the Judiciary, House of Assembly, Security Agencies, and Traditional Council all expressed hope that contrary to the fears expressed by many, Nigeria will fulfil its purpose.
