The Lagos State Traditional Medicine Board has expressed its readiness to partner with the United State Agency for International Development to further prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS from infected mothers to their babies. A statement on Sunday said the Chairman of the board, Prof. Adebukonla Adefule-Ositelu, disclosed this when the representatives of USAID paid a visit to LSTMB at Onikan. She said, “The cooperation from USAID to eradicate mother-child transmission of HIV/AIDS is a welcome development.  For traditional birth attendants, it is a mandatory thing that every pregnant woman that comes around must be tested for HIV.” Adefule-Ositelu stated that although LSTMB had worked with registered traditional birth attendants over the years to curb the transfer of HIV from infected mothers to infants, there was still the need to educate the people to know their HIV status. “One thing we are also looking at is to have a lot of media advocacy to educate people. We are not going to be forcing mothers to have a test, but we would be encouraging them so that the mother and child and even husband can be safe by knowing their HIV status,” she added. A representative of USAID, Mr Kolawole Olatubosun, said, “Not all babies are born in the orthodox and conventional hospitals and our mandate includes reaching such babies who are born using traditional birth attendants. Hence the need for us to strengthen our relationship with LSTMB to achieve our aim,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
