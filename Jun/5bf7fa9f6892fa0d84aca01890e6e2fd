Traders at the Ngwa Road Market have appealed to Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to honour his promise of ensuring that none of them will lose their shops when the new market is completed. The Chairman, Ngwa Road Market Traders Association, Mr Chijindu Ojogho, made this appeal in Aba during the foundation laying ceremony for the reconstruction and expansion of the market and thanked the governor for his assurances. He urged the governor to fulfil his promise as the traders were committed to supporting the policies of his administration. Speaking during the event, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Trade and Investment, Chief Michael Egwu, assured the traders that none of the traders would lose their shop as a result of the reconstruction, adding that within eight weeks, the first phase of Lines 1 and 2 would be completed. Egwu appreciated the traders for dropping their agitation and assured them that the cost of renewing the ownership of their shops would not be a burden to them, adding that the government had agreed with their leaders on the amount, which would be made known to them later. Earlier, the developer of the market and Managing Director, Peacock Urban Regeneration Limited, Dr Uju Anosionwu, urged the traders to accept the interim discomfort they might experience and assured them that in the next seven weeks, the first phase would be completed, while the entire project would be completed by December this year. According to him, the market has facilities such as health centre, cold room, 24-hour solar light and generator, and will be fireproof. The traditional ruler of Ohazu Kingdom, Eze Sunday Emejiaka, urged the traders to cooperate with the contractor. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
