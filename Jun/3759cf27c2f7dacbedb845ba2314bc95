THE Ebonyi State Government said on Monday that those who invaded and attacked communities bordering Ebonyi and Benue States on Sunday morning were Fulani herdsmen. Recall that there was an attack in Ndiobasi and Obakotara communities in the Ado Local Government Area of Benue State, which shares boundary with Ohaukwu, Ebonyi and Izzi LGAs of Ebonyi State, in the early hours of Sunday. The PUNCH reports that the inhabitants of the affected communities are mostly natives from Ebonyi and Izzi LGAs of Ebonyi State. Reacting to the development on Sunday evening, the state government confirmed the incident, adding that houses were equally burnt in the attack. The Commissioner for Internal Security, Border Peace and Conflicts Resolution, Chief Stanley Okoro-Emegha, stated this in a statement made available to journalists on Sunday. The statement read, “The Ebonyi State Government has observed with dismay the invasion of Nwori Ndi-Obasi Village in Ado LGA of Benue State in the early hours of today, Sunday, 30th May, 2021. “The unfortunate incident was perpetrated by suspected herders who ruthlessly attacked unsuspecting inhabitants of the village, killing, maiming and burnt down several houses. “To forestall possible spill over of the attack to the neighbouring villages of Okwofuruike and Ohabuleodo respectively, in Izzi and Ebonyi LGAs, Ebonyi State Government effectively mobilised and dispatched a combined team of security agencies and members of Ebube Agu security outfit to ensure that peace and normalcy is restored in the troubled area.” Copyright PUNCH.
