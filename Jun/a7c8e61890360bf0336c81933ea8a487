The Lagos State Government has urged the administrative and account officers in the pension administration agencies to come up with creative and faster ways of serving pensioners in the state. The Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Mrs Ajibola Ponnle, said this at the training workshop for administrative, human resources and finance and account officers at the Public Service Staff Development Center, Magodo. She disclosed that Lagos State has been internationally acclaimed to be the most pension compliant state in Nigeria, which necessitates innovative ways of serving pensioners. She said, “Lagos State is a trailblazing state that has been internationally acclaimed as the most pension compliant state in the country. We should not rest on our oars as we continue to find better, newer and faster ways to serve pensioners.” Similarly, the Permanent Secretary in the Civil Service Pensions Office, Dr Olayiwole Onasanya, charged the officers to continue to make Lagos the benchmark of pension administration in Nigeria. “Let me inform you that your labour and sweat is pivotal in the decision of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners to honour Governor Sanwo-Olu with the distinguished award of ‘Excellence and Greater Commitment to Pensioners Welfare’ at its 11th Quadrennial National Delegates Conference,” he stated.
