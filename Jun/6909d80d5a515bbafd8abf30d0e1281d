The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said that the Federal Government has no more job vacancies, adding that if they continue to promote insecurity, there will be no jobs from foreign investment. He said this on Friday during an exclusive interview with the Nigerian Television Authority. Buhari said, “As I said, the number one thing is security. If you don’t secure the country, people will not invest. ‘That was why those who organised the EndSARS. I sent all the Ministers back to their constituencies. “Constitutionally, the ministers represent their states. “So I asked them to go to their states. Let them speak to their Governors, their political leaders, traditional rulers, and very importantly, let them speak to the youths that the Federal Government says there is no more vacancy, virtually every department is filled. “The same thing in the states and local governments. “So you can have a good degree from a good university and you will never get a job. Because if you promote Insecurity by burning factories, institutions nobody will come and invest. “So it’s in their own interests that Nigeria is secure. “When the country is secure it’s potentially rich because God has endowed Nigeria with resources. “People will come and invest. Countries that have something to invest, must make sure that they can recover their investments.”
