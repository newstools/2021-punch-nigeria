The Lagos State chapter of the National Association of Nigerian Students says open grazing and banditry are bigger threats to Nigeria than social media platform, Twitter. It, therefore, called on the Federal Government to immediately lift the suspension of Twitter. The demand was made in a statement titled, ‘Twitter Ban: You are pushing us to the wall’ which was jointly signed by Chairman, Joint Campus Committee in Lagos State, Olalere Moshood; and Tomomewo Seunfunmi, the Public Relations Officer The students vowed to shut down Lagos, the commercial nerve of the country, over the continuous infringement on the rights of citizens. The Lagos NANS Chairman argued that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is becoming unpopular with its ill-birthed ideas and policies which do not conform to the 21st century realities. He wrote, “Twitter has been a source of living to many students who fend for themselves and their family, then what becomes of them when that source is gone. “The Federal Government should have issued a warning instead of banning what has become a way of life to youths across the state and the nation at large. There are more pressing issues on the table like the banning of open grazing; rather you took Twitter as a bigger security threat than the general issues. “You can’t be more powerful than the people who voted for you, ban open grazing, not Twitter to show how serious you are.” The student leader, however, hinted that they may shut down the state if the issues concerning security and infringement of rights are not addressed.
