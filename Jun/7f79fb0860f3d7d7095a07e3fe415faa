Giants First Bank on Tuesday beat War Queens of Sango-Ota 78-22 at the D.K Olukoya Girls Basketball Championship at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos. The Elephant Girls were far too experienced for their opponents and they made it count with the resounding result. In other games, IGP Queens beat Delta Force 50-47 in a keenly-contested tie. The Abraham Ogaba-led IGP Queens had a rough start to the game, losing the first quarter 12-9 but fought back in the second quarter to take a one-point lead (21-20). However, Delta Force reacted quickest after the break but ran out of steam late in the third quarter, setting up a nervy fourth quarter, which was edged by the IGP Queens 29-27, while Sunshine Angels outshined Raptors Girls 52-37. Day 3 (today) will feature War Queens and Raptors Girls battling for their first win of the tournament, while IGP Queens target their second win against Warrior Amazons. Also, Sunshine Angels battle First Bank, and MFM play the final match of the day against Delta Force.
