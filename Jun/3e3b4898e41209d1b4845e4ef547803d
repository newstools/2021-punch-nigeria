The House of Representatives has confirmed the nomination of Major General Farouk Yahaya as Chief of Army Staff. The confirmation followed the consideration and adoption of the screening report by the House’ Committees on Defense and Army at the plenary on Tuesday. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had announced Yahaya’s appointment one week after the demise of the immediate past COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 others in a plane crash in Kaduna. He subsequently asked the Senate and the House to confirm the appointment of Yahaya. During his screening, the nominee, who was asked to introduce himself, had recalled that he had worked in all the strategic positions, departments and units of the Nigerian Army, making him understand their peculiarities and situations. He added that he served on international war and peace-keeping missions including in Liberia. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
