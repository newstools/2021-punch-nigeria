The Senate on Tuesday observed a minute silence in honour of the late Founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet Temitope Joshua, who died on Saturday at the age of 57. The Deputy Leader of the Senate, Professor Ajayi Boroffice, who is also the Senator representing Ondo North Senatorial District, drew the attention of his colleagues to the death of the late prophet. Joshua, who hailed from Arigidi Akoko, would have celebrated his 58th birthday in June. Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, prayed for the repose of the soul of the late prophet and for God to grant his family the fortitude to bear the loss.
