Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Lofven on Monday resigned, one week after he lost a vote of no confidence in parliament, leaving it up the speaker of parliament to begin the search for a replacement. Noting the difficult situation the Covid-19 pandemic posed, coupled with the fact that the next general election is a year away, Lofven told a press conference a snap election was “not what is best for Sweden.” Following the no confidence vote last week, Lofven could have either called a snap election or resigned.
