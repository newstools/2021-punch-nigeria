Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested three suspected land grabbers at the Itusokun Quarters in the Odogbolu area of the state. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. Oyeyemi said the suspects, Wasiu Adenuga, Michael John and Moruf Alaba, were arrested following a report lodged at the Odogbolu Divisional Police Headquarters by one Kemi Olukoya. He added that Olukoya reported that while she was on her new site supervising construction workers, a group of eight men invaded the place, started shooting indiscriminately and chased away the workers. The PPRO said, “She (Olukoya) stated further that the hoodlums also snatched at gunpoint her bag containing the sum of N500,000 and her telephones valued at N40,000. “Upon the report, the DPO, Odogbolu Division, SP Adeniyi Awokunle, mobilised his men and moved to the scene, and on getting there, the hoodlums were seen escaping through the nearby bush, but they were chased after and one of them, Wasiu Adenuga, was apprehended. “Further combing of the bush led to the arrest of two others namely: Michael John and Moruf Alaba, while three Bajaj motorcycles that they used for the operation were also impounded. “The victim identified the three of them as members of the gang that attacked her and her workers.” The PPRO added that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation. Oyeyemi said Ajogun also directed that the remaining members of the gang be hunted and brought to justice. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
