Gunmen believed to be pirates have attacked a passenger speedboat and abducted four persons in Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the victims were travelling from Twon-Brass near the Atlantic Ocean to Yenagoa on Wednesday, when the pirates struck. The Chairman of the Maritime Workers’ Union, Brass Unit, Mr Daniel Biodomoye, confirmed the incident. He said the assailants attacked the speedboat and took the passengers away around midday. Biodomoye appealed to the Chairman of the Brass Local Government Council, Mr Victor Isaiah, to release the council’s refurbished gunboat to support the two others provided by the state government, which are currently patrolling the route. “I am also calling for stronger collaboration to secure the waterways and make them safe,” he said. The spokesman for the state police command, Mr Asinim Butswat, said he contacted the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the Brass area, who told him that no such incident had been reported. Thirteen persons were abducted in February when pirates attacked six passenger speedboats on the Okpoama-Odioma and Nembe-Brass waterways. The incident resulted in the suspension of activities by boat operators to protest against frequent attacks on the state’s  waterways. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
