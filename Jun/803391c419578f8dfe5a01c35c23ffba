Supporters of the All Progressives Congress under the aegis of the Progressives for Yari, have appealed to party supporters not to make the mistake of voting in an inexperienced member as National Chairman in the forthcoming national convention. Spokesman for the group, Mr. Jide Kehinde, said this during a press conference, in Abuja, on Sunday. He said the APC would require the experience of former Zamfara State Governor, Abdulaziz Yari, who was a one-time Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, to confront the challenges the party was certainly going to face in 2023. Kehinde said, “APC needs a National Chairman like Yari who can really bring people together for a victorious march towards 2023; it is of extreme significance when we have such personality who is very loyal to the APC in addition to having deep capacity to drive the manifesto of the party and work for it at all levels. ” The spokesman who was flanked by Umar Adamu and Emeka Nwafor-Ibe, who are also leaders of the group, further noted that it was time for party members especially those interested in vying for office to stop the campaign of calumny against one another. He noted that going into extremes to bring a fellow party member down in the quest for office was not only damaging to the person being maligned but that it was also a disservice to the party and all it stood for. Kahinde said, “Without any shade of doubt, Alhaji Yari has always had the populist touch and he has always canvassed the need for politicians to be ready to grant concessions and maintain party loyalty; no doubt, his closeness and accessibility to party members across the nation’s six geo-political zones stand him out already. “Unlike typical politicians who prefer desperate schemes, Alhaji Yari has always been keen for fence-mending compromises and reconciliation that will be of benefit to our party, APC at the state and national levels.”
