Russia have made three changes for their key Euro 2020 Group B game against Finland in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday as they aim to bounce back from losing 3-0 to Belgium in their opening match. Aleksei Miranchuk of Atalanta comes in along with centre-back Igor Diveev, with Andrei Semenov and veteran Yuri Zhirkov making way for them. In addition, Matvei Safonov replaces Anton Shunin in goal for Stanislav Cherchesov’s side. Russia will be staring at elimination with a defeat, while Finland are looking to make it two wins out of two in their first ever appearance at a major tournament. The only change to the side that beat Denmark 1-0 in Copenhagen sees Rasmus Schueller come in for captain Tim Sparv in midfield.
