The Human Capital Providers Association of Nigeria has urged job applicants to conduct background checks on job adverts, stating that there is an urgent need to sanitise the human resources industry. The Executive Secretary, Human Capital Providers Association of Nigeria, Olajide Afolabi, said this in an interview with our correspondent. “One of the major challenges we have is thousands of recruiters without registration or licence; we have those with expired licences, too. “If you don’t have a valid licence, legally you are not entitled to recruit. We are working with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment to monitor the activities of employers in Nigeria, not only the members of the HUCAPAN. Together with the ministry, we will prosecute agencies who are recruiting without legal backing. “We are sanitising the public on how you can get licensed recruiters, you can also get it from our website or Nigeria Exchange platform.” Afolabi stated that one of the guiding principles is that every employee must have a letter of appointment which must contain the appropriate working conditions. Afolabi said, “We have a code of conduct developed by HuCapan, NECA, and the Ministry of Labour that guides the activities of our members and promotes international labour standards and ethical practices in terms of recruitment, deployment and management of outsource personnel in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
