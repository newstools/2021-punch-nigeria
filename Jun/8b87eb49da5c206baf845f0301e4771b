Anthony Adeyinka, Senior Special Assistant on Sports to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has commended operatives of the Lagos State Police Command over their handling of the June 12 protest in the state. He spoke with The PUNCH Video crew at the Lekki Toll Plaza on Saturday morning. According to him, the police rose to the occasion to disperse hoodlums, who wanted to hijack the protest at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in the Ojota area in Lagos State. The PUNCH had earlier reported that policemen fired tear gas canisters and gunshots at the Ojota venue of the protest earlier on Saturday. When asked why the police fired tear gas at the Gani Fawehinmi Park, the governor’s aide said, “I was impressed with the way the police handled that situation, it was not the activists, it was the hoodlums that wanted to hijack that protest. “The people were at Ojota peacefully. The activists were addressing themselves that what they want is a peaceful demonstration but the hoodlums, the miscreants as we all know them wanted to hijack the peaceful demonstration but the police rose to that occasion and made sure the thing was put in order.” Adeyinka added, “The youths in Lagos are ready to work in synergy with the state government. The last thing that happened during the #EndSARS showed how hoodlums hijacked a proposed peaceful protest but we give thanks to God that the youths are able to come together and work together with the governor and make sure there is peace in the state.”
