Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, on Saturday said Nigerians have been overwhelmed with crises  and need to cry to God for a solution. Obasanjo said this during the 16th edition of the virtual Prayer Breakfast with Olusegun Obasanjo, Asiwaju Onigbagbo, Ogun state, organised by the Christians Association of Nigeria ,Ogun state chapter in his honour. He said, “We seem to have been overwhelmed with the crises in our land; that is why we are here. We have some challenges. These are beyond what we can handle. We have to cry to God.” Obasanjo also said both the government and the governed had been overwhelmed by the problems facing the country. He added, “Our land needs to be healed. We have been overwhelmed, those in the government, executive, legislators, public servant, civil servant, private sector, we are overwhelmed. “God cannot be overwhelmed. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, I believe God will heal our land; that is the reason we are here.’’ In his short sermon, the Archbishop of Lagos Ecclesiastical Province (Anglican Communion), Michael Fape, said Nigeria was in a very difficult time. Fape, who spoke on “God’s approved way for solution to the problem of Nigeria,” urged Nigerians to humble themselves and turn away from wicked ways. The cleric said, “We steal. We embezzle the resources that should be used for the public. Nigeria is in dire need of divine intervention. We should humble ourselves, repent from our sins and turn away from our wicked ways.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
