THE Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammed Babandede, on Monday in Katsina hinted about imminent changes and transfers in the service. He particularly mentioned those at land borders, declaring that some of the NIS personnel at the place had compromised their positions and were taking bribes. Babandede made the declaration while addressing the NIS personnel at the NIS Katsina Command headquarters during the commencement of his official visit to the command. He declared, “Some of you have been at your duty post for donkey years. That is why you collect bribes. You will be shifted. “If I touch you and you go and talk to a traditional ruler, you will only be getting yourself into traditional crisis. “If I touch you and you go and talk to an honorable member, it will only lead to your honourable dismissal, and if I touch you and you go and report to a distinguished senator, you will be distinguished out of service. I have issued out that directive.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
