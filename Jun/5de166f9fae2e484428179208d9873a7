Popular microblogging platform, Twitter, is set to introduce the ‘undo tweet’ option in its new subscription service known as Twitter Blue. This new service made its début in Canada and Australia on Thursday, CNN reported. As tweeps had always clamoured for an ‘edit’ button, Twitter is offering a similar option known as the ‘undo tweet’ button. With the ‘undo tweet’ option, users can be allowed to preview a tweet before actually posting it. A timer can be set for up to 30 seconds before posting, in case users may have to correct or rethink their tweets. The ‘undo tweet’ option comes with the new subscription, Twitter Blue, which attracts a monthly fee of $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD. Twitter’s basic service will continue to be free but the monthly charge will be paid by users who want to access special features on Twitter Blue. Asides from the ‘undo tweet’ option, another feature is the ability for the users to change the look inside the app, including the colour of the Twitter app icon. Other features include bookmark folders and reader mode. While bookmark folders help users to save their tweets in an organised way, reader mode converts long Twitter threads into consolidated text for easier reading.
