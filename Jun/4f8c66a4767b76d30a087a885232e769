A female police officer was on Thursday shot dead around the Orji flyover in Owerri, the Imo State capital. Another person, whose identity had yet to be established, was also shot dead in the area. The shootings were carried out by hoodlums who came from the Amakohia end of the Orji flyover. Residents of the area told our correspondent that the gunmen operated in a bus and Hilux as they operated unchallenged. The development caused panic in the area, as motorists deserted the ever- busy Owerri- Okigwe Road. A source told our correspondent that the female police victim hailed form the Ngor Okpala Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent gathered that the gun-wielding hoodlums came with the female officer. She was said to have been kidnapped by the gunmen the day the Orji Police Division was attacked. A source said, “They came with the female police officer, who was kidnapped the day Orji Police Station was attacked. They dropped a message that they would only free her if their member in police custody was released. Having waited without their demand being met, the hoodlums came with the cop, brought her out and shot her dead.” Our correspondent learnt that the attackers wore fake military fatigues and were masked. The state police spokesperson, Bala Elkana, said he had not been briefed on the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
