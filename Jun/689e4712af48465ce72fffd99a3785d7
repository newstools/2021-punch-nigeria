Some members of the All Progressives Congress in the Epe Local Government Area, as well as the Ikosi Ejirin and Eredo local council development areas of Lagos State have lamented injustice during the party primary elections in the division. The residents also claimed that candidates were imposed on them for the forthcoming local government elections in the state. They appealed to the leaders of the APC in the state to remove the imposed candidates. A member in the Ikosi-Ejirin LCDA, Lateef Sunday, said the primary election was disrupted on May 29, 2021. “At the end, we just saw a list with the names of some persons as chairmanship and vice chairmanship candidates for the party when the primary did not hold. “First term chairmen in various local governments in Lagos State were allowed to return and the chairmen in the LGA and LCDAs in Epe have served for a term and performed well, so they ought to have been returned.” Another member from the Eredo LCDA, Bosun Adigun, alleged that the chairmen were denied tickets based on the “unfounded belief that they are loyalists of a particular politician.” When contacted, the state APC Chairman, Babatunde Balogun, said most chairmen that did well were allowed to go for second term, adding that it was not automatic. He added, “There is no imposition, we had elections in all the local government areas in Lagos State. A lot of people turned out for the elections in Epe and other councils. We have an election appeal committee; I am attending to the committee regarding some of the issues they came up with.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
