We want to assure you that nothing will stop the work of God at SCOAN from moving on. Prophet TB Joshua may be absent in the body but he is present in the spirit. “We are currently preparing for a week-long service from Monday 5th to Sunday 11th July 2021 in honour of Prophet TB Joshua’s life and legacy. “He will be laid to rest at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria. “All services will be broadcast live on Emmanuel TV.
