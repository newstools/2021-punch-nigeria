Multiple award-winning Nigerian singer, Davido, has taken to his verified Twitter account with over nine million followers to state that God will expose any “wickedness” around him. In his tweet, the iconic singer wrote, “God will expose and deal with any wickedness around me; near or far, Amen. I’m blessed.” His tweet comes shortly after a video snippet surfaced online where a cleric claimed that he had a revelation the pop star would be poisoned by someone living under his roof. “I told you about one singer, Davido. They will poison him; I don’t know him and I have never seen him in my life. They will put something in his drink; he will be rushed to the hospital, will be admitted, and unconscious. The person that will poison him is sleeping in his house,” the cleric said. More so, the singer’s former personal assistant, Aloma, in a recent interview, revealed that in 2017, he was offered N100m by someone in the music industry to implicate Davido in the death of his friend, Tagbo. Aloma said, “When we were at the Police station, Lion Building, they took me to a room and said that I am a ‘fall man’. Beware of this music industry, everyone is trying their best to pull David down. “They told me to write a statement which will state that David killed Tagbo. They gave me a cheque of N100m just for me to write that David killed Tagbo.”
