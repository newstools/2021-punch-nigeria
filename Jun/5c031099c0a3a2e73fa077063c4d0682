The Nigerian Institute Of Journalism has postponed a forum which was supposed to feature Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, as a speaker, The PUNCH has learnt. The school had in an advertisement, announced Shehu as a speaker at the forum slated for Thursday afternoon at the NIJ Campus in the Ogba area of Lagos State. The presidential aide was supposed to speak on the topic, ‘Fake News: Challenges Of Information Management’. However, NIJ Management in a statement on Thursday morning titled, ‘NIJ Professional Forum Postponed’, said, “This is to inform all members of the public that the NIJ Professional Forum scheduled to hold today, June 10, 2021 has been postponed. “A new date will be announced later. All inconveniences caused by this postponement are highly regretted. Thank you.” Speaking with The PUNCH, a source in the school who craved anonymity because he was not officially permitted to speak on the matter, said the management, as of Wednesday evening, had no plan to postpone the forum. The source said Shehu was also prepared to attend the event but the school management made a last-minute U-turn on Thursday morning, a few hours to the commencement of the programme by 1pm. The source noted that the ban of social media platform Twitter and the controversy around it in the country at the moment was part of the reasons the school management took the decision. He added that the security situation of the area was also put into consideration as many people who are miffed with the presidential spokesman planned to attend the event to confront him.
