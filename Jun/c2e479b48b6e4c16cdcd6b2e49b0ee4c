English Premier League champions Manchester City have joined a host of other top European clubs in the race to sign Almeria €30m rated striker, Sadiq Umar, ahead of the 2021/22 season. The 24-year-old had an impressive 2020/21 season and finished Almeria’s highest goal scorer after he bagged 28 goals with nine assists in 56 games across all competitions. He also finished as the Spanish second-tier league’s third highest goal scorer with 20 goals, behind Espanyol’s Raul De Tomás (23) and Uros Djurdjevic of Sporting (22). According to Spanish website, AS, City are the latest club to have submitted an offer for the Nigerian, after offers had already been submitted from other clubs like Spartak Moscow and Eintracht Frankfurt, with Sevilla and Villarreal also reportedly interested, as pointed out by Diario de Almería. The English plan would be to loan Sadiq to ESTAC Troyes, who were recently promoted to the French Ligue 1. “Sources close to the club confirmed the interest of the Citizens in the 24-year-old Nigerian forward, who would be loaned to ESTAC Troyes from Ligue 1,” AS wrote on their website. “However, Almería continues to refer to the price of €30m to get rid of the Kaduna tip. With a contract until 2025 and a clause of €60m, the group chaired by Turki Al-Sheikh will not let one of its highest market values escape so easily. However, his departure seems evident in a summer that, yes, will be long in the Almeria offices.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
