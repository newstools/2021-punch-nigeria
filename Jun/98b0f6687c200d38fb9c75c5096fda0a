The Lagos State Government says it has embarked on an advocacy to encourage proper plastic waste disposal to reduce environmental pollution. It added that through its creation of waste-to-wealth initiatives, residents would get paid in exchange for recyclable waste, thereby reducing the impact of climate change on the state. The General Manager of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, Dr Dolapo Fasawe, expressed this on Friday during a sensitisation walk to mark the 2021 World Environment Day, in collaboration with the Cleaning Practitioners Association of Nigeria. She said, “Waste-to-wealth is a sustainable international initiative that is recognised worldwide with the objective of generating less waste, encouraging reusable materials, as well as promoting recycling and conversion of waste to new products which translates into income generation and job opportunities for our people.” Fasawe said the cash-for-trash transfer will reduce the indiscriminate dumping of plastics in drains and water channels and would prevent the pollution of food and drinking water. “To garner support for our campaign, we made our offer attractive and paid higher than market values to promote plastic recovery and attitudinal change,” she added.
