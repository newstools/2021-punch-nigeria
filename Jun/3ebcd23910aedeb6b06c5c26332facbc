The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, on Friday, threatened that the police in any part of the country will be ruthless with criminals across the country. Baba said this while speaking in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital shortly before taking delivery of security vehicles and equipment donated to the police by the state government. The equipment handed over to IGP Baba by Governor Dapo Abiodun includes over 55 patrol vehicles, motorcycles, 200 bulletproofs, 20 helmets, and communication equipment. In his remarks, the Police boss noted that the equipment will upscale operations of the security agents in the fight against insecurity in the state. Baba maintained that the law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear, stressing that the security operatives would deal with the trouble makers ruthlessly. The IGP who branded Abiodun a “security conscious governor,” said the donation would go a long way in ensuring the security of lives and property in the state. Baba said, “Security is everybody’s business; we appreciate you for making our jobs easier by giving us tools to work with. No security outfit in the world can succeed without mobility and communication gadgets. The body armour will give personnel the courage to confront crimes. “This will go a long way in ensuring the security of lives and property in Ogun State. “I want to assure that we will be ruthless on those posing a serious security threat to the peaceful coexistence in the country.” While handing over the equipment, Abiodun also declared that his government will smoke out criminals and prosecute them to serve as a deterrent to others. He said the government views criminality as an act of sabotage “against our collective responsibility.” “We will find you, we will smoke you out, we will arrest you and you will face the fullest extent of the law,” Abiodun warned criminals in the state.
