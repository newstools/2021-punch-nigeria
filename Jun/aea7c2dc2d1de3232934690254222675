A former Presidential Adviser on National Assembly matters and the Ambassador of industrialisation in Cross River State, Senator Florence Ita-Giwa, has called on the Federal Government and other bodies to support the industrialisation drive in the state under the leadership of Governor Ben Ayade. Ita-Giva said this on Monday in a statement, calling on local and international stakeholders to support Ayade’s industrial projects to enable the state to occupy a more vantage position economically. The statement reads in part, “As the ambassador of industrialisation in Cross River state, I am calling on the Federal Government and other stakeholders both locally and internationally to support Governor Ben Ayade in this industrialisation drive. The projects are massive and are in virtually all the local government areas.” Ita-Giwa lauded Ayade for attracting industrialists and business moguls, a move that she said would lay the groundwork for “massive support” the state would get. “The vision of the governor is so clear and when fully established, Cross River would be the number one state in Nigeria because the governor is already setting the pace of development despite the lean resources that comes to him monthly.” Copyright PUNCH.
