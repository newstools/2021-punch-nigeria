A non-governmental organisation, Spaces for Change, has urged the Imo State Government to implement the recommendations of the state Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Police Brutality set up to investigate cases of police brutality. The organisation, in a statement by its Communications Officer, Olusola Oluwafemi, demanded that the state government expedite the implementation of the commission’s findings and recommendations. Oluwafemi said, “S4C welcomes the news regarding the conclusion of proceedings of the Imo State Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Police Brutality and Related Extrajudicial Killings and the recent submission of the commission’s findings and recommendations to the Imo State Government. “We strongly urge the Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, to implement the commission’s recommendations. That is the only way to secure justice for victims of police brutality and extrajudicial killings in the state and restore citizens’ confidence in the security apparatus and institutions of state. “We specifically demand the prosecution of all security personnel indicted in the report. We further urge the Imo State Government to immediately commence the disbursement of the sum of N770,985,800 to the victims as recommended.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
