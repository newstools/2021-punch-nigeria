The Senator representing Niger North Senatorial District, Niger State, in the National Assembly, Sabi Abdullahi, on Tuesday, raised the alarm over the growing number of persons displaced by the activities of bandits in his constituency. He said no fewer than 50,000 Internally Displaced Persons were in Kontagora and Rigali towns. A statement on Tuesday said Abdullahi spoke while coming under Order 43 of the Senate Rules during plenary. He was said to have lamented the spate of attacks by armed bandits in Niger State, especially in the Rafi Local Government Area in Niger East; Kontagora, Manga Rijau, Magama, Mashagu and Wushishi LGAs. He said, “Mr. President, as we speak, I have confirmed reports that bandits have attacked Kamnani Bobbi and are in and around Mai Goge village, all on Tagira-Kontagora Road. “Earlier, yesterday, they attacked Beri town, where they killed over eight persons, with many seriously injured. “Aside these attacks, there are over 50,000 IDPs in Kontagora and Rijau towns.” The lawmaker, therefore, urged the National Emergency Management Agency to provide relief materials to people displaced by bandits. ”Copyright PUNCH.
