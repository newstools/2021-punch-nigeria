THE Rivers State House of Assembly has approved the regulation on the prohibition of use of private consultants, agents to collect personal income tax in the state. Recall that the State Governor, Nyesom Wike, had sent the bill aimed at ensuring transparency, fast track development and accountability in the state to the lawmakers. Debating on the bill titled, ‘Rivers State regulation for the prohibition of private consultants/agents for the assessment and collection of personal income tax, 2021’, the lawmakers agreed that the bill would entrench accountability. The House Leader and member representing Obio Akpor Constituency 1, Martin Amaehule, said the regulation was in pursuant to Section 75 of the state Board of Internal Revenue, Service Law No. 12, 2012, and contains seven clauses. “The key thing in this regulation is that the state board of revenue service no longer wants consultants to be part of the job of collecting personal income tax for the state government. “The state revenue board wants to collect personal income tax and channel it properly as the existing law provided,” he stated. In his remarks, the Speaker, Ikunyi Owaji-Ibani, described the move as good for democracy and a state “whose leader is passionate about development”. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
