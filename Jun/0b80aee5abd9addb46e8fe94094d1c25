The Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Owerri, Imo State, Most Rev Anthony Obinna, has charged Governor Hope Uzodinma to stop the incessant killings in the state. Obinna stated this on Friday in a broadcast on Ozisa 91FM, an Owerri archdiocesan radio station, saying the charge was provoked by threats and acts of violence by suspected Fulani herdsmen and other criminals in the state. He noted that people were living in fear. Obinna said, “On June 3, I visited the Owerri Federal Medical Centre mortuary and saw over 35 corpses stark naked on bare floor dumped there within the last few days. They were victims of runaway killers, military, police, and unknown gunmen with no identities on them. “I thought of many others who have been kidnapped and butchered as we continue to hear that Imo is bleeding. On behalf of the killed and even more on behalf of all the living now threatened daily, I charge the governor, as the Chief Security Officer, to step up and stop the killings by whoever is responsible for them.” Copyright PUNCH.
