Eighteen schools in Lagos are vying for honours at the 2021 PwCChess4Change Grand Slam, which began on Tuesday at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos. The three-day tourney ends on Thursday. The schools, according to MediaVision Limited, organisers of the tournament, were drawn across four educational districts in the state. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Segun Omodunni, who represented the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Education, congratulated the students in this edition, all of whom had undergone a three-month intensive chess tutelage and mini-challenge competitions that served as qualifiers. “PwCChess4Change was introduced to Lagos State schools by MediaVission in 2014 with just six schools in the pilot edition, but now 18 schools. “It is noteworthy to mention that the objectives of the programme are gradually being achieved. These include among others, improvement of strategic and critical thinking skill amongst students in Lagos State. Our students have been benefiting by participating in the game and it has enhanced their thinking ability, as well as promote their academic excellence as they prepare strategically.” Copyright PUNCH.
