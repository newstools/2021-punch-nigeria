International Forex broker, OctaFX has launched a socially conscious marketing campaign called Dual Life aimed at simplifying forex trading and helping Nigerians create wealth. A statement by the organisation on Monday said that the marketing campaign would celebrate the super powers of Nigerians who commited their time and efforts to two or more jobs, and were successful at each one of them. It stated that the #DualLifewithOctaFX campaign had influencers in the Nigerian lifestyle and entertainment space such as Toke Makinwa, Bovi, Denola Grey, Timini Egbuson, and others  at the core of the engagements, establishing  the other sides of the celebrities and influencers as entrepreneurs. While speaking about the campaign, the Marketing Manager, EMEA, OctaFX,Ali Nwadike said, “We wanted to position forex trading as that activity young Nigerians and everyone else, can engage in, even while focusing on their careers. “From findings, most young Nigerians today work two or more jobs to pay the bills and attain financial freedom. But, we don’t get to talk about this often or appreciate the efforts, hence the #DualLifewithOctaFX campaign. “While some see their jobs as a burden, we want people to see it as an achievement; and promote the school of thought that says one, two, many jobs is not bad especially when you are trying to create wealth.” Nwadike added that more Nigerians would be exposed to the beauty of keeping their regular jobs and careers while making more money from forex trading with the OctaFX Trading App. The statement said OctaFX had made necessary arrangements from assembling forex experts and compiling training guides in the simplest and relatable form.
