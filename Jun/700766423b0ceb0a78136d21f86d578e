The publisher of an Ogun State community newspaper, Prestige Newspaper, Dada Olanipekun, has said he wrote a book about 50 prominent persons in the state to encourage younger ones to emulate them. The publisher said this in the book, ‘Ogun State 50 top role models: Memoirs,’ showed that Ogun State was blessed with great men and women who needed to be celebrated considering their impact in all human endeavours. He said, “In a country where role models are increasingly in decline, Ogun State stands tallest with cascading role models in virtually all sectors that drive a state.” Speaking on the book, he noted that one could identify many men of integrity from Ogun State who served as icons to both young and old everywhere. “When you take a look at the likes of Simeon Adebo, Wole Soyinka and Obafemi Awolowo; these are the people who informed the general public that integrity pays. If you build integrity like they built theirs, you will go places,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
