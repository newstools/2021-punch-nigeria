Total Grace Oil & Gas has inaugurated a new filling station in the Lekki area of Lagos. The event had celebrities Funke Akindele, Oluseye Damola popularly known as DJ Spinall, and others in attendance. According to a statement issued by the company, the Executive Chairman, Total Grace Oil & Gas, Dr Henry Akinduro, said the station was built with the innovation of the electrical charging point. He noted that it was the first filling station to have such in Nigeria and that it was built in a bid to ensure that Nigerians enjoyed the best products and services. Akinduro said the station was built on the principle of faithfulness in terms of measurement. He was quoted to have said, “This is the only filling station in Nigeria that has an electrical charging point. “Here, we are more friendly, unlike other people. Every month end, we give out gifts. Also, we are trying to bring innovation into the industry. We believe we can sell at a reasonable price and still turn a profit.” He added, “This is our first filling station in Lagos. We have in Ibadan and other states. We discovered that there is no faithfulness in terms of measurement in Lagos specifically. “We have decided to make sure that our one litre is one litre. So, that is why it is different from other filling stations in Nigeria.” According to him, the company chose the location because development is moving there. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
