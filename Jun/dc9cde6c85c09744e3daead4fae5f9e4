A former Ekiti State Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Chief Jide Awe, has said that the ghost of the primaries conducted for the 2018 governorship election, which produced Dr Kayode Fayemi, as a candidate, was still haunting the party. Awe, who also said the APC mismanaged itself both at the state and national levels, advised that the party primary for the 2022 governorship election should be transparent. The APC leader said this in an interview with journalists in Ado Ekiti, late on Monday. He said, “The APC as it is, is in a ‘party less’ situation. A party that has no executive is directionless.” He took a swipe at some APC members who were in government. He said, “The present situation is not expected of us. We are not measuring up to standard and party members are complaining. “When members are complaining and those at the helm of affairs are behaving as if they are angels and operating within an iron cast habitat, when they are not relating well with members, that is causing a lot of problems within our party. That may be some of the problems we are going to encounter soon as we go into the election year”. Awe, who harped on the need for Ekiti APC to opt for acceptable primaries and jettison the idea of ‘winner takes it all’, said, “Up till now, the ghost of the primary which was conducted in 2018 governorship is what we are still battling with. “Despite APC being in government in the state, many of our people don’t see themselves as being part of the party, much more being part of the government. That was what led to the hues and cries after the executive. “I think some of what we are seeing has resonated in the nation which led to the total dissolution of the National Executive Committee of the party. In our party constitution, there is no room for a caretaker, so there is an urgent need for congresses.”
