Smile Communications has launched a new eSIM for voice and messaging communication on its SmileVoice app. The company disclosed this in a statement issued on Sunday. According to the company, the new eSIM comes at a price of N500. The Chief Marketing Officer of Smile Communications, Abdul Hafeez, said the relaunch was aimed at empowering Smile’s existing and prospective customers with a product extension that is derived from an existing product with incentives. He said, “To maximise the new eSIM service, once a customer joins Smile, their eSIM service is activated. Just download the free SmileVoice app on a compatible smartphone, running an Android or iOS system, through the respective App stores. “Once the download is successful, a customer will be required to activate the service on their device. “Once activated, the device needs to be connected to wireless or mobile Internet for the customer to launch the dialler on the app and initiate a call like a regular call to use the service.” The CMO noted that unlike the regular SIM card that needed to be inserted in the smartphone and only functioned wherever the mobile network was available, the eSIM could be used anywhere in the world. Existing Smile customers are required to activate the free SmileVoice App on their smartphones connected through Wi-Fi or mobile data. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
