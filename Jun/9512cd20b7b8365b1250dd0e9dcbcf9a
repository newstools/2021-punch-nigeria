A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and ex-presidential candidate, Kingsley Moghalu, has declared his intention to run for Nigerian Presidency again in the 2023 general elections. Moghalu was a presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party in 2019. He had ran alongside Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) of the All Progressives Congress, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, and others. Moghalu made his intention to run again known in a statement which partly read, “2023: I will run because the people matter. “There is no hope out of our troubles until Nigeria faces the leadership question and looks for capacity, competence, and a compassionate heart for the suffering poor.” Moghalu also reaffirmed his ambition to run for Presidency, stating that an inclusive national leadership and constitutional restructuring can curb the ongoing violence in the country. He said,”What is the value of a Nigerian life? “We live daily in the shadow of terrorists. The economy is collapsing. Many families cannot afford the price of food. “Only the emergence of a visionary, competent, and inclusive national leadership on the one hand, and the fundamental constitutional restructuring of Nigeria on the other, can arrest Nigeria’s ongoing and violent disintegration into a completely failed state. “For the sake of the youths of our country, I intend, with all humility, to present myself again to Nigerians as a candidate for the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.”
