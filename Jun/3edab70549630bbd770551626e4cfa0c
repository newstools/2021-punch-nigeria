CWG Plc is targeting new revenue streams this year as its profit after tax for the financial year 2020 rose by 507 per cent to N443m. The Chairman, Phillip Obioha, said the company maintained a solid ﬁnancial performance last year while navigating through the challenging times occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said at the company’s annual general meeting on Thursday that the performance was primarily driven by the well-diversiﬁed revenue base, efficient operating cost management, and superior technological offering to its customers. He said CWG ended with a net revenue of N11.7bn in 2020, 22 per cent higher than the prior year’s income, and a gross proﬁt of N2.6bn as against N2.3bn in 2019. “The improved revenue and gross proﬁt were due to the gains from the decision we took in 2019 to re-invest in some of our platforms and subscription business,” Obioha said. He said CWG had continued to progress in growing its platform, subscription and software service business arm. He said the company signed on new strategic partners to deliver digital solutions that enhance our customers’ operations. He said, “Our Uniﬁed Cooperative Platform has continued to witness an increase in transaction volume. We signed on the cooperative society of two multinational companies in the year, thus showing the customers’ conﬁdence in our platforms. “In 2021, we expect to partner with other multi-national company’s cooperative societies. These partnerships will guarantee new revenue streams in 2021 and beyond.” Obioha said the company had been positioned to take advantage of the emerging opportunities within the technology space and remain optimistic about delivering its objectives in 2021.
