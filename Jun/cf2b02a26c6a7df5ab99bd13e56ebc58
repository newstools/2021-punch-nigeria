THE Rivers State Waste Management Agency has read the riot act to traders, saying any of them caught dumping refuse on the median will be arrested and prosecuted. The agency’s Sole Administrator, Felix Obuah, stated this during a meeting with service providers in Port Harcourt, last Saturday. Also, Obuah gave a 48-hour ultimatum to service providers in the state to get to work and clear filth in Port Harcourt and its environs or “have their contracts terminated”. He charged all service providers to ensure that their zones/areas were kept clean within 48 hours from Monday, June 14, 2021, and at all times. He said, “Despite persistent cautions and warnings from the agency to members of the public about the environmental laws of the state on indiscriminate dumping of refuse, some persons have formed the habit of indiscriminately dumping refuse on the median and outside government-approved dumping hours of 6pm to 12 midnight, daily.” Obuah said from reports, some wastes noticed in some parts of Port Harcourt and its environs after service providers had finished working were generated by traders in the name of market sanitation. He therefore placed a ban on dumping of wastes indiscriminately outside government-approved hours of 6pm to 12 midnight by traders in the state in the name of cleaning up the markets.
