Phil Foden was picked to start for England in their Euro 2020 opener against Croatia at Wembley on Sunday, with Kieran Trippier surprisingly selected at left-back. Manchester City pair Raheem Sterling and Foden will play behind captain Harry Kane in the Group D fixture — a re-match of the 2018 semi-final in Russia, which Croatia won 2-1. Manager Gareth Southgate turned to Atletico Madrid’s title-winning right-back Trippier to play on the left of the back four, with Luke Shaw on the bench and Ben Chilwell absent from the matchday squad. Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic and Ante Rebic all feature as Croatia boss Zlatko Dalic named six of the side that started the 2018 World Cup final in Russia.
