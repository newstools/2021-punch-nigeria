My first thought was ‘who is she?’ I did the girly thing…slide into your page and watched your beautiful life. “I took a stroll to your DM and I fell in love with you immediately. You tried to reach out as a support and pillar in my trying times. You were one of the only people who tried to help me and you did not even know me. “In your honour last year, I gave seven women IVF treatment to celebrate you in private. I am grateful for the love you wanted to give me. Keep resting in peace ma’am.”
