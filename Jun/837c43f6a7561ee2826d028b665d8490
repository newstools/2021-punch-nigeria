THE Kwara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has disagreed with the All Progressives Congress over the performance of the Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq-led administration. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Second anniversary: Gov. Abdulrazaq has nothing tangible to showcase,’ which was signed by the State PDP Chairman, Kola Shitu, in Ilorin, on Monday. The PDP said, “It is impossible to find anyone on the streets of Kwara state who has a word of praise for Governor Abdulrazaq’s performance in office except his cronies and bootlickers. “Governor Abdulrazaq has failed woefully on many fronts of governance. There is no significant accomplishment or achievement the governor and his handlers can showcase to Kwarans. “We challenge the Governor to point at any landmark project it initiated and completed in any part of the state since he assumed office two years ago.” In response, the State Government in a statement titled: ‘PDP’s assessment of governor Abdulrahman: An insult to the masses’ integrity,’ signed by the governors Special Adviser on Political Communication, Alhaji Bashir Adigun, described the statement as a ‘futile attempt of a frustrated and rejected PDP to assess the outstanding two-year performance of our exemplary Governor, Mallam AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq.’ “It is ridiculous that a party that was sacked in an overwhelming landslide election in Kwara State in the 2019 General Elections would have the temerity to give an assessment of a Governor that has already been rated the best in the history of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
