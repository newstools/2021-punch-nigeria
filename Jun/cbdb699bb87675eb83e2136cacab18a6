The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said only competent people will be appointed to help realise the government’s vision of making Edo great again. In a statement on Sunday, he said that his administration was adopting a bottom-to-top approach in appointing persons to occupy political positions. Obaseki said this recently while speaking with leaders of Peoples Democratic Party in Edo North Senatorial District. He stated that youths and women would be prioritised in the appointments, and charged leaders from the six local government areas of Edo North Senatorial District to present the best nominees to be appointed from their wards. The governor also said that every ward in each of the six local government areas would be represented in his administration, adding that power belonged to the people, and the power must start from the grassroots, particularly the ward level. He said, “Every ward will be represented in my government. I will get Special Assistants from each ward across the six local government areas. Leaders must sit down to nominate qualified and the best people that will represent them well in government.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
