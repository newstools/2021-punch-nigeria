THE Federal Government has commenced the bidding process for the sale of recovered and forfeited assets from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and the Inter-ministerial Committee set up by the government to handle sales of the assets under the Ministry of Justice opened the bid for the sales of the assets in Abuja on Thursday. This was disclosed in a statement issued by the National Association of Auctioneers on Thursday. The National President of the association, Aliyu Kiliya, expressed his satisfaction with the manner in which the opening of the bid was conducted. Kiliya also urged the committee to uphold uprightness in the process of selling the assets. He said, “All the procedures for Bureau for Public Prosecution and the Stores Regulation should be followed to the latter. The committee should do a diligent job not to allow any space for litigation in future as the items involved are very sensitive. “Knowledgeable persons should handle the sales which involved items not only in Nigeria but overseas, so as not to put all the efforts in disrepute.” In his remarks, the association’s General Secretary, Isibor Abhulimen, pointed out that the process of recruitment of professionals was key in conducting sales which involved huge sums of money.
