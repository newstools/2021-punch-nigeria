A former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, has disagreed with 12 governorship aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party over zoning of the party’s candidate in the South Senatorial District of the state. In a statement, Ezeife said any eligible person from the state could participate in the poll irrespective of their district. He described a communiqué by 12 PDP aspirants from Anambra South Senatorial District, stating that only those from the zone could participate in the poll, as one made in bad faith. He said, “I am in possession of a communiqué signed by 12 PDP Aspirants who are of southern origin. They based their communiqué on the provisions of PDP Constitution, Article 7,  They made special appeal to PDP about zoning. This is very good. I am an apostle of zoning too even though PDP in their wisdom decided not to zone the governorship seat in Anambra State. “However, I did not see the name of my daughter, distinguished Senator Uche Ekwunife, on the list of those who signed the communiqué, or have the signatories began a discriminatory process against her? Uche Ekwunife is from Igbo-Ukwu in the Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra South Senatorial District. “I believe that Uche Ekwunife has the constitutional rights as any Anambrarian to vie for the position of governor, either from Central or South Senatorial District. It’s her right, I strongly believe.” But 12 governorship aspirants, led by a United States of American Professor of Pain Management, Godwin Maduka, had said without zoning to position to the South District, PDP would lose the November poll.
