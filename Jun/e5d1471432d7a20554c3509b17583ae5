Gunmen struck at a farmstead at Iyemero Ekiti in the Ikole Council area of Ekiti State on Friday night and abducted a farmer, Jimoh Olodan. Sources said the gunmen, numbering about 18, invaded the farm settlement where the farmer and his household were, shooting sporadically and in the process, took Olodan away. A source, who witnessed the incident, said, “We were about going in to sleep at about 11pm on Friday night when we heard gunshots. But before we knew what was happening, they appeared. “When they saw Alhaji (Olodan), they took him away. They initially wanted to take away one of his two wives along with him, but on second thought, they freed the woman and left with Alhaji. They did not come with any vehicle.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, Sunday Abutu, who confirmed the incident, said police operatives had been drafted to the area to ensure the safe return of the farmer. Abutu said, “The police got the report this (Saturday) afternoon and our operatives have been detailed there to get facts on it and immediate action. We heard it happened late on Friday.” The Corps Commander, Ekiti State Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe, said, “Operatives of Amotekun are working in collaboration with the police to get to the root, ensure the man is freed and as well arrest of the suspects”.
