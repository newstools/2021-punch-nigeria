THE Special Adviser to Borno State Governor on House of Assembly Matters, Adamu Teli, has said there is no local government headquarters in Borno State that is under lock and key under the current administration of Prof. Babagana Zulum. Teli, while speaking to newsmen in Kaduna on Sunday on the state of security in the state, noted that prior to the coming of Prof. Zulum, three or four councils of the state were not secured from Boko Haram insurgents. According to the governor’s aide, with the coming of his principal, all the headquarters of the 27 local government areas of the state are occupied. He added that Maiduguri, the state capital, was enjoying peace as before the coming of Zulum, hardly a day passed would someone not hear the sounds of gunshots, bombs in and around the capital. He maintained that all these challenges had become a thing of the past, noting that “we are not saying we have achieved peace, but the governor has magnanimously reduced it. “This wouldn’t have been possible without the pragmatic approach of the governor who sacrificed his life at the detriment of the citizenry. “Of course without the support of the Federal Government and the security agencies, this wouldn’t have been possible. Also, the Civilian Joint Task Force and the ordinary people are in the vanguard of joining these forces to bring peace. “In terms of percentage, we have attained 60 to 70 per cent. We are making progress, but our opposition is fueling the crisis and make it as if the state is boiling every day.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
