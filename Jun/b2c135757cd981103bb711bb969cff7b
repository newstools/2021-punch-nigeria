A total of 532 civil servants in Plateau State face sacking  after they were discovered to have falsified their ages and records. The state governor, Simon Lalong, said this onTuesday during a policy retreat for permanent secretaries at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, NIPSS, Kuru. He added that government had already removed the names of the affected workers from its payroll. Lalong said, “I am aware of the huge manpower gaps that exist in the Plateau State civil service. With the setting up of the Nde John Gobak Committee on the Verification and Audit of Staff Strength, we will address these issues once the committee submits its report. Already, about 532 names have been removed from government payroll after sing the BVN system revealed inconsistencies in their records. Some had falsified their ages or tampered with their records. Others could not appear to answer queries on such records.” Lalong told the permanent secretaries that the state was facing continuous decline in revenues from FAAC which made it necessary to generate more revenue internally to meet the yearnings of the people. This, he said, necessitated  priority spending on areas that will yield revenues in all MDAs, as well as the blocking of leakages in the system. ”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
