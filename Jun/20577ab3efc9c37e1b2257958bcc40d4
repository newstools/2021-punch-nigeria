Leadway Assurance Company Limited says it has partnered with the Association of Parents of Private School Students to launch an education insurance policy plan, tagged ‘Group Education Protection Plan’. In said this in a statement on Sunday titled ‘Leadway Assurance partners parents association for bespoke education plan’. The statement said the education plan was launched at a Children’s Day event in Port Harcourt. It stated that it was designed to help parents protect their children’s future from possible socio-economic disruption in schooling due to unplanned or unforeseen events, such as the death of a parent or guardian, life-threatening critical illness, total and permanent disability resulting from personal accidents. “With this partnership, the parents are guaranteed the fulfilment of bequeathing their children quality and life-defining education, no matter what life throws at them,” it stated. The statement said the alliance mandated Leadway Assurance to assume the payment of the children’s fees for the agreed remaining school terms from the point the sponsoring parent or guardian died or contracts a critical illness or disability. Speaking on the initiative, the Head of Life Retail, Leadway Assurance, Bolorunduro Saliu, said, “This policy reflects the organisation’s proactive steps towards mitigating the risk parents face of failing to achieve their dream of bequeathing quality education to their children due to circumstances that are beyond their control, especially death or permanent disability.
