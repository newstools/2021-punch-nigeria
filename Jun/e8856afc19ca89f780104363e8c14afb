The Lagos State Federal High Court, Ikoyi, has discharged Senator Peter Nwaoboshi of the N322m money laundering charge filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Nwaoboshi represents Delta North Senatorial District in the National Assembly. In the two-count charge marked FHC/L/117C/18, the EFCC alleged that the defendants committed the offence of money laundering between May and June 2014, in Lagos. However, Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, who presided over the matter, held that the agency failed to prove the elements of the offences for which it charged the lawmaker. Justice Aneke further held, thus, “The prosecution’s case collapsed because bank officials were not called to testify.” Senator Nwaoboshi was thereafter cleared of all charges.
