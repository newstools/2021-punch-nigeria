The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday said his administration had been working to deliver transport infrastructure that supports the state economy. The governor stated this as he inaugurated a bus terminal in the Yaba area of the state. Sanwo-Olu said, “Yaba corridor is a prominent feature in the Lagos State transportation master plan because of its peculiar nature as a melting pot of commercial, technological and academic activities.” He explained that the terminal, built by the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority, would be complemented by the construction of the Red Line by the Lagos Rail Mass Transit, appealing to the members of the public to protect public infrastructure from vandals. “The facility being inaugurated today is a world-class terminal from which buses will originate and terminate. In the next 18 months, this bus terminal will be integrated with the Yaba Station of the Red Metro Line that is being constructed close to the terminal. The Yaba bus terminal reflects our vision for regulated bus services, which the state government currently champions through traffic management and transportation pillar of our T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. “All projects delivered by the government are for public good. It is our collective responsibility to protect these assets. It is our civic duty to report destruction of public infrastructure to the security agencies,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
