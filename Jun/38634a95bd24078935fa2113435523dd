THE 19 northern states Commissioners for Education brainstormed on Saturday in Kano on how to improve student exchange programmes, alongside other challenges, threatening the development of the sector. The Kano State Commissioner for Education, Alhaji Mohammad Kiru, said the meeting became necessary, so as to address the challenges facing the student exchange programme. According to him, Kano has two functional unity schools; Karaye for boys and Government College, Kachako for girls, adding that 400 students from the 19 northern states were currently studying at the schools. Kiru also listed other issues to be discussed during the meeting to include the security of boarding secondary schools, especially with the current security challenges confronting secondary schools in many parts of the country. In his remarks, the Chairman of the Students Exchange programme, who also doubles, as the Commissioner for Education, Kaduna State, Alhaji Shehu Mohammad, disclosed that the exchange programme was introduced in 1984, ostensibly to establish unity, cultural understanding and togetherness, among students of the participating states.
