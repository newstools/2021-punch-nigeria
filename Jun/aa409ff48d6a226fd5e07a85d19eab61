The Federal Government on Tuesday said it was doing everything possible to secure the release of the students kidnapped from Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri, Kebbi State. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mr. Sunday Echono, said this while monitoring the 2021 National Board of Business and Technical Examinations in Abuja. Echono said, “We need to keep our students safe in schools, we are particularly facing a developing problem with one of our Federal Government Colleges in Birnin-Yauri. “Overall, steps are being taken to secure their release, we have several interest groups that come together. “We have different security arrangements to ensure that each of our schools will step up security and set up a communication system where information can be shared very quickly. “A rapid response mechanism has been put in place to ensure a rapid response in an emergency.” On the 2021 NABTEB, Echono called on parents to ensure that their children acquire technical skills to advance their dreams for the future. He also said there was a need to encourage students to get involved in skills-related subjects in order to improve their effectiveness in the workplace. “We must stress the need for parents to understand the dynamics that are the changes that occur in the work environment and in the work of tomorrow. “There is a general tendency to believe that people focus on the mainstream program that leads to blue and white-collar jobs, this is a big mistake parents make. “If you look at the trends in the world, it’s not what you know today but what you can do and that’s why commercial and technical topics are actually more and more important than each other. “We do not discriminate in any area, but in terms of national focus and orientation, says the government, we should move towards TVET, vocational education, entrepreneurship and the skills sector,” he said.
