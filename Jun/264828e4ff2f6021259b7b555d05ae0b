Mrs Akinde, Block 7, Flat 3, Lakeview Estate, Amuwo Odofin Lagos State: I subscribed for a three bedroom apartment under PERTRUST (private developer) through the National Housing Fund. I paid close to N11 million for what was advertised as N4.5 million (which the Federal Government allowed for my level. Federal Mortgage Bank took over the PERTRUST. I have written several times to the FMBN with all the documents and evidence of payment but I have not been given the documents of ownership. I have been on it since January 2020, till now we are still on it. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I have been in civil service for 30 years. Please use your good offices to appeal to their conscience to help me.
