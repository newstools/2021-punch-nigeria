Some bandits on Saturday invaded the Kofar Gayan/Kofar Kona area of Zaria in Kaduna State, abducting about 12 residents. It was learnt that among the 12 residents were eight members of the same family. The daughter of one of the abductees, Hafsat Kusfa, on Sunday said the gunmen broke into their home around 12am on Saturday, went from room to room, and picked eight members of the family. She said, “Those hoodlums carried guns and machetes; they even spoke Fulfude (Fulani) language among themselves, but the spoke Hausa language when they spoke to us. “They left me and my stepmother (a nursing mother) to take care of the rest of the children. “They took away my father, mother, sister, and my brothers. Those taken away from our house are eight in number. “We also saw some of the gunmen bringing out other people, mostly males, from other houses and later went away with them.” “My mother and father were later released this (Sunday) morning. They have been taken to hospital.” The Kaduna State Police Command spokesman, Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the attack. He, however, added that he had yet to get details of the incident, especially the number of those abducted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
