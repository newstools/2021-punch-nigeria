An Ekiti State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Ado Ekiti, on Thursday, granted bail to two persons, Idowu Rotimi, 59, and Suleiman Ogunjobi, 63, who allegedly impersonated a judge and fraudulently obtained money to procure favourable judgment for a man. The defendants are standing trial before the court on three counts. The magistrate, Mojisola Salau, ruled that the defendants should remain in the custody of a correctional centre pending when their bail conditions would be perfected. The police prosecutor, Samson Osobu, alleged that the defendants committed the offences in Ado Ekiti in February 2021. He alleged that the defendants “conspired to obtain the sum of N500,000 from one Nathaniel Aladesiun under the pretext of facilitating favourable for him judgment from a judge, while Idowu Rotimi paraded himself as a judge in Ekiti State.” Osobu said the offences were contrary to sections 516, 419 and 484 of the Criminal Code, Cap C16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. Salau granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties each, one of who must be the monarch of their town. The magistrate adjourned the matter till July 12, 2021, for hearing.
