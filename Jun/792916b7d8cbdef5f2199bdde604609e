The management of the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, has stated that the 27-year-old man arrested by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in Lagos is no longer its student. This was contained in a statement signed by the institution’s Head of Public Relations, Umar Dabai, and made available to journalists in Bauchi on Thursday. The statement indicated that although the suspect was a student of the institution, he withdrew voluntarily from the school during the 2014/2015 academic session. “It therefore follows that the reference made to the accused being a student of the university by ads4nairablog.com is not correct and should be disregarded,” the statement added.
