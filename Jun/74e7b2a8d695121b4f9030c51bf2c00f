Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo, has bagged two nominations for the Yoruba Music and Films Awards amid her fallout with Theatre Arts & Movie Practitioners Association of Nigeria. The actress on Tuesday shared her nomination e-flier on Instagram with the caption, “2 categories! Whoever wins, we’re all winners.” Her nominations were in the ‘Best Actress 2020/2021’ and ‘World Most Relentless Influential Act 2020/2021’ categories. Other nominees for the Best Actress category are Toyin Abraham, Wunmi Toriola, Jumoke Odetola, Eniola Ajao, Mide Martins, and Bukunmi Oluwashina. For the World Most Relentless Influential Act, other nominees include Mercy Aigbe, Bolanle Ninalowo, Liz Anjorin, Toyin Abraham, Dayo Amusa and Nkechi Blessing. Ojo’s nominations come days after TAMPAN Board of Trustees and the Elders of Nigerian Motion Picture Industry sent a stern warning to her and another actress, Nkechi Blessing, over their ‘reckless accusations, abuses and embarrassment’ against the association and the movie industry as a whole. The association had earlier suspended Blessing and another actor, Kehinde Adams, aka Lege, for fighting dirty on social media over the arrest of their colleague, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha, who was accused of sexually assaulting a minor. On her part, Ojo was accused of insulting some actors for keeping mute about the case. The movie practitioners groups also barred their members from engaging Ojo and Blessing in any of their movie projects.
