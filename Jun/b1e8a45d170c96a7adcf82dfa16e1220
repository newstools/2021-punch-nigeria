The Senator representing Ikot Ekpene senatorial district of Akwa Ibom State, Christopher Ekpenyong, has expressed support for agitations for a President of South-South extraction in 2023. Ekpenyong said this while speaking with newsmen in Uyo on Wednesday. He said, “I am fully in support of the South-South presidency in 2023. I want to urge the geo-political zone to come out to contest for the highest position in 2023. We must be ready to present a candidate. I may be one of those that will seek the position. “If my party, the People’s Democratic Party, decides to throw it open I declare my intention. I will not recontest for the Senate in 2023, but I may be seeking the highest office. We (South-South) have always been cheated in the past. “You can remember when Goodluck Jonathan was to return to office in 2015 but the north said no. There was a serious gang up against the South-South. “This time things will be different, we must present a candidate, but that will depend on whether the party will zone the ticket or leave it open.” The former deputy governor of Akwa Ibom State, however, expressed the hope that the presidential ticket of the PDP will be zoned to Southern Nigeria in 2023, going by its rotational agreement enshrined in the party constitution.
