Twenty-four hours after some kidnappers and men of the Ogun State Police Command exchanged fire during which one of the suspects was killed, another one was found dead, while a member of the gang was arrested in the bush. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. Oyeyemi said members of the gang had abducted a tipper lorry driver on Friday in the Mologede area of the Odeda Local Government Area of the state, but policemen chased after them. Oyeyemi said there was a gun battle between the personnel of the command and the kidnappers, which resulted in the death of one of the kidnappers, while others escaped with bullet wounds. The PPRO added that one of the kidnappers, who escaped with bullet wounds, was later found dead in the bush, while another one was arrested. He said, “The victim was rescued. Other members of the gang escaped with gunshot injuries. “A massive manhunt for the escaped members of the gang was ordered by the Commissioner of Police, Edward Awolowo Ajogun, and in compliance with the order, the entire forest of Mologede was combed, and in the process, the dead body of one of the kidnappers was found, while another with bullet wounds was arrested. “The arrested one, who identified himself as Mohammed Bello, was discovered to be an ex-convict, who had just been released from prison in Ibadan, Oyo State. “Some packets of tramadol and weeds suspected to be Indian hemp were recovered from them.” The PPRO added that Ajogun had ordered the transfer of the suspect to the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation.
