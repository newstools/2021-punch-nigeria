Former Super Eagles players have faulted Gernot Rohr’s decision not to coach the home-based team for next weekend’s friendly against Mexico, The PUNCH reports. The game is billed to hold at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on July 3. Rohr told The PUNCH on Wednesday he shunned the friendly, which has the Eagles parading a squad of only NPFL players, side, because it was not his duty to manage the Super Eagles B side. But Victor Ezeji, an ex-international, believes Rohr is unfair to the local players. He said, “Before his (Rohr) contract was renewed, we were told that he must be watching NPFL games every weekend and also invite about six home-based players to the main national team but none of these has happened. It is not fair to these players. “The same people who told us this have not explained to us why Rohr chose not to coach the home based team.” Ike Shorunmu, a former Eagles goalkeeper trainer added,” It is not good enough but I feel Rohr’s employers gave room for that. He should be in charge of the team and not the Nigerian Football Federation Technical Director, Austin Eguavoen. Former Eagles goalkeeper and Olympian Dosu Joseph demanded that Rohr’s contract be reviewed. “So far he (Rohr) is just taking Nigeria for granted. He should be in charge of the team and not the Technical Director of the federation. It’s his job to handle the Super Eagles. In the past, the late Stephen Keshi and Sunday Oliseh, who were Eagles coaches, were also in charge of the team. Why is he acting differently now.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
