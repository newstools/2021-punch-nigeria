The Nigeria Cricket Federation has confirmed that the Women Yellow Greens will depart the country Friday for the annual Kwibuka Tournament, an international women’s friendly event, in Rwanda. The tournament, which is expected to take place from June 6 to 13 at the Gahanga Stadium in Kigali, Rwanda, will see Nigeria battle the likes of Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana and hosts Rwanda. The tournament is an annual event to commemorate the Rwanda genocide. “The players will be leaving Nigeria on Friday, June 4 and conclude the game on the 12th with the departure set for 13th,” Technical Director of the NCF, Enesi Habib, told The PUNCH. Fifteen players, with two placed on standby, have been selected for the tournament following rigorous training and selection process. A total of 40 players were invited to the first phase of camping, which took place in Abuja, and was later reduced to 22 players for the second phase. The final squad of 15 players selected for the tournament is a blend of experience and young players with some familiar names on the list. Samantha Agazuma will once again lead the team as captain with her experienced lieutenants Etim Blessing, Agatha Obulor, Salome Sunday and Esther Sandy all making the cut. The only centurion in the history of women’s cricket in Nigeria, Lucky Piety, also finds a spot in the team, making her the youngest player at 14 to ever wear the prestigious green and yellow colours of the country.
