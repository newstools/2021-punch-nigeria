GOVERNORSHIP aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress on Monday, stormed the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja, to submit their nomination and expression of interest forms in order to beat Tuesday’s deadline. Some of the aspirants include, Senator Andy Uba, Dr. Chidozie Nwankwo and Col. Geoff Onyejegbu. Speaking to the media shortly after submitting his forms, Nwankwao said, if he gets into office, “There will be a drastic change towards that agitation. If you read my manifesto, I am going to single Anambra out to become the industrial hub of Africa. And, millions of teaming youths will not have time to demonstrate when they are employed. I have done business in 7 countries of the world. “I have been to Israel about three times, I have been to Ethiopia with outstanding agricultural records. We are going to employ the best brains. “I have always partner with the best companies in the world. Why people failed in agriculture is because they don’t look for those with the pedigree. “People with the records and experience to manage their entities. And that is why they failed. Why you do bring revolution to that direction in Agriculture?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
