Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Chairman of the Ogun State Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Yemi Sanusi, has advised the seven members of the state House of Assembly who defected from the Allied People’s Movement to the APC, to abide by provisions of its constitution. Sanusi gave the advice while receiving five out of the seven members who paid him a courtesy call at the state party secretariat in Abeokuta. While assuring them that the party would continue to carry every member along, he said, “It is our duty to send messages to wards and local governments that everyone must be welcome, no discrimination, no rancour and where there is problem let us know. “Play the game according to the rules so that we can have a united party and the challenges of 2023 will be easy for everybody.” The party chairman thereafter, presented the symbol of the party including the constitution to the new members.
