Raphael Ede, Enugu THE immediate past member of the House of Representatives representing Nkanu East/Nkanu West in the Federal House of Representatives, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ujam, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, to join the All Progressives Congress. The former federal law maker and close ally of former Governor Sullivan Chime, joined the APC along with several of his supporters on Monday. He was received into APC after registering and obtaining his membership card at his Akpasha Ward Akegbeugwu, in Enugu South Local Government Area. On hand to receive him were: The Enugu State APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Dr. Ben Nwoye, former Senate President, Chief Ken Nnamani and members of the Senator Jonathan Zwingina-led Enugu State APC registration committee among others. Speaking at the event, Nwoye, expressed delight over the interest being shown by people of the state in the ongoing APC membership registration exercise. While welcoming the new entrant into the party, Nnamani said, “Your quality education and exposure are well documented. As a big fish that only swims in big water, we, APC, stand to gain what the PDP mistakenly have lost in you.” In his remarks, Chukwuemeka, who is also a former Commissioner for Lands in Enugu State, said, “I did not leave the PDP, it was the PDP that left me.” He promised to put his political expertise to use in order to boost the fortunes of the APC.
