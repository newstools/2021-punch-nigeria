Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service,  Col. Hameed Ali (retd), told  the Senate on Thursday that the agency was targeting a total of N1.47tn revenue this year. He stated this when he appeared before the Senator Francis Alimikhena-led Committee on Customs, Excise and Tariff to defend the 2021 budget of the NCS. He said that the N1.47tn included N1.27tn for Federation and N198bn for non-federation. He said when compared with the 2020 revenue target, the 2021 revenue target was higher by N85bn or 5.8 per cent. He also said that the NCS had proposed a budget expenditure of N242.45bn for the 2021 fiscal year. He said the agency would source the fund  from the seven per cent cost of collection for 2021 which was put at N96 94 bn. He put the  personnel cost at N99.72bn, representing 41.13 per cent ; overhead cost, N19.53bn,  representing 8.06 per cent and  capital cost at N123.20bn, representing 50.81 per cent. Ali said the nonfunctional scanners at the various Customs’  sites had adversely contributed to the  agency’s inability to carry out effective examination for selective consignments. He,  however, said that if purchased, the NCS would make them available in Apapa and Port Harcourt ports. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
