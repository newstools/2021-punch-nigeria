Raphael Ede, Enugu The Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr Geoffrey Onyeama, has said the All Progressives Congress APC must take Enugu state in 2023. This is coming as the leaders of the party in the state have resolved to put their differences behind and pledge to work together. Onyeama, who spoke on Tuesday at the party’s secretariat when the leaders received the Enugu State APC National Registration Committee, led by Senator Jonathan Zwingina, said the meeting had the potential of transforming Enugu State. Onyeama said, “It is necessary that we take the mantle of leadership here in Enugu State and South East in 2023. “We have the resources and people to transform Enugu state so that we become the party that truly out Enugu state in the hands of God. We want to deliver development, suffering is too much and we can’t continue like this”. The former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, who is the South East representative in the APC National Caretaker Committee, said that the essence of the registration was to dismiss insinuations in some quarters that APC is a northern party.
