Segun Adewole The Peoples Democratic Party has described as irresponsible the verbal attack by a Senator of the All Progressives Congress, Smart Adeyemi, against the Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu. Adeyemi had, during a Senate plenary, said that Abia State is governed by drunkards, adding that Ikpeazu is a “champagne drinking man.” Cautioning the Senator representing Kogi West, the PDP, in a statement issued on Wednesday, warned that it would not stomach such unwarranted and unprovoked attack on any of its governors.
