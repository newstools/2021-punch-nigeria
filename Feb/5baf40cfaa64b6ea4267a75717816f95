Leke Baiyewu, Abuja A member of the House of Representatives from Ondo State, Peter Makinde, has defected from the African Democratic Congress to the All Progressives Congress. Makinde, in his letter of defection which was read to members by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, during plenary on Tuesday, blamed his action on alleged divisions in the ADC. “You’re welcome to the progressive party,” Gbajabiamila said after reading the letter. Several members of the Peoples Democratic Party, however, screamed point of order. A leader of the minority caucus, Nicholas Ossai, who was allowed to speak, however, protested against the defection, stating that it breached Section 68 of the Constitution. Gbajabiamila, however, dismissed Ossai’s arguments, asking him or any member of the opposition to mention the name of the chairman of ADC. According to the Speaker, those protesting against the defection lacked knowledge of the goings-on in the ADC and, as such, are not in the position to query the reason cited by Makinde for the defection.
