Nike Popoola African Alliance Insurance has said it paid N967m claims to its customers in the first 40 days of the 2021 business year. The company disclosed this in a statement from its Brand, Media and Communications Manager, Bankole Banjo, titled ‘African Alliance excites policyholders with N967m claims payment’. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Joyce Ojemudia, restated the firm’s claims commitment to its policyholders. She said, “For us at African Alliance, we are poised to continue our renewed commitment to fulfilling our stated obligations to our stakeholders. “Paying claims as due, therefore, is non-negotiable. Indeed, the bedrock of a sustainable insurance business is a mutually beneficial arrangement where the insured and the insurer both stick to their obligations to each other without fail.” Disclosing how the claims were paid, she said, “Between the first of January and now, we have paid about N148.2m to 155 individual life customers, N307.5m to 141 group life claimants, N124.1m to 168 Takaful claimants, not forgetting some N387.3m to our annuitants. “We won’t shirk our responsibilities; we have promised to remain with our customers for life, we will not relent on our oars as we continue to excite our policyholders.” It recalled that in the last quarter of 2020, the firm paid over N2.3bn claims to its policyholders.
