Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Tuesday said extant education policies of administrations preceding his were tinkered with to achieve optimum performance. Governor Oyetola spoke in Osogbo during the distribution of educational materials and sports equipment to public schools. The merger of schools, single school uniforms, and renaming of public schools were some of the policies introduced by the immediate past administration of Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, that were reversed by Oyetola. Oyetola said, being a product of a public school, he was committed to restoring the lost glory and surpassing it. He said, “I did mention that as a product of public education myself, I know what public education was and as such, would be wholly committed to restoring that lost glory and surpassing it, in tandem with the realities of the fast-paced 21st century. “It is this conviction that motivated the focused audit of the education sector we did upon assumption of office and the subsequent steps taken, with the supports of our eminent education stakeholders, to review extant policies for the maximum performance of the sector.” On the ongoing teacher’s recruitment, Oyetola said only the best out of the applicants would be considered for recruitment as teachers in the state. Speaking earlier, the chairman, State Universal Basic Education Board, Mr Ajibola Famurewa, said distribution of instructional materials, sports materials, and items for School for Special Needs was made a priority by the state government to give the pupils sense of belonging. He added that the initiative was also aimed at encouraging pupils to develop skills in sports, adding that the state government, with the provision of the items had further demonstrated the resolve to concretise its legacy of qualitative education for the younger generation.
