Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The new Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, has disbanded a tactical unit of the Command known as Eagle Crack Squad with immediate effect. This came barely 48-hours after an undergraduate at the University of Port Harcourt identified as Victor revealed how an officer with the tactical unit forgot his mobile phone in his car after extorting him of N150, 000 at gunpoint. Victor had alleged that the policeman stopped his car at Rumuologu axis of the East-West Road in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the State, seized his phone and threatened to shoot him if he failed to part with a said sum, and forced him to a location to use an ATM which he complied with. The commissioner in a statement issued by the Command’s spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, ordered the men of the now-disbanded unit to report to the headquarters at Moscow Road, Port Harcourt. The statement reads, “The Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, has dissolved the Eagle Crack Squad. This was done this morning after a meeting with his Management Team. “The dissolution is coming on the heels of complaints of unprofessional conduct exhibited by the Personnel of the Unit. “Recall that the CP in his maiden Press briefing on Tuesday, February 24, 2021, promised to address all cases of infractions by the police and increase supervision of the men, with a stern warning to deal with erring officers and hold the DPOs/HODs vicariously liable. “The dissolution is with immediate effect and all Personnel attached to the unit are to report to the Headquarters for redeployment. “The public is hereby enjoined to rekindle their trust in the Police, as the Command is committed to giving them improved Policing services that will stand the test of time.”
