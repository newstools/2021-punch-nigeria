Temiloluwa O’Peters Tech firm, Tros Technologies has offered free cybersecurity training to help small and medium enterprises, as well as big corporations alike in the country tackle the rising trend of cyber risk. As the incident of COVID-19 continued to force people to work from home, the firm noted in a statement on Monday that cyber criminals were continuously on the prowl to exploit the environment with data breach and revenue losses. The company explained that the cybersecurity training program was designed to educate employees on common threats to their organization’s cybersecurity and offered a new way for SMEs to educate employees on cybersecurity risks and best practices amid the pandemic, right from their home. “As many of the businesses in our community have shifted to a work from home environment to keep their doors open, we wanted to ensure that these businesses aren’t putting themselves at greater risk later down the road,” said Tros Technologies Managing Director, Muyiwa Awosile. He continued, “Working remotely has its perks, but also comes with distractions and risks. We’re seeing a huge rise in COVID-19 scams which can pose a major risk to the security of our local businesses.” “That’s why we’re rolling out free cybersecurity training to any organization that wants it. We want to make sure your employees have some knowledge of how to protect your business. Right now, all that matters to us is coming together to protect our community.” Tros Technologies also said it had created a platform, EazyAppz, for small and medium-sized businesses to create their personal apps by following three steps, thus, enhancing further digitization of small business operations.
