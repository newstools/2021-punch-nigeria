Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin AN American-based Nigerian, Prince Eloniyo Abuda, has been found dead five days after he was abducted by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Abuda, who lived in Atlanta, Georgia, was abducted last Saturday with two other men and a woman along the Benin-Auchi road. He was said to be traveling from his hometown, Fugar in Etsako Central Local Government Area of Edo State to Lagos to catch a flight to the United States when they were seized by the herdsmen. Abuda, who was said to be the President of Fugar America Foundation, was reportedly shot by the kidnappers after he slumped during the forced long march to the bush. His decomposing body was discovered on Wednesday after the payment of the ransom to free the other hostages, who led the family members to the scene along the Benin-Auchi road end of the Benin bypass. “Prince Abuda was shot by the abductors when he couldn’t walk anymore and slumped. The kidnappers didn’t want to leave him behind as they were afraid that he will reveal their hide out to security agencies and so decided to shoot him,” a source said. Spokesman for the Edo State Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, in his reaction said, “The command is fully aware and the Commissioner of Police personally led operatives to the scene this morning and they are still in the forest on active combing of the bush.” Copyright PUNCH.
