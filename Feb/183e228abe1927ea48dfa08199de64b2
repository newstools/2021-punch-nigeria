Tony Okafor, Awka A former Special Adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Technical Matters, Akachukwu Nwankpo, says a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, should emulate his peers and seek international jobs like former Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who recently emerged as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. He advised Soludo to drop out of the November 6 governorship race instead of grandstanding as the sole governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in the race. Soludo had last week formally declared his intention to contest in the poll on the platform of APGA amid wide jubilation across the state. But Nwankpo who spoke in the Okija, Ihiala Local Government Area on Sunday said, “Soludo is a very brilliant Anambra son who is renowned and very well-travelled. I once teased him by asking him why he is here in the governorship race, when he ought to be in the world space. I hear Okonjo-Iweala every day, doing all the things she does around the world, and we believe Soludo should be there too. That is the kind of place that befits him. “The notion that the APGA ticket is settled and reserved for him is a strategy to convince everyone that the APGA race for the ticket is closed. It is a brilliant approach, but it is not true. It is only a gimmick to scare others.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
