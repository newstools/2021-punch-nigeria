Dele Ogunyemi, Warri A middle-aged butcher at the popular Sapele main market, simply identified as Efe, was on Sunday shot dead in the community by gunmen. Efe’s murder was coming up barely 24 hours after Okiemute Sowho, a Senior Special Assistant on Youth Development to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, was killed in the same Sapele metropolis. The PUNCH gathered that Efe, who was into cow meat sales was shot dead along New Road axis by Poultry Road Junction in the town. Sources said that the arms wielding men who had come in a blue, numberless Toyota Camry, had shot their target in the head at a close range while he was on top of a motocycle. A resident in the community who would not want his name in print affirmed that Efe’s killing as well as that of Saturday involving Governor Okowa’s aide were cult related.
