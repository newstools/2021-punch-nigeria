Tony Okafor, Awka A former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Olisa Metuh, on Wednesday, described his stay in the Kuje Correctional Centre, as horrific. Metuh who spoke to a crowd of party supporters in Awka, the Anambra State capital described his ten months stay behind bars as the lowest point in his life. The former PDP spokesperson was sentenced to seven years in a correctional facility over alleged financial crimes by a Federal High Court, in Abuja, but was freed on the orders of a Court of Appeal. Metuh was prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission along with his company Destra Investment Limited, before Justice Okon Abang. Abang found him guilty of illegally receiving monies to the tune of N400m from the office of the then National Security Adviser, Colonel Sambo Dasuki (retd.). However, on appeal, Justice Stephen Adah, who led a three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, nullified Metuh’s sentence on grounds of manifest bias by the trial judge, Justice Abang. Metuh, who addressed party supporters at the PDP Secretariat in Awka, during a reception organised in his honour, said, “I have been to the lowest, deepest end of the valley. I have wrestled with the demons. I wrestled with the devils. “The Almighty God has saved me. For that, I commit the rest of my life to the service of God and the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
