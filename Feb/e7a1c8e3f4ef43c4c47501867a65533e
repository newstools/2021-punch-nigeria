Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Lagos-Ibadan rail line has been connected to the Apapa Ports in Lagos State, the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation said on Monday. CCECC is the construction giant handling the over $1.6bn Lagos-Ibadan railway project. It tweeted on Monday that the rail line was connected to the ports on January 25, 2021, as CCECC successfully poured the last 25-metre monolithic track bed superstructure of Apapa Port break bulk line. The firm said, “The Apapa Port Spur Line of Lagos-Ibadan Railway starts from the Mobolaji Johnson Station, Ebute Metta and extends southward to Apapa Port, with a total length of 8.72km. “As a crucial channel linking the main line of the Lagos-Ibadan railway to the port, it has become an important transportation passage for the import and export of goods.” The firm said the rail now served as a significant guarantee with regards to the comprehensive operational efficiency of the railway.” Copyright PUNCH.
