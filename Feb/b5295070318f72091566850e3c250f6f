Olaide Oyelude, Katsina Residents of Unguwar Rimi in the Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State are now in fear following the reported abduction of 17 women from the community by suspected bandits. It was gathered that suspected bandits abductedÂ  the women, along with their babies, on their way to Garin Maigora town on Thursday for a wedding. It was further learnt that the women were taken to an unknown location. The abductors were however said to have abandoned one of the women due to the ill-health of her baby. Efforts by residents to locate the abducted women were still futile as of Friday while the abductors had yet to contact families of the victims. The residents also alleged that the bandits had recently subjected communities in the area to spontaneous attacks. The spokesman of the state police command, SP Gambo Isah, did not respond to calls and a text message sent to him about the incident as of 9:50 pm. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
