Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday charged all the permanent secretaries in the state to encourage teamwork for effective governance and development in the state. Sanwo-Olu stated this at the opening of a two-day retreat for the body of permanent secretaries at Intercontinental Hotel, Victoria Island. He called on the permanent secretaries to bring their experience to bear in seamless coordination in the delivery of the state government’s programmes and policies, adding that there must be an efficient collaboration between the permanent secretaries and political heads assigned to their ministries. The governor said, “The position of Permanent Secretary is one that comes with tough responsibilities. As experienced officers in the civil service, permanent secretaries must develop a framework for the implementation of government’s policies. This means creating viable relationships with the political heads of their ministries. “Most of the cabinet members who are also professionals may not understand the rudiments of engagement in the public service. The permanent secretaries have to put them through and streamline the activities of ministries in line with the objectives of the government. Therefore, collaboration between the cabinet members and civil service is necessary for better coordination.” The Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said the retreat would enable new permanent secretaries to learn from their older colleagues in order to run the affairs of their respective ministries efficiently.
