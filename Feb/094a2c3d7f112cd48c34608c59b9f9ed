Dayo Ojerinde The Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev. Alfred Martins, has asked the Federal Government to punish Fulani herdsmen who are perpetrating evil in the country. Martins, on the sidelines of the inauguration of the Mission House, Catholic Church of Resurrection, Magodo, Lagos, on Saturday said the feeling among many Nigerians was that the killer herdsmen were being protected by the Federal Government. He said, “The government needs to stop impunity. There are people who commit crimes, whoever they may be, they should be apprehended and brought to book. The fact that the government has not done that; that is why people operate with impunity. These rogue herdsmen occupy the forest areas, they just do whatever they like and because nobody seems to care. “The impression that is left in the minds of people is that the criminals are being protected. For what reason they are being protected, it is difficult to know’, but when you see people occupying other peoples’ land and ensuring that those people cannot use their land in peace, killing, raping and destroying properties, naturally the impression is that they are being protected. “We hope the new service chiefs will take seriously their primary task of ensuring security all over the country. There is no part of the country that is free at this point, and so we hope that the new security chiefs will do their work and justify the position they have been given.” The associate priest of Catholic Church of Resurrection, Magodo, Rev. fr. Paul Bastos, stressed the need for Muslims and Christians to live together in love. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
