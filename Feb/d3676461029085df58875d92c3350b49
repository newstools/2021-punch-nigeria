Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The All Progressives Congress candidate for the December 5, 2020 Imo North bye-election, Frank Ibezim, as affirmed by the Supreme Court, has called on his main challenger for the ticket, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, to join hands with him to develop the senatorial district. The Supreme Court, on Friday, declared Ibezim the authentic candidate of APC for the bye- election. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared the APC winner of the bye-election without returning any candidate. Ibezim, in an interview with Saturday PUNCH moments after his Supreme Court victory, urged Araraume to join hands with him to develop the zone. The politician added that he needed the support of Araraume, who was in the Senate between 1999 and 2007, to succeed in the red chamber. Ibezim said, “I give God all the glory for my victory at the Supreme Court today. We need love in Imo North to make progress. Araraume is our big brother and a two-time senator of the Federal Republic. I need his support and experience to do well in the Senate. “Not just Araraume but all the opposition stakeholders in Imo North. We need peace for Imo North to move forward. Let us give peace a chance so that, within these two remaining years, Imo North will record success. “My victory is purely of God. Since I joined this race, I anchored my trust in Him and today he didn’t fail me. The Supreme Court and the judiciary have once again showed and displayed that it is the last hope of a common man. We give God all the glory.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
