The first component is the listing or enumeration of business and commercial establishments across the country, while the second part is the sample survey, which is currently going on. “In the listing part which was completed in December 2020 and resulted in the enumeration of over 1.4 million establishments nationwide, a set of criteria had to be met by the establishment to qualify for enumeration.” He explained that to be enumerated under the exercise, the establishment must have a fixed location as well as operate from a fixed structure that could be locked up, as well as other attributes.
