Friday Olokor, Abuja The National Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Wednesday charged security agencies to maintain the professionalism they displayed during the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states held on September 19 and October 10, 2020 respectively. Yakubu said this should be done during the Anambra governorship, as well as the 2023 general election. He gave the charge during an Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security meeting in Abuja, on Wednesday. The INEC boss said, “Let me express the appreciation of the commission for the roles played by the members of ICCES in the conduct of the two off-cycle governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States in September and October last year as well as 16 legislative bye-elections in 12 states in the last nine weeks. “As you are aware, the commission has already released the timetable for the Anambra governorship election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021. We are also preparing for some legislative by-elections, the first of which is the Kafin Hausa State Assembly constituency in Jigawa State holding in the next three weeks on March 6, 2021. “I urge you to maintain the same level of professionalism displayed in the recent elections and ultimately the 2023 general elections.” Copyright PUNCH.
