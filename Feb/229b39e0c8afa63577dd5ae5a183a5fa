Kayode Oyero Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, the representative of civil society on the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry probing the alleged killing of #EndSARS protesters by soldiers at the Lekki Toll Gate, has appealed to #OccupyLekkiTollgate and #DefendLagos campaigners to shelve the planned protest and counter-protest slated for Saturday, February 13, 2021. The PUNCH had reported that the panel last Saturday decided to hand over the toll gate back to its operators, Lekki Concession Company, after forensic experts submitted their report on the October 20, 2020 incident.
