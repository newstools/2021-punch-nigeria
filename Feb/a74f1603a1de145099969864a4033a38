Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Monday threatened to suspend the operations of airlines from the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands from operating into Nigeria. It said the operations of the carriers would be suspended if their countries insist that travellers from Nigeria must carry out an additional rapid test before leaving Nigeria for the two countries. The Director-General, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Musa Nuhu, said this at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. Dubai Airports, operators of Dubai International Airport in the UAE, on Saturday released fresh travel conditions for Nigerian passengers, as the airport restricted Nigerian passengers from transiting through other airports. The move came as the United Kingdom on Friday suspended direct flights between the UAE and the UK as part of measures to curb the spread of the raging coronavirus disease. Commenting on the development on Monday, Nuhu said the UAE and Netherlands brought in extra requirements for passengers going into their countries, which were specific to Nigeria. He said, “In addition to the requirements agreed for PCR tests before you depart from Nigeria to their countries, they are also adding an extra requirement of having a rapid test done four hours before departure. “You will do the PCR test within 72 hours and in four hours before departure you will do the rapid test.” Copyright PUNCH.
