Friday Olokor, Abuja A  coalition of statesmen from the South-East under the aegis of Conference of Concerned Igbo Elders for Peace and National Unity, on Friday, said it demanded the “application of federal character principle in sensitive appointments,” saying the Igbo had been excluded from national affairs. The coalition, therefore, demanded a review of the recent appointment of service chiefs by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). The CCIEPNU, in a statement by its President, Prof William Okocha, and Secretary, Irene Chizoba, said Buhari should do the needful in the spirit of equity. The coalition also called on Igbo people of voting age to register with political parties to tackle alleged marginalisation in national affairs. The statement read in part, “As a geopolitical entity, we believe that the Igbo have been sidelined for too long, and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, have helped to sustain this act of injustice through the deliberate and orchestrated violent disruption of peace and security. “As respected elders committed to national unity, peace and cohesion, we rise in condemnation of the violent activities which, we hasten to note, are not a representation of the Igbo. “We throw our support behind Ohanaeze Ndigbo for the review of the appointments of service chiefs to accommodate an Igbo son, thereby reflecting the federal character principle.” Copyright PUNCH.
