Ada Wodu, Calabar Commuters on Friday could not travel to and from Akpabuyo and Bakassi local government areas of Cross River State as security operatives blocked the major road leading to and from the two council areas, thereby disrupting business and social activities in the two councils. The blockade with a military vehicle was carried out by a joint task force of the military, the police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. The show of force followed the killing of four policemen in the area on Thursday, with movement restricted on Atimbo bridge that links the two local government areas. Trucks carrying bags of cement and vehicles conveying traders to Ikang market in Bakassi and other places were trapped for hours. Parents could not pick up their children for mid-term break in a boarding school in Akpabuyo as they were also caught in the gridlock. Some motorists made a U-turn to Calabar. Speaking on the blockade, the state Security Adviser to the Governor, Mr. Henry Okokon, said, “You know about the incident that happened yesterday (Thursday). Even though I am not on the ground, I believe the security operatives have their strategies. Secondly, the security chiefs are aware and in charge of the operations, until I am on the ground, I can’t give you further details but I believe it’s a security strategy.” Copyright PUNCH.
