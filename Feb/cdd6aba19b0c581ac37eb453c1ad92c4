Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Government has sealed Royal Palm Estate, a property linked to Nkechi Okorocha, the wife of a former governor of the State, Rochas Okorocha,  in the Akachi axis of Owerri, the state capital. Okorocha, who now represents Imo West at the Senate, was the governor of the state between 2011 and 2019. The Commissioner for Lands, Survey and Physical Planning Development, Enyinnaya Onuegbu, who supervised the sealing of the estate on Friday, announced that the state government had recovered the property. Onuegbu stated that closing the estate was consonant with the directive of the Imo State gazette on the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on Recovery of Lands and Related Matters belonging to the state government. The commissioner added that the Governor Hope Uzodinma-led state government was passionate about recovering assets belonging to the state and its people allegedly looted by past administrations. Okorocha, in his response through his spokesperson, Sam Onwuemeodo, said Uzodinma was running away from real issues of governance staring him in the face. Onwuemeodo added that instead of fighting insecurity and implementing the payment of workers’ salaries, the governor had declared war on Okorocha, who he said was not fighting back. Copyright PUNCH.
