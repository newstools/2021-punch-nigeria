The CFAO Group, through CFAO Yamaha Motor Nigeria Limited, has partnered with a non-governmental organisation, HEDA Resource Centre, to train and equip fish farmers under the aegis of Ire-Akari Fish Farmers Association in Ebute Afuye, Epe, Lagos. According to a statement, the programme, which is part of CFAO and HEDA’s corporate social responsibility, was officially launched on February 18 in Epe, and will provide aquaculture training, extension service support and highly nutritious floating fish feed for 20 beneficiaries. The statement said the initiative was a revolving loan format that would see other members of the Ire-Akari Fish Farmers Association get support for their businesses. The Marketing Lead, CFAO Yamaha, Mr Victor Momodu, said the programme was in line with CFAO Group’s commitment to Nigeria and Africa, stating that the company’s mission was to contribute to economic growth and the industrialisation of the African continent, as well as the emergence of a vibrant middle class by creating jobs and manufacturing affordable products. The Executive Secretary, HEDA Resource Centre, Mr Sulaimon Arigbabu, said the organisation would continue to work at bringing partnerships and initiatives to empower the fish farmers towards ensuring they get maximum returns from their operations. At the event, the Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, who was represented by the Assistant Director of Fisheries Services, Mr Emmanuel Audu, applauded the initiative. He promised to support the programme by assigning agriculture extension officers who would periodically visit the beneficiaries to provide technical support for them so they could get bumper harvests at the end of the farming season. On their part, the fish farmers thanked CFAO and HEDA for the initiative, saying it would be very helpful in improving the beneficiaries’ incomes through increased productivity. The Chairman, Ire-Akari Fish Farmers Association, Mr Jelili Alausa, and one of the beneficiaries, Mr Sikiru Ajetunmobi, who spoke on behalf of the fish farmers, pledged to ensure the project’s success so they could attract similar support.
