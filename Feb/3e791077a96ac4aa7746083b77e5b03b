John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has pleaded with Nigerians not to take a cue from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to violate COVID-19 protocols. This was contained in a press statement titled, “PDP Expresses Dismay By Buhari’s Violation of COVID-19 Law…Charges Nigerians Not to Follow Such Examples,” signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Sunday. The PDP expressed dismay over the president’s reported violation of his own executive regulation on COVID-19, which provides for 6-months jail term for defaulters. Ologbondiyan said, “It is a huge national embarrassment and  gross failure of leadership that President Buhari, who ought to lead by example, is being reported of publicly violating the COVID-19 regulation, which he signed just five days ago. “Such disregard to law and rules, which have characterized the Buhari Presidency and the APC, is largely responsible for the failure of leadership under the Buhari-led APC administration in the last five years.” Copyright PUNCH.
