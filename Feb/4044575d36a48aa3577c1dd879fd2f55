Samson Folarin The Rotary Club of Ota has asked the Federal Government to encourage the establishment of ranches to reduce conflicts between herders and farmers in the country. The club’s President, Funke Salau, spoke on Saturday at a peace and conflict resolution event at the Abudu Yaya Onimupin Palace, Iyesi Ota, Ogun State. More than 200 people from different ethnic backgrounds, including religious leaders, participated in the programme, where foodstuffs were also distributed to indigent residents. According to Salau, February is set aside in the Rotary calendar for one of its seven cardinal objectives — peace and conflict resolution. She said, “The current clashes between herders and farmers, and considering that Ogun State is having its share, call for concern. Cows all over the world are reared in ranches; it is only in Nigeria that cows are let loose on people’s farms. The government has to encourage the establishment of ranches so that the chances of conflicts can be reduced,” she added. The Head of Department, Building Technology, Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Prof. Olabosipo Fagbenle, who was a guest speaker, said most societal unrest could be traced to the family unit and urged parents to give their children proper training.
