Tony Okafor, Awka A House of Representatives member for Nnewi North/South/Ekwusigo Federal Constituency in Anambra State, Chris Azubogu, has vowed to ensure that the Peoples Democratic Party retains power in the state for 24 years if elected governor on November 6. Azubogu stated this while notifying the state chapter of the PDP of his intention to contest the November 6 governorship election in the state. He said, “I have a blueprint that will put PDP in government for 24 years unbroken. The reason is that, I have the same winning streak. I have special grace of God. I have run elections and won. “I have never failed anyone. I don’t think I will fail this one. We have clear roadmap. It is not easy to win elections in Nnewi North, Nnewi South and Ekwusigo. “There is core experience I have; core competencies, relevant and requisite skills about governance. “It is not about going to Abuja to collect allocation. Very soon, revenue may not be coming from Abuja. Oil is not a business anymore. “We are in COVID-19 era. Post COVID economy is something that you cannot predict. We need someone who understands what it means to govern; who will drive us to begin to do the rightful thing.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
