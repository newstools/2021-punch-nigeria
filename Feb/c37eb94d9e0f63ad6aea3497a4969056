Dayo Ojerinde The Ogun State Government has called on residents, especially the vulnerable to take advantage of the free health services provided in all the primary health centers across the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, gave the admonition while supervising the registration of the vulnerable under the Basic Health Insurance Provision Fund in Emulu Village, Orile-Itesi, in Odeda Local Government Area. Coker noted that the basic package of the scheme include antenatal care for pregnant women and postnatal care up to six weeks with overall treatment to children up to the age of five, while the aged would have access to treatment for headache, common malaria, blood pressure, diabetes, Tuberculosis and other basic medical conditions. Lamenting the low patronage of the Primary Health Centers in different locations of the state, she said that such attitude would have negative effect on the purpose of the free health services for the vulnerable. She said, “Low patronage of Primary Health Centers especially in rural areas has become a trend in the state. Governor Dapo Abiodun has invested in infrastructure in the health sector. He is at the moment equipping health centers and even recruiting. It will not be ideal if we fail to utilise these resources. “Besides, our people have a lot to gain by patronising these health centers given the free medical treatment packaged for the vulnerable under the Basic Health Provision Fund that will take care of common medical conditions, antenatal, postnatal care, among others,” she said.
