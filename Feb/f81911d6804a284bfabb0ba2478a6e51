Joseph Olaoluwa The Lagos State newly constituted Traffic Management Enforcement Team has directed companies operating around Apapa to acquire park terminals for their fleets of trucks pending the introduction of the electronic truck call-up system. The chairman of the team, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, who dialogued with the Truck Owners Association identified seven parks as holding bay for trucks at various locations around the metropolis, according to a statement issued on Thursday by the Lagos State Ministry of Transportation. The location of the parks includes Ojota, Obanikoro, Oregun, Olowotedo-Ibafo, Amuwo-Odofin, Orile-Iganmu, Okorisan-Lekki/Epe. The parks, he said, would keep trucks away from the roads until they were called up for loading. Fayinka who doubles as the Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation explained that the team had been able to design a road map and the strategy to be adopted in solving the gridlock in the statement.
