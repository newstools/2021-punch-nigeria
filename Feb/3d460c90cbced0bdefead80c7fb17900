Nike Popoola The Chief Executive Officer, Botsurance, Samuel Adekambi, has said Nigerian insurance industry is losing about N50bn premium to fraud yearly. While speaking with our correspondent, he said that insurance penetration in Nigeria was currently below two per cent. “Available data suggest that the Nigerian government and the country’s insurance industry lose at least N50bn annually due to the activities of fraudulent unauthorised insurance providers,” he said. He added, “Of that figure, vehicle insurance is the most affected; only 20 per cent cars have valid insurance cover.” Adekambi said his firm had identified these challenges while hoping to make Nigerian lives safer with valid auto-insurance covers that required no stress to access. He explained, “Our platform aims to protect unsuspecting Nigerians in the unserved, underserved, vulnerable and low-income communities with genuine and affordable insurance products. “With the growth of Botsurance (which is facilitated by automated processes organised in efficient systems), fraudulent insurance issuers and fake insurance certificates in Nigeria will soon become history.” The Botsurance co-founder stated that in one comprehensive move, it could help the government, insurance firms, agents and Nigerians who perceived they needed an insurance cover.
