Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed, has lamented that local government councils in the state now rely on bank overdrafts to meet their monthly financial obligations because previous administrations syphoned their allocations under the guise of “joint projects.” He also lamented that despite the government’s efforts to end the menace of ghost workers, people are still devising new ways of shortchanging the government. The governor said this when he held a meeting with the local government Chairmen, their deputies and security agencies in the state at the Banquet Hall of the Government House, Bauchi on Thursday. He said: “We will do joint projects; the thing is very bad the Accountant General will give you the picture of what was done before and we are carrying the burden in the name of joint projects. They have really finished us, all the money has been spent and today, we are living on overdraft every month as local governments. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
