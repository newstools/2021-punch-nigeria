Dele Ogunyemi, Warri SOME yet-to-be-identified gunmen have reportedly shot dead a mobile policeman along the NPA New Port area of Warri in Delta State. The PUNCH gathered that the AK47 rifle of the slain cop was also carted away by the hoodlums currently on the police trail. Eyewitnesses said the policeman was seeing someone off when he was gruesomely attacked. He was said to have died on the spot. When contacted on Sunday afternoon, the Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the killing of the mobile policeman Sunday afternoon. “Yes, it is true; the police officer was shot dead on Friday as he was seeing someone off. His rifle was collected,” the PPRO said.
