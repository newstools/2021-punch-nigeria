Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Government through the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture has partnered EbonyLife Place to commence a monthly series on tourism, arts, creativity, hospitality and cultural events tagged, ‘Eko Culture Series’ to promote what Lagos represents to both local and international tourists. The Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, in a statement on Thursday said the series would be a blend of entertainment and tourism event. Speaking at the flagship of the series in Lagos at an event tagged, ‘Flavours  Lagos,’ the Commissioner said the series had been planned to run for the next twelve months. “We are showing everyone that Lagos is rich in so many other things unknown to some individuals. The ‘Flavours of Lagos’ will bring to memory some age-long meals that are gradually going into extinction. In a way, we are promoting the sustainability of what we are known for in terms of food and local delicacies. “We are also promoting healthy living and delicacies that will be attractive to our local tourists here in Nigeria and inter-continental dishes that suit the taste of international visitors to the state,” Akinbile-Yussuf said.
