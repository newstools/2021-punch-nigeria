Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government and the organised labour will reconvene on February 22 for the consideration of the reports of the bipartite technical committees on fuel price and electricity tariff. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, disclosed this Monday night while briefing journalists after a bipartite meeting between the FG and the organised labour at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Ngige said they received and adopted the report of the Technical Committee on Premium Motor Spirit Pricing Framework, while that of the Electricity Tariff Committee was expected in a week’s time. He explained that the organised labour requested for some time to subject the report on PMS pricing to their organs for further investigation. Ngige said, “It is a technical report; so they needed further investigation of the report by their own technical research team. “The technical committee on electricity tariff has not finished. We expect the report in a week’s time. So, cogently, we are reconvening on 22nd of this month to take both reports.” The report of the Technical Committee on PMS Pricing was presented at the meeting by the Chairman of the Committee, Onochie Anyaoku, a former Executive Director, Refineries Operations and Petrol Pricing in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
