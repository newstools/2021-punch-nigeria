Tukur Muntari, Kano THE Kano State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party on Monday demanded for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the state chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Abbas, for incitement. Recall that Abbas, while addressing party supporters at the swearing in of elected chairmen of the 44 Local Government Areas, at the Kano Pillars Stadium, in Kano, urged them to stockpile arms ahead of the 2023 general elections. Abbas was quoted as saying, “I order you to deal ruthlessly with anybody you see before ballot boxes trying to rig the election in 2023, this is my punishment and directive, nothing will happen.” Reacting to the comments made by the APC chairman, the state PDP Chairman, Wada Sagagi, in a press statement, he signed and made available to newsmen, in Kano, on Monday, demanded for the arrest of his APC counterpart. He said, “To ask your supporters to attack anybody they feel is rigging elections in 2023 and whatever happens you are to be held responsible clearly shows that you are irresponsible to hold any public office. “We have since written to the Inspector General of Police, Muhammad Adamu, and the DG DSS, demanding the urgent and immediate arrest and prosecution of the APC Chairman.” Copyright PUNCH.
