Patrick Odey Uyo A former member of the House of Representatives for Oron/Okobo/Urue-Offiong-Oruko/Udung Uko/Mbo state constituency under the People’s Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom State, Peter Umoh, has called on the President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd.), to encourage state ownership of ranch in the country. He said ownership of ranch by state governments would effectively tackle the seemingly recurring clashes between farmers and herders than the  Buhari’s system of land grabbing from the various states for the purpose of ranching. Umoh, a onetime speaker of the state house of Assembly spoke on Sunday while fielding questions from newsmen in Uyo, the state capital. The former member of the constituent Assembly of 1988/89 argued that cattle rearing was a business and as a business, people should be encouraged to buy land and enclosed it to stop nomadic farming. “My analysis of the situation in the South-West is that today it is happening in the West no one knows when it will explode in the South- East and in the South-South or Middle Belt, because the Fulani are everywhere. “The ranching system should not have been the way the President had taken it; to grab land from various states and given it to them. No, because cattle rearing is business. Let the people who want to do the business buy land and then enclose it so that this nomadic farming. The President can encourage each state of the federation to establish its own ranch. Think of this as one of the ways out of the farmers-herders crisis in Nigeria” Umoh said. The People’s Democratic party’s stalwart called for close monitoring of the nation’s borders to prevent outsiders coming in to cause trouble. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
