Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt THE Rivers State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Sunday, denied reports of an explosion at its secretariat, on Thursday. The state PDP Publicity Secretary, Tambari Gbara, in an interview with our correspondent, in Port Harcourt, on Sunday explained that what sounded like an explosion on the day in question, occurred at a building opposite its secretariat along the Aba-Port Harcourt express road. Gbara berated the opposition All Progressives Congress, for claiming that aggrieved members of the PDP were responsible for the blast. He said, “In the first place, there was no explosion at the party secretariat on Thursday. A banging sound was heard directly in front of the bank opposite the secretariat and therefore, every speculation Ogbonna Nwuke, and his faction of the APC has, is wrong. “PDP as a party that practices internal democracy, there is no imposition of candidates as we had our peaceful and successful primaries across the 319 wards in Rivers state, there has been no incident of crisis, disagreement. Such allegations against the party are concocted by mischief makers trying to tarnish the image of our party.” In a statement in Port Harcourt on Friday, Spokesman of the APC faction loyal to the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Ogbonna Nwuke, accused the PDP of promoting violence. He said, “We understand the angry reaction that the high handedness of the leadership of the PDP has caused the people of Rivers State and the PDP membership in particular.” Copyright PUNCH.
