Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has urged Fulani settlers in his domain to move to town and relate more with the people. Oluwo also told the settlers about how he met the President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd.), in Aso Rock and advised him to send herdsmen abroad to learn modern method of cattle rearing. Oba Akanbi made the statement during a visit to the Fulani settlers residing at Gaa Fulani, Odo Oba, Iwo. In a video of the speech made by the royal father obtained on Friday, Oluwo, who spoke in Yoruba language, said open grazing was no longer in vogue, and urged the herders to embrace modern method of feeding their animals. He said, “I was in Aso Rock and I met (President) Buhari one on one and I told him to send some of you herders abroad where you will learn modern ways to do your business. “How will a cow trek over 20 miles to graze and you expect it to be fattened? Your cows should be kept in a place where they will be well fed. “I have talked to Buhari and other leaders in the country that we need to take care of you. We cannot abandon some people in the bush and expect that they won’t behave irrationally. We want you to relocate to town, rent apartments and live with people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
