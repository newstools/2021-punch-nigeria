Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto THE Sokoto State chapter of the All Progressive Congress, has announced its withdrawal from the forthcoming Local Government Area council elections, scheduled to hold on March 27, 2021. The state party chairman, Isa Acida, said this at a press conference held at the party secretariat, in Sokoto, on Sunday. Achida said, “When the state government announced the belated decision to conduct the local government elections in the state, we expect the electoral body to arrange consultative meetings with political parties for the successful conduct of the elections. “However, to our dismay, the commission went alone and prepared their own time table, convenient to them and their paymasters, which was sent to us only for information. “One would have expected that an umpire like SIEC should have invited political parties for their inputs before coming up with an election time table. This is a further indication of their lack of fairness and unwillingness to provide a level playing ground for political parties. “In the light of these circumstances and after due consultations with all stakeholders of our party in the state, the Sokoto State chapter of the party has resolved not to participate in the forthcoming local government elections.” Copyright PUNCH.
