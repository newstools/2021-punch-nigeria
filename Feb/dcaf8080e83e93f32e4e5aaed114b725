Dennis Naku The Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State, Samuel Nwanosike, has promised to end all forms of touting and extortion of business owners in the area. Nwanosike stated this during a summit on Investment Promotion, Business Growth and Revenue Generation in the area held at Isiokpo, the council headquarters. He said the workshop was meant to enlighten business owners in the area on the need for a cordial relationship with the government. He said, “As a government, when we took over in 2018, we told our people that we wanted to run a government based on the rule of law. “So, we convened the first ever Ikwerre Local Government Revenue Summit, where we had experts talk to us on what we need to know to improve our lot as business owners in the LGA. “So, we want to educate our people who do not understand the legal provisions of how to do business and the relationship with the third tier of the government. “We want to stop the issue of revenue touting, double taxation, and harassment of business owners in Ikwerre Local Government Area in particular.” Copyright PUNCH.
