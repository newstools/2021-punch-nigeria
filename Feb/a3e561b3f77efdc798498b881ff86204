Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja A former Pastor with the Omega Fire Ministries International, Mike Davids, has sued the General Overseer of the church, Apostle Johnson Suleman, and the church for N2bn, for unlawfully interfering in his marriage. Davids had last week accused Apostle Suleman of hypnotising and committing adultery with his wife, Pastor Faith Edeko, who now heads the Utako, Abuja branch of the church. Alleging threat to life, Davids had written a petition to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, who had in turn ordered a probe into the matter.

In the petition for decree of restitution of conjugal rights, the petitioner stated that he married his wife pursuant to Section 24 of the Marriage Act at St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Ekpoma, on December 6, 2008 by virtue of which only a High Court can annul. Among other reliefs, Davids is seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining Apostle Suleman, the church and their agents from gaining access or relating with his wife and three children.
