Gibson Achonu, Owerri Tension has enveloped communities in the Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State following the decision of soldiers to indiscriminately fire gunshots ostensibly to stop alleged planned attacks by men of the Eastern Security Network in the area. Members of the ESN, being sponsored by the Indigenous People of Biafra, were said to have regrouped for confrontation with security operatives and insisted that they must leave the town.

A resident of Osu Ihitte Ukwa in the Orsu council area, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that the shooting, which started on Wednesday evening, forced many residents of the area to desert their homes, while commercial activities and vehicular movement was paralysed. He said a military helicopter hovered round the area and caused anxiety among the people.
