Nike Popoola The Lagos State Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, has urged residents who are involved in the vandalisation of highway wire mesh panels to desist from such actions. He said this while condemning the vandalism of newly installed highway wire mesh panels in some parts of the state. Speaking with correspondents in Lagos, he said some of the highway wire mesh panels around Adekunle towards the Third Mainland Bridge Ramp and Oko Baba areas had been vandalised. The commissioner blamed saw millers at Oko Baba for the vandalism of the fence. Salako said the ministry was planning an immediate sensitisation exercise for the saw millers who used Third Mainland Bridge Adekule Ramp as loading point for wood and timber. He said the saw millers used those areas as transit to load on the bridge, and in the process, damaged the wire mesh panels. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
