Matthew Ochei, Asaba Two yet-to-be-identified undergraduates of the Delta State Polytechnic and a motorcyclist have lost their lives in an accident on the Asaba-Ibusa Expressway, Delta State. The undergraduates were said to be on their way to a destination in the state when tragedy struck. A source told our correspondent that a motorcycle carrying one of the undergraduates collided with a Lexus 330 salon car belonging to a suspected fraudster. The suspect, his friends, including an undergraduate who sat on top of the vehicle, were reportedly spraying money while the vehicle was in motion. “The motorcyclist was trying to pick some of the money that the Yahoo boys were spraying into the air when he lost grip of his motorcycle and collided with the car. “The motorcyclist died on the spot, while the girl he was conveying died on the way to a hospital. The lady who sat on the car fell and was crushed by another vehicle,” the source added. Several attempts to reach the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, proved abortive, as calls put across to her phone were not responded to. Copyright PUNCH.
