Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has called on the Federal Government and its agencies in the aviation sector to reopen the Warri Airport, also known as the Osubi Airport, in Delta State. The House especially asked Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency and Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority to reopen the airport, originally owned by Shell Petroleum Development Company but later taken over by the Federal Government. The call was based on the unanimous adoption of a motion moved by Mr Anthony Afe from Delta State. The motion was titled ‘Matter of urgent public importance on the need for the Federal Government to reopen Osubi airport for operations’. Following the adoption, the House urged “the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Aviation and other relevant agencies of the government to ensure that Osubi Airport is reopened for operations as soon as possible.” Afe, while moving the motion, noted that the airport was an important facility that was privately owned and operated by Shell. He said while the facility was run in partnership with the Nigerian government, it was eventually acquired by the Federal Government in 2015 and was leased out to Shoreline Oil Services Ltd, who managed the facility until recent termination of their contract in in February 2020.
