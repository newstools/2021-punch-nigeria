Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin A Nigerian firm, Rabelat Limited, in partnership with Instituto Daniel Franco, Brazil has set up a centre for animal husbandry in Kwara State as part of measures to resolve herdsmen and farmers clashes in parts of the country. The centre, which is expected to have abattoir, international cattle market and entrepreneurial training institution, will create 50,000 jobs for youth and others in the country. The Chief Executive Officer of Rabelat Nigeria Limited, Dr AhmedÂ  Raji, who disclosed this after a meeting with the delegation from Instituto Daniel Franco at a media briefing in Ilorin, said the foundation for the project had already been laid on 40-hectares of land in Bode-Saadu, Moro Local Government area of Kwara State. He added that another 600 hectares of land had been acquired in Yashikira, Baruten Local Government Area for planting of grasses for animal consumption. Raji said the project would be a joint venture with the Brazil instituto owing to its successes in agribusiness over a century. He stated that the partnership with the institute would lead to technology transfer in areas of animal rearing, processing and packaging for export, explaining that the centre was all-encompassing and would also guard against rural urban migration when fully operational. The chairman said the centre would also have a transit hub through which animals would be provided water and feeds while they would also be provided with medical care with their owners accommodated and given a place to rest while they were in transit. He said the international market in the centre would be doing virtual marketing, adding that every cow would be tagged with the price and number to the owner. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
