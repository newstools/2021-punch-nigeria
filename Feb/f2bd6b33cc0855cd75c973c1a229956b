Tony Okafor, Awka Senate Chief Whip and a former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kali has said the membership revalidation exercise of the All Progressives Congress is valid. This is as critics say there is nothing in the constitution of the party that recognises the exercise. Kalu who spoke with journalists after a tour of the facilities of the Stanel World Group in Awka, for the Stannel Youth Empowerment and Master Class, said it was not true that the APC constitution did not have provision for membership revalidation.

As long as the NEC of the party had taken a decision on any matter on behalf of the party, it becomes constitutional. “The president, all the APC governors, legislators and officers of the party were all there when the decision was taken to amend the law and to revalidate membership of the party in all states of the country. So it is valid as far as I am concerned.” Kalu also spoke on security situation in the country, saying he expected the state governors to play more active role on the issue.
