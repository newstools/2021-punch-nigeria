Ada Wodu, Calabar A pressure group, Code 888, has begun a ‘Back to South’ campaign for the next governor of Cross River to come from the South Senatorial District of the state. Speaking during an interview with newsmen in Calabar, on Sunday, Director General of the group, Mr Maurice Nkong, said, there was an existing political culture in the state and for the sake of justice, fairness and equity, it had become paramount that power should return to the South in 2023. He said, “As a generation, we stand for rotation of power. We have a political culture in Cross River and we want it to continue. “As a group, we work through consultations and advocate for natural justice. We have done consultations and the majority of our leaders are in support of our cause. “We know how to mobilise ourselves. Code 888 is a political pressure group and we are engaging our leaders in all political parties. We have already put a political party in place in case it did not go our way.” According to him, former Governor Donald Duke from the South was governor between 1999-2007, after which Sen. Liyel Imoke from Central led the state from 2007-2015 and then the present Governor from the North, Ben Ayade, whose second tenure will elapse in 2023. He said that it was fair and just for power to return to the south in order to maintain the peaceful co-existence that the state had enjoyed over the years. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
