Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Federal Road Safety Corps has trained over 2,000 drivers of Peace Mass Transit Ltd at its annual retraining and recertification programme in Enugu. This is according to the Executive Director, Operations, PMT, David Okoroafor, on Wednesday. The firm said statutorily, corporate commercial transport operators, with a fleet of three vehicles and above, are required to undertake the cost of, and provide an enabling environment for retraining and recertification of its drivers by the FRSC. This, it said, is a mandatory condition for the renewal of its operational licence. The statement read in part, “Peace Mass Transit is on record as having the best possible record on this score. It regularly ensures drivers in its employ get these refresher courses on schedule, mostly handled by experienced FSRC operatives, at the beginning of every year, and intermittently within the year, by equally knowledgeable PMT safety and training officers.” The Head, Education Department at the Enugu FSRC sector command, Azubuike Oti, who inaugurated the training on Monday, also led other resource persons from the regulatory agency to drill the drivers. “Participating drivers are taken in batches of 50 to 70, in the exercise which is billed to last one full month. Depot managers have been guided on how to route drivers to the Emene, Enugu headquarters of the company, on different days, in a seamless order, to ensure normal PMT operations are not disrupted while the program lasts. “This year’s exercise, as in previous years, dwells on passenger/customer relations; vehicle and driver maintenance; defensive driving techniques, and highway safety protocols,” the statement read.
