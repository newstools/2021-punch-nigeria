Jesusegun Alagbe The Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, says the number of reported COVID-19 cases has declined globally for the first week in a row. He also said the number of deaths had declined for the second consecutive week, adding that these were because of countries implementing the safety protocols more stringently. Ghebreyesus said this at a briefing on Friday monitored by our correspondent. He said, “The number of reported COVID-19 cases globally has declined for the first week in a row and the number of deaths has declined for the second consecutive week. The declines are due to countries implementing control measures more stringently. “We should all be encouraged, but complacency is as dangerous as the virus itself. Now is not the time for any country to relax measures or for any individual to let down their guard. Every life that is lost now is all the more tragic as vaccines are beginning to roll out alongside public health measures.” Ghebreyesus said how quickly countries could expand vaccine manufacturing and roll-out would determine how soon the pandemic would be over. He said, “Today, I am inviting everyone to join me in the call to share technology so we can produce vaccines for the world and share them equitably.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
