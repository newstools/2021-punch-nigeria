Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Government has said that beginning from today (Thursday), the popular Olaiya intersection in Osogbo will be closed down for a period of nine months. The closure, it explained, was to pave the way for the construction of a 625-metre flyover to arrest the incessant and avoidable accidents and gridlock associated with the area. A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Transportation, Olatoke Olaniyan, said to ensure free flow of traffic along the corridor, diversion routes had been created and road diversion signs installed. The statement read in part, “In order to ensure that economic activities are not totally paralysed and ensure free flow of vehicular movement within and around Osogbo, diversion routes have been created and road diversion signs installed. “Men of the FRSC,NPF, NSCDC and OYES will be assisted by officers from the Office of Transportation in the ministry of works and transport, and other paramilitary organisations in the nine months of the construction to guide and direct motorists. “Recall that a three-hour demo was observed three weeks ago to sensitise the public and observe all precautionary measures towards the diversion routes “All corrections and observations noted during the test have been effected and new routes created. Members of the public are enjoined to observe the road signs and cooperate with law enforcement agencies to make the road diversions as seamless and smooth as possible.” Copyright PUNCH.
