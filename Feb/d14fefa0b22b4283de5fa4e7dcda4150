Segun Adewole Global rights group, Amnesty International, has condemned the strings of abductions of students in schools in the northern part of Nigeria. This was after over 300 schoolgirls were abducted from Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in the Talata-Mafara Local Government Area of Zamfara State. The abduction which happened in the early hours of Friday was carried out by suspected bandits who stormed the school in Hilux vehicles and motorcycles. The attack happened just days after some students and staff of Government Science College, Kagara in Rafi Local Government of Niger State were abducted by bandits who are yet to set them free. It would be recalled that on December 11, 2020, over 300 students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State were abducted by bandits who have since released them.
