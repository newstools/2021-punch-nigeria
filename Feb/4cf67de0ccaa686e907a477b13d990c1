Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The All Progressives Congress has called on the people of Edo State to register with the party as it will afford them the opportunity to have a say on those who govern them. The appeal was made yesterday by the party’s State Registration Committee which came to Benin for the registration and revalidation of membership in the state. The nine-man committee led by Elder Omeni Sobotie while briefing the press at the Edo APC Secretariat said that the party is focused on having a database of its members that is reflective and in line with modern democratic realities. He said that officers that would drive the process in the state were already undergoing training adding that at the end of the exercise on February 23, the party would have developed a customised permanent registration card for members of the party. Elder Sobotie, therefore, enjoined all members of the party including those who want to join the APC to go to their various wards and local governments of origin to get registered. He said, “This is the first time this kind of registration of party membership is taking place in the country. “The aim is to make APC a grassroots political party where the victory of any aspirant is guaranteed no matter the size of the electoral ward he/she is coming from. “I use this forum to enjoined members to come out and register. The beauty of it is that it will afford members the opportunity to criticise governance because they are participants in the all-inclusive exercise.” .”We are a law-abiding party that does not want to go again the Executive Order signed by Mr. President on COVID-19 protocols or what the governor has put in place to check further spread of the disease. “Those trained at the local government level will train Ward supervisors and up to the unit level. The training will be for five days. From the 4th to the 9th of this month after which the registration proper will commence.”
