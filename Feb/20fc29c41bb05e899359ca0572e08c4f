Dayo Ojerinde The Imo State Government has denied reports that a faction exists in the All Progressives Congress in the state. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Chief Declan Emelumba, in a statement on Sunday, said the only executive recognised by the national leadership of the party was led by Chief Marcelenius Nlemigbo, while the leader remained Governor Hope Uzodinma. Emelumba said anybody claiming to be the chairman of a faction of APC in Imo State was an impostor risking an arrest by security agencies. He said, “It is a well-known fact that the national leadership of the APC recently dissolved state executive committees and in their place set up caretaker committees. The chairman of that caretaker committee in Imo State is Chief Marcelenius Nlemigbo.” The commissioner described as sheer mischief and affront on the national leadership of the APC for anyone to claim otherwise.
