Joseph Olaoluwa Netflix has appointed former Uber West Africa manager, Ebi Atawodi, as Director of Payments, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Atawodi who made this disclosure via her LinkedIn page said she didn’t expect that her Uber experience to affect several lives. She wrote, “Over six years ago when I started my Uber ride, little did I know that I would be part of a mission that changed the very fabric of how cities moved forever. “I learnt the power of tenacity–launching and scaling Uber in West Africa, and then was humbled by the power of payments – unlocking that Uber magic for millions of customers all over the world. It’s been a ride of a lifetime, which has finally come to end. I am honoured and so thankful to everyone who rode this rollercoaster with me.” Atawodi, whose new role at Netflix draws on her four-year experience as Uber’s Head of Product and Payments said she was enthusiastic of the next challenge. She added, “Anyone who knows me knows I am obsessed with Netflix – the culture, the product, the impact it has had on the art of storytelling. I am excited to be joining Netflix as Director of Payments, EMEA and can’t wait to do the best work of my life.” Before her recent appointment, Atawodi worked with Uber for over six years, serving as General Manager, West Africa before taking the role as Head of Product, Payments. Prior to Uber, she served as Head of Sponsorships and Corporate Communications at Etisalat.
