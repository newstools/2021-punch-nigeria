Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Government on Wednesday said it ordered the arrest of a grandmother, Funmilayo Olalere, resident in Amondo village, near Ile-Ife, for allegedly assaulting her grandchild living with her. The suspect was said to have beaten the victim with a broom, which injured her in one eye. Rather than taking the victim to a hospital after she sustained the injury, Olalere was said to have opted for self-treatment and applied urine on the eye. The state Commissioner for Women, Children and Social Affairs, Olubukola Olaboopo, in an interview with PUNCH Metro, said her ministry got information that the suspect, popularly called ‘Iya Ibeji Olowo’ used a broom on the child. “In the process, the broom got stuck in the victim’s right eye. But the grandmother neglected the child until the eye got damaged. “Based on the information, we traced the address, which is very remote and the ministry caused the woman to be arrested; she is to be charged to court soon. “I advise parents and guardians to be humane while disciplining their children, as any violence against children would be met with stiff penalty,” Olaboopo said. She added that the suspect had been referred to the Osun Women’s Clinic, where she would undergo psychotherapy pending her arraignment in court. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
