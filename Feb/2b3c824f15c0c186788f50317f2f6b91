Patrick Odey, Uyo The Akwa Ibom State Police Command has arrested five suspects in connection with the renewed communal clashes between Ukonteghe Uda and Enwang communities in the Mbo Local Government Area of the state. The command’s Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, disclosed this on Friday while speaking to our correspondent in Uyo, the state capital. He said 18 expended cartridges, a piece of live 7.62mm ammunition and five pieces of expended 7.62mm ammunition were recovered by the police from the suspects. Sources close to the communities had told our correspondent that several houses including that of the former Inspector-General of Police, late Etim Inyang and a former member of the National Assembly, late Martin Effiong, were torched while two soldiers and a policeman were wounded in the attacks. The command’s spokesperson confirmed that houses were destroyed but stated that he was not aware of any security agents injured in the crisis. He said the state Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, had visited the troubled area to engage the stakeholders and ordered reinforcement of more personnel. Macdon said, “As we speak normalcy has returned and we hope that it will be sustained. We pray that all options should be brought to the table so that lasting peace would be achieved between the two warring communities. “What really led to this recent crisis is the unconfirmed report that youths of a particular community dragged a member of the other community into the bush and killed him. This led to the issue where some houses were destroyed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
