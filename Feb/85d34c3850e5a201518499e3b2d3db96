Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved the appointment of Gbolahan Oki as the General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, and Adenike Oyetunde as the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on persons living with disabilities. Sanwo-Olu, in a statement by the Lagos State Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said the appointment of Oyetunde was in fulfilment of his promise to appoint a senior special assistant during an interactive session with some physically challenged persons in the state. The governor noted that Oki had made significant contributions and distinguished himself in the positions he had held previously. “Mr Golahan Oki’s appointment was consequent upon the appointment and redeployment of the erstwhile General Manager of the agency, Mrs Abiola Kosegbe as Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. The appointment of Adenike Oyetunde stems from the confidence in her capabilities and demonstrated commitment to the rights and well-being of PLWDs,” he added. Sanwo-Olu urged the appointees to focus on improving service quality, adding that his administration was fully committed to meeting the yearnings and aspirations of the residents of the state.
