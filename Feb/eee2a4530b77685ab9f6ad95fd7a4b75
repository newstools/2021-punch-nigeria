Kayode Oyero The Presidency says the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is not a “showman” but he rather believes actions speak louder than voice. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, spoke on Monday while featuring on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme monitored by The PUNCH. He was reacting to Buhari’s ‘body language’ and demands that the president address Nigerians and condemn herdsmen attacks on farmers and residents in parts of the country.

For this president, it is the actions that should speak for him; he (Buhari) is not a showman, he doesn’t have to be there.” “People should not personalise the issue. This country has problems, it requires the involvement of everyone, all hands must be on the deck to solve these problems –community leaders have a role, senators have a role, everyone has a role,” he added. The President’s aide also said security agencies are on top of the situation, noting that they do not lack the political will to quench the crisis.

Is the IG of police saying he is unable to do his job because he doesn’t have political support? This president allows you to do your job.” YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Buhari won’t allow ethnic, religious violence —Aide
