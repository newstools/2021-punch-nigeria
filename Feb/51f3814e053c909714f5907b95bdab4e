Tony Okafor, Awka THE Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has described a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Chief Victor Umeh, as ‘an abandoned property.’ Ngige said this in Alor, in the Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State, during the revalidation of his membership of the All Progressives Congress. He said Umeh’s attack on his person was to regain political relevance after so many years in political wilderness. Umeh, had in an interview said, “After all his (Ngige’s) boasts in the previous elections, he lost his ward. And on November 6, 2021, he will lose his ward again because he has never won in his ward.” In response, Ngige said, “We are going to win this election. We have started. We are laying the blocks. We did the foundation. We are putting the blocks on. By November 6, you’ll see the house, the roofing and everything that a complete house has been built. We’ll go into the election with seen and unseen forces.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
