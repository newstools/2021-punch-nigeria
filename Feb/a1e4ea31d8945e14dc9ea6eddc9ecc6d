Nike Popoola Zenith Bank Plc has again emerged as the ‘Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria’ in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2021. The bank disclosed this in a statement on Sunday titled ‘Zenith Bank emerges Nigeria’s most valuable banking brand’. The statement said for the fourth consecutive year, Zenith Bank had been ranked as the number-one banking brand in Nigeria with a brand value of $275m, moving up two places from 392 in 2020 to 390 in the 2021 global ranking of banks.
