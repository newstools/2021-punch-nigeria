Sodiq Oyeleke Independent National Electoral Commission says its plans to expand polling units in the country were misunderstood. The electoral body said this in a series of tweets on Friday. The PUNCH had reported that INEC would be expanding the access of voters to polling units in subsequent elections. The commission said it would address the inadequacies of polling units in Nigeria and the challenges they pose to election management. The tweets read, “The voters’ register increased to 84,004,084 by 2019. We envisage that by the next Election in 2023, the population of the registered voters may be twice the number projected in 1996. Yet, the number of PUs remains the same. This is a national problem. It must be addressed in earnest. “As you are probably aware, the Commission has reviewed the previous efforts at expanding voter access to Polling Units in 2007, 2014, and just before the 2019 General Election and why they were unsuccessful. “We came to the conclusion that our genuine intention may not have been properly communicated for input by Nigerians. We also tried to solve the problem too close to General Elections. The exercise was therefore misunderstood and politicised”
