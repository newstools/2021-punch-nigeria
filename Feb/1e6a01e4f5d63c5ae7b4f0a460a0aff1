GODWIN ISENYO Senator Kabiru Marafa said on Saturday in Kaduna that his faction of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara was ready for genuine reconciliation with  the former Governor Abdulazeez Yari’s faction. This, Marafa, who represented Zamfara Central in the 8th Senate, said was to consolidate the party in order to end the lingering crisis in the state, noting that politics was all about the people. The former lawmaker spoke during a meeting with his supporters from Zamfara State in Kaduna on Saturday. The meeting followed an earlier meeting convened by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC in Abuja which reconciled the warring factions of the party in Zamfara State. According to Marafa, as a peace loving and loyal party member, his faction of the party was ready for reconciliation, adding that everybody would be carried along. Copyright PUNCH.
