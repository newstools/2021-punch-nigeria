TONY OKAFOR There was pandemonium on Saturday when youths suspected to be thugs disrupted a sports event organised by a governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, Val Ozigbo, at St Andrew’s church premises in Nnewi, Anambra State. It was learnt that though the event, tagged ‘Walk4Health,’ was scheduled to begin at 7am, the thugs invaded the venue at about 6:20am and destroyed some of the equipment, including tables and canopies, to be used for the event. A source who did not want to be identified said the attackers were sponsored by an opponent of Ozigbo ahead of the November 2021 governorship election in the state. “We know where the vandals came from. They are working for a governorship aspirant from this community (Nnewi). They are just afraid of Ozigbo’s growing popularity and profile,” the source said. Ozigbo, who is a former Chief Executive of Officer of Transcorp Plc, condemned the action, describing it as uncalled for. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
