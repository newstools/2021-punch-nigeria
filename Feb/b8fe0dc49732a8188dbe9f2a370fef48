He spoke in Victoria Island in Lagos at ‘Radio Now’s Urgent Conversation’ with the theme, ‘The Fierce Urgency Of Now: Tactics And Strategies To Pull Nigeria From The Brink’. The governor’s comment came amid the herdsmen crises rocking the nation with non-state actors issuing eviction notices to Fulani herdsmen accused of kidnappings, killings, rape, amongst other crimes. “Banditry is badly hurting our rural economy, driving farmers off the land, stealing their cattle, kidnapping them and their families for ransom and often killing them,” El-Rufai lamented on Friday.
