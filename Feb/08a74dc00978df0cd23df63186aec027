Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa THE immediate past Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Seriake Dickson has urged Bayelsans especially members of the Peoples Democratic Party to support Governor Duoye Diri, to succeed. He said the success of the administration will provide the foundation for PDP’s campaign in future elections. Dickson, who is now the Senator representing Bayelsa West, spoke while congratulating Diri for successfully providing leadership for the state in the last one year. He said, “I call for continuous support and prayers for the prosperity government of Governor Diri and his team. And I urge all Bayelsans particularly within the PDP to shun divisiveness, rumours and unnecessary propaganda. “Elections are still far away. God has seen us through a very turbulent election and restored our mandate. The task is to unify and concentrate on delivering the dividends of democracy. “Those with different ambitions and aspirations should shelve them and concentrate on supporting the governor to succeed which is going to be the basis upon which the party will campaign in the next election. I once again advise that this is not the time for politics.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
