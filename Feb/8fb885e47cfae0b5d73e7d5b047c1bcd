James Abraham, Jos THE Plateau State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Monday, warned the ruling All Progressives Congress against cajoling its members to partake in the ongoing APC registration exercise. The warning was contained in a statement signed by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, John Akans, in Jos. He alleged that the APC was “using false propaganda and “hawking” their membership card from house-to-house deceiving people that it was for economic empowerment having subjected the people to poverty for the past six years.” The PDP further alleged that the ruling party was using surreptitious means to lure unsuspecting residents of the state into joining the party. The statement read in part, “We have been reliably informed that as at today, the registration agents at the polling units are just sitting idly day in day out without people coming out to register as a result of that the agents have been instructed to compose fictitious names of people and even names of dead persons are compiled in their new register in order to swell the register.” Copyright PUNCH.
