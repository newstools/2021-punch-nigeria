Samson Folarin The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has flayed the high level of corruption in the health care system in the state, saying his administration will insist on a new order. He noted that doctors must render services to justify their salaries. A statement on Sunday said the  governor spoke during a meeting with doctors drawn from the State Hospital Management Board, Edo Specialist Hospital, Edo Primary Healthcare Agency and the Ministry of Health, at the Government House in Benin City. Obaseki said, “I have seen corruption like never before in the health care system. It is alarming and unacceptable. We have drawn the line and it will not be business as usual. It is left to you to either join us or take a bow honourably. “The modality of having just one doctor in Igarra, two in Auchi, while more doctors are in Benin, doing nothing; patients in these areas visit private hospitals because they have lost fate in our system. On no account should any doctor refuse posting. “For the past 10 months now, I have had the opportunity of studying the healthcare system in the state. It is so clear that the system has collapsed. We have no choice but to move forward and collectively, we must improve the system and make the people trust the system again. “We must chart a new course for a better and improved healthcare system in Edo State. We have introduced the Edo Health Insurance Scheme. We have already started deducting health premiums for civil servants since last month and we must give them good services.” Copyright PUNCH.
