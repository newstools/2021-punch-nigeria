Ada Wodu, Calabar The Cross River State Police Command has arrested five suspects in connection with the killing of four policemen in Calabar, the state capital. The cops — two inspectors and two sergeants — were killed by gunmen between 12 midnight and 1am on Thursday at a makeshift checkpoint at Ayan Mbat community on Idundu Road. Their guns were allegedly carted away by the hoodlums. Confirming the incident, the state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande, said, “We have gone to the scene to see what happened. The attack was devised to dampen our spirit. Our spirit is not dampened. “We have arrested five suspects. More will be arrested. From intelligence gathered, a group of cultists wanted to get equipment for their initiation coming up soon; in the next few days, we will get all of them. “We have started recovering some of the weapons they snatched, thereby reducing the threat they would have posed.” Our correspondent, who visited the scene of the attack, observed bloodstains on the floor where the men were killed. Residents noted that they heard prolonged gunshots in the night, saying the policemen might have been caught unawares. “By the time we woke up, we saw the bodies of the policemen,” a resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added.
