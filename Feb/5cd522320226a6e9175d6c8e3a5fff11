Friday Olokor, Abuja A coalition of 52 northern groups have accused unnamed ‘desperate southern politicians’ of spearheading what it described as the resurgence of ceaseless antagonism against the North in a bid to take power by all means in 2023. Spokesperson for the Coalition of Northern Groups, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, raised the alarm at a press conference in Abuja, on Thursday. He noted that northerners were unwilling to continue to perpetually remain at the receiving end of violent agitations for the break-up of the country. The group said, “We invite the desperate southern political power seekers, who feel that their only path to gaining the presidency in 2023 or in the future is by fomenting trouble and inciting hatred against other components of the country, to note that their actions will not go unnoticed and no section of the country will succumb to any form of shift of power under threat.” Copyright PUNCH.
