Segun Adewole The Peoples Democratic Party has demanded the sacking of the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), for “abdicating his statutory duties in asking unarmed Nigerians to defend themselves against armed aggression by bandits and terrorists.” The party said the Minister’s statement, which it described as reckless and irresponsible, is a confirmation that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has “surrendered to outlaws and has no determination to fight them.” READ ALSO: Buhari names Audi new NSCDC boss The PDP said this in a statement issued on Thursday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. The party said, “It is unthinkable that a government would describe unarmed victims of armed aggression of terrorist and bandits as “cowards” while those who were elected and given the necessary resources to defend them recede in the comfort and safety of their offices in Abuja. “Such disposition to security; a statutory responsibility of government, goes to validate apprehensions that our nation is indeed descending to a failed state under the Buhari Presidency, where the government can no longer perform its duties while unarmed citizens are left to confront bandits and warlords.
