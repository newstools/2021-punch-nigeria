Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Five days after the bloody clash between the Hausa/ Fulani residents in Shasha, Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State, the tension in the community has begun to ease. This is following the town hall meeting between governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Sani Bello of Niger State, Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State, Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State, and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, with the Hausa/Yoruba community in Shasha. During the town hall meeting, which lasted about two hours, reviewed the origin of the crisis which escalated on Friday leaving casualties and destruction in its trail on both sides. Noting that the two ethnic groups had co-existed mutually for several years without a serious face-off of this magnitude, the governors linked the crisis to a lack of understanding. Makinde reminded the gathering that the two ethnic groups had fused together, “Our people have inter-married.” Although he did not mention names, he apparently made reference to the classic marriage between the children of the late Senator Abiola Ajimobi and Governor Ganduje, saying it is more rewarding to live in peace and harmony than to relate as enemies. Bagudu, who lamented the sad incident between the two groups, however, promised that the northern governors would give necessary support to Governor Makinde in restoring normalcy and redeeming the lost property. He said, “The Nigeria Governors’ Forum will also support him (Makinde) to ensure that those who have lost their livelihood are supported in this trying period.”
