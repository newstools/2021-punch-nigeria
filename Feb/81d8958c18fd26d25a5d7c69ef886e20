A chieftain of the All Progressive Congress in Ogun State, Mr ‘Tope Akintunde, has commended a former governor of the state, Gbenga Daniel, for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress, describing him as an invaluable asset to the ruling party in the state. In a statement on Friday, Akintunde said Daniel, as a the former national leader of the opposition party in the state, was joining the APC at a time Governor Dapo Abiodun was raising the bar of leadership in the state He said, “It’s obvious that the defection of the calibre of someone of Otunba Gbenga Daniel’s towering status politically into our great party is really a great catch, really too good to be true. Here is a man that served twice as the governor of the state with lots of achievements in poverty alleviation, youth empowerment and employment, massive rural development across the 20 local governments, opening up the state for serious economic prosperity, among others. “And 10 years after leaving office, people are still talking about his legacies. He is definitely coming to add a lot of values to our great party as well as the government of Prince Dapo Abiodun that has remained committed to making life a lot easier for everyone in Ogun State. This is also in addition to our Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, who returned home last week to revalidate his party membership. Ogun APC is indeed poised for the next level”.
