Keystone Bank in partnership with Mediatent Nigeria Limited, a media company, have unveiled a mini web series for youths. The series, titled, “Adventures of a Nigerian Dude,” was based on the story of a streetwise young Nigerian graduate, who decided to use his knowledge, creativity and talent to create employment for himself and other young people around him. Keystone Bank said the collaboration, which was part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, aimed to project the creative ingenuity of the Nigerian youth, as well promote entrepreneurship. The bank’s acting Head, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Izore Bamawo, said the sponsorship aligned with the bank’s commitment towards youth development and entrepreneurship. She stated, “Keystone Bank is committed to ensuring that youth and entrepreneurship development is at the fore front of our CSR drive as the importance of these sectors cannot be over-emphasised.” Also, Mediatent Chief Operating Officer, Chinyere Fred-Adegbulugbe, said the company was excited by the benefits the partnership would bring. ‘The Adventures of a Nigerian Dude’, which would be viewed on a dedicated YouTube Channel and all social media platforms, would run from April 2021, for 13 weeks in the pilot phase.
