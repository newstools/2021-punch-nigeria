Matthew Ochei, Asaba Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has said that over N28bn is expected to be pumped into Asaba airport by the consortium over the concession period of 30 years. Okowa stated this at the agreement signing ceremony between the Delta State Government and Asaba Airport Company Limited on Tuesday in Asaba. The governor explained that the concession would run for an initial period of 30 years after the Delta State Executive Council and the Delta State House of Assembly and the consortium reached terms that would improve the development of the airport. He said, “FIDC-MENZIES Consortium has agreed to pump N28bn into the development of Asaba International Airport. This development will enhance economic growth and employment. “The name of the Airport shall remain Asaba International Airport. However, the concessionaire, upon discussion with the state, can include tagline to the existing airport name for the purpose of branding. “There shall not be any publicly or privately-owned new airport, whether greenfield developments or expansions in Delta North Senatorial District of Delta State during the concession period. “ Copyright PUNCH.
