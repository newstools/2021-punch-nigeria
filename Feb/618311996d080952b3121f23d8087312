Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State Government on Wednesday said it had uncovered a plot by unnamed politicians to instigate violence in the state and blame it on Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. The Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, said this at a media briefing in Ilorin on Wednesday. Ajakaye said, “The plot also includes the sponsorship of spurious corruption allegations using sexed up official documents and innuendoes in the media to blackmail the governor, urging members of the public and security agencies to be wary of the conspiracies. “The objective of the plotters is to create a false image for the governor as a promoter of violence, thereby heating up the polity in the name of politics and pitting him against the public. “The desperadoes behind this plot do not care about the safety of the ordinary people and their properties.” Copyright PUNCH.
