The Assistant General Overseer, Admin/Personnel, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Johnson Odesola, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to put all necessary machinery in place to halt the preventable and unnecessary killings being perpetrated by herdsmen and bandits in the country. According to a statement, Odesola, who is also the Pastor in charge of Region 1, RCCG, told journalists at the RCCG headquarters, Throne of Grace, Ebute-Metta, Oyingbo, Lagos State that the terror was bad for the country, economy and socio-economic lifestyle of the affected communities and states. He said, “Some herdsmen have even boldly come out to say all the land in Nigeria belongs to them and they are free to live in any part of Nigeria and move their cattle anywhere in the country, a statement capable of giving the herdsmen the opportunity to continue to flex their muscles in their deadly act, whereas there are no-go areas in the North when it comes to citing churches.” Odesola therefore advised the President to honour and listen to God, while he sees himself as the father of every Nigerian, and endeavour to bring the country together.
