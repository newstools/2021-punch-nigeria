Obasa, who is one of those championing mobilisation in support of the presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, said this in a statement on Thursday.” He urged Nigerians to support Tinubu, saying, “anyone who has governed Lagos State effectively and performs can lead Nigeria. “Let us support our own and be vocal with it; let us support Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. We will continue to support our leader and we must continue to support our Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu because we have no doubt that he will continue to deliver,” Obasa was quoted as saying during the commissioning of blocks of classrooms in Badagry, Lagos. The Speaker also called on the government at all levels to consider prioritising education in the country. “We should learn from this and contribute our own quota to educational development, it doesn’t matter how little. “Let us support our representatives. It is not his duty to do it, but he said that he went round and decided to do this to help the people of the constituency,” Obasa said. Setonji David, who built the blocks of classrooms, appreciated the people of the constituency for giving him the opportunity to serve. “During my visits, I discovered that many of the schools in the constituency had inadequate classrooms, which was why I decided to provide these six classrooms for this school,” he said.
