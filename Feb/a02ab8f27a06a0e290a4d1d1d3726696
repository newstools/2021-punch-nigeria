Nike Popoola The Ogun State Government has warned residents against breaking of seals placed on any property by government institutions as a result of enforcement exercise. It said this on Friday in a statement titled ‘Ogun govt cautions property owners against breaking govt seal’. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Tunji Odunlami, who gave the warning after an enforcement carried out at Ilishan, Remo, said anyone caught indulging in the act, would face the wrath of the law. Odunlami said the placement of seals on buildings, either residential or commercial, meant the owner of such buildings must have contravened the law. He said the act of sealing up properties was a regulatory procedure taken after necessary notices had been served. He described the removal of seal by a petrol station at Ilishan and some gas outlets as an effrontery on government and an illegal act that would no longer be tolerated by the agency. Odunlami urged members of the public to cooperate with the state government by reporting cases such as violations to the nearest zonal town planning office. The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr Tunde Olugbewesa, advised operators of illegal filling stations within the state to visit any zonal town planning office in the local government of operation to get necessary approvals.
