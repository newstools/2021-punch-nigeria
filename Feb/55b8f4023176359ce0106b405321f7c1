The Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has lauded the party members for standing firm and being steadfast. The party said the members’ loyalty and faithfulness were not in vain, citing the achievements of Governor Dapo Abiodun. It recalled the attack by thugs on the campaign team of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abeokuta, venue of the presidential rally organised by the APC in 2019. The statement, which was signed by the Publicity Secretary of the state APC Caretaker Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, to commemorate the second anniversary of the attack, said, “With the record-achievements of Prince Dapo Abiodun in all sectors of the economy, our sacrifices have not been in vain.” Copyright PUNCH.
