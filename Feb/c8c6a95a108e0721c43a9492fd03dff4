Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, said the peace of Niger Republic must matter to Nigeria, being “our very close neighbour.” He therefore commended the country’s outgoing President Mahamadou Issoufou and his government for keeping to their country’s Constitution with respect to run-off polls scheduled for February 21, 2021. According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President spoke while receiving in audience former Nigerian Vice President,  Namadi Sambo, who is ECOWAS Head of Mission on the elections in Niger Republic.

Noting that Niger was our very close neighbour, the President said the peace of the country must matter to Nigeria. “Neighbourliness, whether national or individual, is very important, as the peace of your neighbour, or lack of it, may also affect your own well-being,” Buhari stated.
