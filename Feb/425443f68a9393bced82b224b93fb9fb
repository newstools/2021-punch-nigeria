Friday Olokor The National Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (Youth Wing), Belusochukwu Enwere, on Saturday, called on Nigerian youths to reunite the country during the Valentine’s Day celebration, rather than indulge in immorality and vices. Enwere, in a statement in honour of Saint Valentine, said the celebration should not be turned to a money-making venture with those in the entertainment and sundry businesses laughing all the way to the bank. He also advised youths to observe the COVID-19 protocols in line with the directive of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. While advising them to “show the entire nation that we are one,” he said Valentine’s Day should teach them peace, unity and oneness. He said, “Our youths should shun bad practices, immorality and other social vices that could demean human integrity. Valentine’s Day should teach us about sacrifice. It is about nurturing our families and promoting the spirit of giving, sharing and sacrificing.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
