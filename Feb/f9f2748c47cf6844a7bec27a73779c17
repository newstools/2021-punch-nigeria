Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Scores of women from Epie and Atissa Kingdoms in the Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, on Wednesday, staged a peaceful protest against the menace of herdsmen around their communities. The women, who barricaded the Etegwe-Edepie Roundabout in Yenagoa, the state capital, chanted solidarity songs in their dialect and brandished green leaves. Their action caused gridlock as the roundabout connects roads leading to the Shell gas gathering facility, the Niger Delta University, the popular Mbiama-Road and Imiringi flow station belonging to Shell.

One of them, Mercy Adovuya, said, “We cannot continue to keep quiet over this problem. We don’t want cattle in our area again. It is time for the government to act before something else happens. “Enough is enough. The herdsmen should leave our farmlands. The state government should protect us and our crops from herdsmen and their cows.” READ ALSO: Drones to deliver COVID-19 vaccines in Kaduna
