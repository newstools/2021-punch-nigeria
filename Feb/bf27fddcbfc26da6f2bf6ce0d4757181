Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, has said the ongoing nationwide membership registration/revalidation of the ruling All Progressives Congress will deepen democracy. Bagudu spoke with journalists after he and nine other APC governors joined the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to revalidate his party membership in Daura, Katsina State, on Saturday. He said, “The exercise is meant to deepen democracy and show respect for party. “Institutions of party and sanctity of those institutions are key ingredients of democratic governance and the President is personally leading by example to show that party’s organs do matter and party’s membership do matter and it is a way to deepen democracy.” The governor expressed the belief that all party stakeholders and supporters from across the country are happy with the opportunity to demonstrate their love for the party. He said, “Prospective members who have not had the opportunity to register before or who were not of age during the last registration would now have the opportunity. I hope and believe they will be more than the members we currently have.” Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, said the party would seize the opportunity of the exercise to consolidate its position. He said, “The significance is that APC is trying to consolidate its holding and we came all along to join Mr President in order to ascertain and confirm the importance.” Copyright PUNCH.
