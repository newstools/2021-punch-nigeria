The EFCC equally wishes to remind members of the public that unauthorised use of the name and image of someone else, is identity theft, a criminal offence. The commission will not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law on any erring individual or group.” YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: At last, FG reopens Third Mainland Bridge
