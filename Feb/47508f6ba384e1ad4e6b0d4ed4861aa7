Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna A former member of the House of Representatives,  Aminu Sani-Jaji ion Sunday expressed confidence that the All Progressives Congress will reclaim Zamfara State in the 2023 elections. Sani-Jaji based his confidence on the recent reconciliation between a faction of the party loyal to former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and the other loyal to Senator Kabiru Marafa. The former lawmaker who was also an APC governorship aspirant in 2019, said this in an interview with newsmen in Kaduna. He said, “From what has happened about the reconciliation, let me say we are all people of faith; reconciliation is an integral part of our religion and we must abide by that. “Apart from that you can only succeed if you come together.  Forget the fact that APC is an opposition party in Zamfara State, we all know that Zamfara is a stronghold of the APC but because of the crisis that erupted in 2018, we lost everything. “But we have no regret whatsoever because it was ordained by Allah that such a thing must happen and we are only ambassadors of executing God’s plans and we cannot run away from that.” Copyright PUNCH.
