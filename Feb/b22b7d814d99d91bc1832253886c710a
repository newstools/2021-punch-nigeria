John Alechenu, Abuja THE Peoples Democratic Party has mocked the All Progressives Congress for extending its registration exercise by additional three weeks. According to the opposition party, the APC was finding it difficult to manage the exercise owing to the confusion and violent disagreements within their ranks. This was contained in a statement titled, “Extension Won’t Help Your Flopped Membership Drive, PDP Mocks APC,” signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Monday. The PDP said, “Its three weeks extension will not change the public rejection that greeted the exercise and the APC as a party. “Our party is already aware of the confusion in the APC after a genuine report from the field indicated a huge reduction in APC membership profile, given that more than half of its members across the federation refused to revalidate their membership while most regular Nigerians who they approached, responded with vehement apathy. “Nigerians are also aware of the bitter disagreement among desperate APC power mongers from Kogi, Lagos and Kaduna states over allocation of membership figures as well as location for final compilation of APC fictitious membership inventory. “The public now knows why the APC desperately sidestepped its original membership register, in the fraudulent exercise, as revealed by the recent outburst of the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed. “It is indeed instructive that Nigerians have rejected the APC despite being lured with money in Taraba, Kogi, Imo, Kaduna and other states; despite the threats in Kano as well as attempt at night registration in Enugu and some other states.” Copyright PUNCH.
