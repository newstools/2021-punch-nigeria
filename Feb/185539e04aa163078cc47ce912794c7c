Kayode Idowu. Damaturu Residents of Damaturu, the Yobe State capital woke up on Sunday to see many of the structures in the town defaced with the poster of the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello for president in 2023. The poster advertising Yahaya to take over from Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 were seen in various parts of the Damatutu metropolis, including parts of the street leading to the Government House and the big roundabout along Potiskum road. The posters were also posted on every known structure on Gashua and Gujba roads. Other areas included the Pilgrim Commission roundabout, Maiduguri bypass and House of Assembly Road roundabout. Although, Bello is a card carrying member of the All Progressives Congress , the  posters did not bear any party logo but inscription of “Yahaya Bello for President, 2023” was boldly written them. It was gathered that some youths from the 19 northern states had recently gathered in Abuja requesting Yahaya Bello to contest for the number one seat in the country under the APC ticket. A chieftain of the APC in Yobe state, Goni Gadaka, said good governance was an ideal concept important for achieving the socioeconomic development of a state or nation. He described Governor Yahaya Bello ascendancy to the helm in Kogi State on the back of a dead politician as miraculous, noting that he has acquitted himself well ever since. He called on people of the state to “continue giving their support and cooperation to Governor Yahaya Bello’s 2023 Presidential ambition.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
