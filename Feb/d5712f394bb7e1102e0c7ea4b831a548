Dayo Ojerinde An author, Mr Tony Olaniji, has advocated the teaching of children in the mother tongue, saying such will improve literacy. Olabanji, at the presentetion of his book, ‘Kíyèsi – A Collection of African Stories for Children,’ said teaching children in their mother tongue would help to preserve peoples’ culture. He said, “When you check critically, most of what we become now was got at the formative years, especially from ages four to 10. Whatever literature, entertainment and education that a child is exposed to at that particular stage is very important. I felt I’ve been reading books and it is time for me to contribute my quota to the knowledge base. “The children are the future, at adulthood, there is nothing you can do again. The children stage is when you can inculcate positive values in them.” The author said the title of the book was chosen to stress the importance of paying attention. “Kiyesi simply means that you pay close attention to something. What are we paying attention to? We are paying attention to the children because they are vulnerable. To ensure that our cultures are not eroded, we need to go back to the basics. We were taught basically in our mother tongue in primary school,” Olaniji said. The book reviewer, Mr Folu Agoi, said the book featured seven exciting fables drawn from the author’s local Yoruba environment. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
