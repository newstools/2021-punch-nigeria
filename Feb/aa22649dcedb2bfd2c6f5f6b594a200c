Tobi Aworinde The Federal Government has provided succour for 707 households affected by communal crises in Ondo and Oyo states which led them to relocate to Kwara State for safety. According to a statement titled ‘FG Sends Relief Items to 707 Households in Kwara Affected by Communal Crises,’ the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar-Farouq, made the presentation in Ilorin on Saturday, while sympathising with the victims. Umar-Farouq told Governor AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), directed the ministry to activate the National Emergency Management Agency humanitarian response mechanism to ensure that the displaced population was provided with basic humanitarian items. Umar-Farouq was quoted as saying, “It is our hope that the beneficiaries of this programme will make good use of the opportunity to increase their income, enhance their food security and contribute towards improving their living standard.” In his address, AbdulRazaq praised the Federal Government for its foresight in creating a ministry to cater to the needs of the vulnerable. “This is the only government that has looked into the plight of the poor in this country with a resolve to ameliorate the scourge. The Conditional Cash Transfer is a system that works. N20,000 may look small to those living in the urban cities, but in Kwara State, a woman used her meagre grant to build a school.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
