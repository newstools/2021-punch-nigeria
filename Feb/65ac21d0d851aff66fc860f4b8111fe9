Dennis Naku,  Port Harcourt Supporters of the Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress and their counterparts in the Peoples Democratic Party on Sunday disagreed over an attack on APC members in Oyigbo Local Government Area of the State. The state APC Publicity Secretary, Ogbonna Nwuke in a statement, on Sunday, expressed concern over what he termed ‘unwarranted attack on its members by a group of persons alleged sponsored by the PDP. Nwuke said, “We have been briefed by the leadership of our great party in Oyigbo that thugs dispatched by the PDP stormed a recent meeting called to articulate the way forward. “It is shocking that desperation on the part of the PDP over the growing popularity of the APC in Rivers State, particularly in Oyigbo, led members of the ruling party to contemplate violence. “The Rivers people are free to make their own decisions. In this instance, many Rivers people are choosing to pitch tent with the APC. “We have learnt that the APC in Oyigbo has not only reported the incident to the police, it has equally forwarded the particulars of the PDP thugs who were recruited to cause mayhem on the day of the meeting.” In response, the State PDP Publicity Secretary, Sydney Tambari denied the allegations. He said, “The PDP in Oyigbo local government area has no hand in the internal wrangling of the APC. The fracas that exhumed in an APC event in ward 3, Oyigbo local government was as a result of disagreements among two rivalry factions of the APC and has nothing to do with the PDP or with the State Chairman of the party, Amb. Desmond Akawor who is a seasoned diplomat and has no business in hiring touts.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
