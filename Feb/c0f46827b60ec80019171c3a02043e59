Chukwudi Akasike THE immediate past deputy governor of Nasarawa State, Mr Silas Agara, has said Governor Abdullahi Sule was yet to inform him of his interest in seeking a second term in office if any. Agara explained that though it was not time to begin to talk about the 2023 governorship election, the incumbent had yet to officially declare an intention to seek re-election. The former deputy governor who served under the administration of Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura, said this in an interview with The PUNCH. He was reacting to Governor Sule’s claim that there was an agreement that Agara would not contest the 2023 election against him. Sule, who spoke during the flag-off of the All Progressives Congress membership registration /revalidation in Motor Park 11, Gudi, Akwanga Local Government Area of the state, said he enjoys a cordial relationship with Agara. He said, “Today, I wish to tell you that there is no friction between me and the former deputy governor of the state. I know at the end of today, the former deputy governor will not contest against me, come 2023 governorship election. That is the understanding we had with him.” However, Agara in a telephone interview with our correspondent, said, “To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think he (Governor Sule) has declared for 2023 governorship position yet. He has not declared that he wants to contest. “If he declares for a second term and he needs my support, then we will talk about it. But I don’t think we have got to that level yet,” the former deputy governor stressed. On the relationship between him and the incumbent governor, Agara agreed with Sule that there was no friction between them. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
