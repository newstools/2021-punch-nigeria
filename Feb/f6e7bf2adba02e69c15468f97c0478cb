Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency on Thursday sealed a supermarket in the Ogba area of the state. The general manager of the agency, Mr. Afolabi Solebo, in a statement said the supermarket, named, ‘Home Affairs Supermarket’ was located on 21 Ijaiye Road, Ogba, and was sealed for displaying expired chocolates and frozen foods on its shelves to be sold to consumers. He noted that despite several public enlightenment campaigns and warnings given by LASCOPA, store managers still sell expired and hazardous products that are dangerous to human health. The general manager said he discovered the expired items on the supermarket shelves on February 23. “I told the staff to remove the items which they did in my presence only for the monitoring and enforcement team to go there the following day and discovered that the items were still found on the promo shelf,” Solebo said. He added that the agency had to seal the supermarket in the interest of the general consumers in the state. Solebo urged consumers in the state no to hesitate to report any supermarket or shops in the state where expired products were sold.
