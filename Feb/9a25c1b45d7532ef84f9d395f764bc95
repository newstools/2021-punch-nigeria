South Sudan regained its right to vote in the UN General Assembly on Thursday after paying part of its debts to the organization, a UN spokesman said Friday. “South Sudan has made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears,” which allows it to regain the voting rights lost in January, said General Assembly spokesman Brenden Varma, without giving a figure. Juba had to pay a minimum of $22,804 dollars to regain the possibility of participating in a ballot.
