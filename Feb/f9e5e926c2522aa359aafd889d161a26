This occurred barely 24-hours after a midnight inferno consumed goods and property worth millions of naira at the Timber Market in the Marine Base area of the metropolis Eyewitnesses said the fire was caused by a food vendor who left her food on the fire. A resident who gave his name as Michael narrated how he rescued his three-month-old baby after a neighbour alerted him. “I rushed inside my house and took my baby immediately. I am homeless now. I don’t know where to start,” he said. Meanwhile, a charcoal fire which was not properly put out has engulfed a restaurant at Owoniboys area on Ibrahim Taiwo Road, Ilorin, Kwara State, on Thursday night. The state fire service in a statement by its Head of Media and Publicity, Hassan Adekunle, confirmed the incident. He added, “If not because of our quick response to the incident, the inferno would have become a huge one due to the proximity of a filling station to the scene of occurrence.” Copyright PUNCH.
