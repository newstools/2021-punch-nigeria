An All Progressives Congress chieftain in Ikire, Irewole Local Government Area of Osun State, Col. Olayiwola Falabi (retd.), says the best thing that has ever happened to the party is its ongoing membership revalidation and registration exercise. According to a statement, Falabi said this on Saturday shortly after his membership registration at Unit 3, Ward 4, Oke-Ola in Ikire. The former Social Democratic Party member noted that the membership registration had further authenticated his membership of the APC and those of his followers in Irewole LGA. Falabi stated that with the present arrangements, the APC and SDP alliance and coalition had again been concretised the more.
