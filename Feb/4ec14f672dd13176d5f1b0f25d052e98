Matthew Ochei, Asaba THE Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has faulted the concession of the Asaba Airport by the state government. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa had on Tuesday signed a 30-year concession with a consortium. The consortium is expected to inject N28bn into the airport within the period. However, the APC, in a statement signed by its state Publicity Secretary (Caretaker), Mr. Sylvester Imonina, the party said, “Unfortunately, the fraud called concession of Asaba Airport will go down in history as the greatest bleak, shady business, and economic coup against Deltans. “It is an affront to common sense that an airport wherein more than N40bn was invested was given as concession for N4bn and to yield N100m annually because of vested interests. “A mathematical calculation of the above figures shows that Deltans will not recoup the expended income for the concession in the near future, how much more make profits from it.” The party challenged the state government to make public details of the public tender issued before the agreement was signed.
