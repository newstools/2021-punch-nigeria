Temiloluwa O’Peters The Chairman, Board of the Solid Minerals Development Fund, Uba Malami, has said the organisation will work with critical stakeholders on the development of limestone granules in Ebonyi State. Malami noted in a statement on Wednesday that the fund was already engaging the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative and the OCP of Morocco following the presidential approval of ‘a strategic investment fund for the SMDF to fast track the development of limestone granules in Ebonyi State.’ According to the board chairman, the need to work with PFI became necessary in order to harness Nigeria’s abundant deposits of calcium carbonate. He added that the fund signed an MoU with the OCP of Morocco because it was the leader in fertilizer production in Africa. Malami said, “As we speak, the OCP of Morocco is scheduled to establish three blending plants in Nigeria namely, one in Sokoto where they have laid a foundation for the factory; one in Kaduna; and the third factory in Ogun State. “These have been very engaging and stakeholders in the calcium carbonate industry have indicated interest and are working closely with the companies as well as identifying more areas of possible collaboration.” He gave the assurance that as a public sector institution, the SMDF would position itself very well to support most of the activities. Speaking on the most significant achievement of his board, the chairman said it worked on a structure that would complement the effort of government to provide a sustainable funding window for mining projects in the country.
