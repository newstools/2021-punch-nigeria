Dayo Ojerinde The Chief Executive Officer of GSK pharmaceutical company, Emma Walmsley, has said the role of vaccine in fighting the coronavirus cannot be underestimated. Walmart, in a statement on Sunday, said her firm and CureVac N.V. had partnered to develop the next generation mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. She said, “We believe that the next generation vaccines will be crucial in the continued fight against COVID-19. This new collaboration builds on our existing relationship with CureVac and means that together, we will combine our scientific expertise in mRNA and vaccine development to advance and accelerate the development of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates. At the same time, we will also support the production of CureVac’s first-generation vaccines with the manufacture of 100 million doses in 2021. “Through this new exclusive co-development agreement, GSK and CureVac will contribute resources and expertise to research, develop, and manufacture a number of novel mRNA vaccine candidates, including multi-valent and monovalent approaches. The aim of this work is to offer broader protection against a variety of different SARS-CoV2 variants, and to enable a quick response to new variants potentially emerging in the future.” The Chief Executive Officer of CureVac, Franz-Werner Haas, said, “We are equipping ourselves to tackle future health challenges with novel vaccines. “As part of the new collaboration, GSK will also support the manufacture of CureVac’s first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate CVnCoV which is currently in Phase 2b/3 trials.” Copyright PUNCH.
