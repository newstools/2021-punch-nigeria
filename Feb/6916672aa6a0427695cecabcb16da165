Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The compulsory COVID-19 test for judiciary workers in Osun State scheduled to commence on Monday could not start even though the employees turned out for the test. Checks by The PUNCH revealed that the workers had converged on the premises of the state High Court in Oke Fia, Osogbo, for the test. But they were later told that the test would no longer hold. The Registrar of the High Court, M. A. Lasisi, had in a circular in January directed all staff of the judiciary below Level 12 to stay at, and work from home, so as to contain the spread of the pandemic. He had stated, “All staff members affected should stop coming to work with effect from Monday, February 1, 2021. Furthermore, all members of staff of the Osun State Judiciary should undergo COVID-19 test immediately. “The Osun State Government is gracious enough to be conducting the test free of charge. All court rooms and offices, where the affected officers are working, should be closed down forthwith until further notice.” Efforts to get further clarification on the development on Monday proved futile as calls to the Commissioner for Health, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, were not answered, while a text message sent to his mobile telephone had not been replied to as of the time of filing this report. But the Chairman, Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, Osun State branch, Gbenga Eludire, told The PUNCH that the test was suspended due to logistic challenge. Eludire said, “Our management had summoned all members of staff of the judiciary to appear at the state headquarters for the test. Unfortunately, on getting there, it was another story entirely. The test could not be conducted due to logistic problems.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
