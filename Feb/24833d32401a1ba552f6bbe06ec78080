Segun Adewole The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has faulted the statement made by his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, which supports the free movement of herders with AK-47 rifles. Mohammed had yesterday said the herders use the weapons to protect themselves from the dangers in the forest and also from cattle rustlers.
