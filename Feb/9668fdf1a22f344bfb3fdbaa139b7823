Dayo Ojerinde The Special Adviser to the Lagos Governor on Housing, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, has appealed to practitioners in the real estate sector and the general public to support the state government to eliminate unethical practices in the real estate industry. Toke-Benson, in a statement urged real estate professionals to stop the activities of dubious agents and ensure they are dealt with in accordance with the state law. She was quoted to have spoken during the Alphacrux Real Estate Outlook Conference held virtually on Thursday. The Special Adviser who spoke as a special guest maintained that if integrity was restored to the real estate profession, more international investments would be attracted to the country. Speaking on the relationship between LASRERA and the regulatory bodies in the real estate business, Benson-Awoyinka said, “LASRERA was not established to assume the position of the existing professional regulatory bodies for real estate practitioners, rather, the agency should be able to work together with existing regulatory bodies to sanitise the sector together. “Basically as government, LASRERA came into being as a response to perceived and reported cases of fraudulent practices in the real estate sector. Constitutionally, government exists for the purpose of protecting lives and property.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
