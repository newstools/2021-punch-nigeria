Ada Wodu, Calabar The Governor of Cross River State, Prof Ben Ayade, has congratulated former Nigeria’s Finance Minister, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, on her confirmation as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, describing her as a record-breaker. In a statement signed by Ayade’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Christian Ita, the governor described the new WTO DG as the “poster girl of unassailable attainments and a record-breaker who has not only shattered a glass-ceiling but has continually proved her mettle and brought honour to the country. “We are extremely proud of one of our very best, our own dear Ngozi who has just emerged the first African, the first woman, and the first black Director-General of WTO. “As the Managing Director of the World Bank, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Dr. OKonjo-Iweala brilliantly distinguished herself to the applause of her countrymen and women and to the admiration of the world. It is not, therefore, a surprise that the international
community found her suitable for the exalted office of the WTO,” Ayade said. The Governor also expressed optimism that the state will benefit immensely from her new role. “I have no doubt that her wealth of knowledge will be of huge benefit to Nigeria, particularly Cross River, and the world at large,” Ayade said.
