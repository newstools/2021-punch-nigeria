Friday Olokor, Abuja A former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Imo State, Chukwuma-Machukwu Ume (SAN) has expressed optimism that the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world will end medical tourism by Nigerian elites. Ume expressed this view in a statement on Sunday while reacting to the ongoing building of the ultra-modern Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital in the Uburu community area of the state. According to him, the rampaging pandemic will compel the political leadership of Nigeria to build world-class medical facilities that will cater for the health needs of the people. While lauding the Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, for his giant strides in improving the welfare of his people, Ume said the teaching hospital, upon completion, would be the best in Africa. He said, “The turn of events is showing that for some countries and people, the COVID – 19 pandemic may end up with salutary effects. Some visionary leaders in Nigeria are looking inward as to end the age-long medical trips abroad. “The current ugly trend wherein Nigerian and African elites troop to Europe and America for medical treatment would soon end with them looking inwards to Nigeria.” The lawyer who recently inspected the teaching hospital project alongside Umahi said the facility which is about 75 per cent completion, would provide medical services in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, kidney diseases, tuberculosis and heart-related ailments in the country.
