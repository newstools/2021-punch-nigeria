Adelani Adepegba, Abuja FIVE members of a gang which specialised in the abduction and sexual abuse of women and girls have been nabbed by operatives of the Intelligence Response Team. The suspects were apprehended following the abduction of women in Port Harcourt and its environs. Their victims were reportedly subjected to sexual abuses and ransom demanded from their families before their release. A statement titled, ‘Police arrest five for multiple abductions, car theft and abuse of women, child pornography’ by the Force Spokesman, CP Frank Mba, disclosed that the suspects always targetted lone female drivers of Porsche cars while driving out of offices, shopping malls or any vulnerable places. According to Mba, “They (suspects) trail them to lonely roads, abduct and take them to their criminal hideouts, sexually abuse them and demand ransom from their families. “They also sell off their exotic cars. Four AK-47 rifles, one double-barrel shotgun and set of military camouflage uniforms suspected to have been illegally acquired, which they wear to beat security checks, were recovered.” Copyright PUNCH.
