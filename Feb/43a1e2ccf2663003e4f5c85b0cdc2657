Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, says he bought his third jet during the raging COVID-19 pandemic which pushed the country into an economic recession. Suleman said this while delivering a recent sermon. Although the date of the sermon could not be verified, the video recently went viral on social media. The cleric further stated that he was praying for the pandemic not to end because he was prospering and resting.
