Tony Okafor, Awka A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Andy Uba, has denied reports that he hijacked the membership revalidation and registration of the party in Anambra State. Uba said the story about him trying to hijack the exercise was false, and should be discarded. In a statement issued by his media office on Wednesday, Uba said, “As you can see, the APC in Anambra has been having a seamless registration where citizens of the state owing to the numerous successes of the Federal Government in the state are daily registering in their hundreds with the party. “Part of these successes can be attributed to the efforts of Senator Andy Uba who mobilised every ward in the party with funds and logistics to encourage the people to identify with the party in this current registration exercise. “It is surprising to see news stories running wild with frivolous allegations on an attempt by our principal to hijack the process. Such stories had even accused supporters of the senator both imaginary and real of attacking the state party chairman, Chief Basil Ejidike, but there are all false. “We wonder why any right thinking human should make such wild accusations, and what Senator Uba, our principal, stands to benefit from derailing the registration process as alleged by these mischievous few.  We therefore urge party members and the public to kindly disregard such allegations.” Copyright PUNCH.
