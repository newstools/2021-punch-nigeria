Adamawa State Polytechnic, Yola, on Monday, reopened, following its closure over students’ unrest which resulted in the destruction of 500-seat multipurpose lecture theatre, Students’ Union Government building and a male hostel. The unrest was sparked by the celebration of outgoing students. The institution’s Media and Public Relations Officer, Albert Maltilda, who announced, the reopening of the institution, said the management after review of the unfortunate occurrence, took the decision to reopen the institution, which has been closed since March 25, for academic activities to resume, from April 26th. He said part of the pre-condition for reopening the school after management’s review was  that each student would be levied the sum of  N3,410 as charges for the destruction they caused on the school properties. He said, “Students in the department of Crime Prevention Management and Control, responsible for the mayhem are  surcharged N6,820. Examinations will continue on 28th to 30th April, 2021 and only students who have paid their charges will be allowed to continue with their exams.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
