Kwara State Government on Tuesday said it has recruited at least 130 health workers into the state civil service, a step meant to improve patient-to-health giver ratio and better medical service delivery in the state. The Director-General of the Kwara State Hospital Management Bureau, Dr Sa’ad Aluko, disclosed this at the induction ceremony organised for the new workers employed at the General Hospital, Ilorin. Aluko said, “We have recruited at least 90 nurses, 19 doctors and at least 20 other allied workers. All together, we are recruiting into primary and secondary health facilities and the number will keep increasing. “The governor saw the need for us to improve health care services in the state. He saw the need to repair more of our hospitals and he is a strong believer that the hospitals will not just run itself. That will even increase our services. So, our services have been increasing. People are having more confidence in our services and this has increased patients’ patronage.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
