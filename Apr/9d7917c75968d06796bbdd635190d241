The group is known for remaking, mimicking and recreating multimillion-dollar music videos, movie scenes and movie trailers using ordinary household items. A few days ago, Netflix announced plans to feature Ikorodu Bois in its Oscar Weekend Film Brand Campaign.
The company, in a statement made available to The PUNCH, said its campaign was targeted at celebrating fans for the important role they play — for watching, loving, discussing, and even recreating Netflix movies. The statement read in part, “Netflix’s wide reach has woken up a new generation of global film fans, allowing them to discover more diverse perspectives, see themselves reflected and inspiring new forms of movie-love. “Once a year, the Oscars pierce the culture and put movies on our collective minds, and this year, we are putting the spotlight on the Ikorodu Bois to remind movie fans that fans are the most important part of the movies.” The Ikorodu Bois also recently bagged a nomination in the 2021 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, having made it to the list of nominees for the ‘Favourite African Social Media Star’ category, which was won by kid comedian, Emmanuella.
