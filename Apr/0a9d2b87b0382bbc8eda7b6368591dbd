The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has invited the Speaker of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Mr Bamidele Oloyeloogun, following allegations of financial misappropriation in the Assembly. The Speaker was said to have been invited to the Lagos office of the commission on Friday. It was earlier reported that the anti-graft commission arrested and detained the Clerk of the House, Mr Bode Aladeyelu, a lawmaker, Mr Bankole Felemugudu, representing Akoko South-West Constituency, and two other civil servants. The spokesperson for the Lagos office of the EFCC, Mr Ayo Oyewole, confirmed the invitation of the speaker by the commission to our correspondent. When asked if the Speaker was invited, Oyewole simply said, “Yes, the Ondo Speaker was invited to our office.” It was gathered that the Speaker was almost detained at the EFCC office as he reportedly declined to take pictures in the office which was said to be part of the commission’s procedure. A source said Oloyeloogun refused to take pictures as he insisted that his lawyers must give advice before he could do such a thing. The source added that it took the intervention of some lawmakers that accompanied the Speaker to the commission’s office before the matter was resolved. The matter was said to have dragged for hours. The source said the Speaker was later released and allowed to return to Ondo State on Friday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
