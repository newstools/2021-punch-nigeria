The elevation of the Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Networks Limited, Segun Ogunsanya, to MD/CEO of Airtel Africa Plc, has received plaudits from President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (Retd.). In a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, Buhari said the flag of Nigeria had been hoisted proudly across the African skyline once again. Congratulating Ogunsanya, he said the appointment had proven that Nigeria had a surfeit of quality professionals, who could hold their own in any part of the continent, and beyond. “President Buhari is sure that, with the cognate experience of the new MD/CEO for Africa, which spans consulting, banking, fast moving consumer goods, and telecommunications, he would acquit himself creditably in his new role, and repeat the strides that made him position Airtel Nigeria as the second largest telecommunications company by revenue, serving over 50 million customers,” Adesina said. Buhari urged younger Nigerians to draw inspiration from Ogunsanya, saying with focus, hard work, and resourcefulness, they would reach the peak of whatever careers they have chosen for themselves. “The reward for hard work is more work,” Buhari said, as he wished Ogunsanya greater successes ahead.
