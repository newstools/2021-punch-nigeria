Shock and disbelief greeted the arrest of popular Nollywood actor Olarenwaju James better known as Baba Ijesha on Thursday when the Lagos State Police Command made a revelation that the comic actor defiled a 14-year-old girl. In the light of the skepticism, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Muyiwa Adejobi, has said that there was substantial evidence against the actor as he was caught in the act on Closed Circuit Television. Speaking with The PUNCH, Adejobi said, “The CCTV caught the suspect in the act.” The PPRO had earlier in a statement titled, ‘Lagos Police Arrest, Investigate Popular Nollywood Actor For Defilement’ said “the case of defilement was reported on 19th April, 2021 by one Princess Adekola Adekanya ‘f’ at Sabo Police Station and transferred to the Gender Unit of the State CID, Panti, Yaba Lagos for proper investigation.” “Based on preliminary findings, the suspect started sexually assaulting the victim, 14 years, since she was 7 year old. The suspect confessed to the crime and was also captured by a CCTV camera in the house of the complainant,” he had added. According to the police spokesman, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered for proper investigation as he promised to do justice in the matter. Some tweeps have, however, doubted that the actor engaged in the act. @MorakinyoIdris wrote, “This cannot be true.” “I don’t believe this,” stated @muinhert. “Baba Ijesha finally acted movie in real pictures,” @OwoBanks mocked.
