A coalition of pro-democracy organizations on Tuesday, barricaded the entrance of the National Assembly in Abuja, protesting against the non-passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. As early as 9:30 am, the activists numbering over 300 besieged the main gate leading into the assembly, despite the presence of the fierce-looking armed security operatives. According to them, the legislature should pass the Bill before the June 12 2021 democracy day and ahead of the 2023 general elections. The pro-democracy groups at the protest included Yiaga Africa; Albino Foundation; Centre for Democracy and Development; CLEEN Foundation, Inclusive Friends Association; International Press Centre; National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies; Nigeria Women Trust Fund; and Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa. The Director of Programmes in Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mambalu, who read a statement on behalf of the coalition, said the passage of the bill would rekindle the hope of Nigerians in the democratic process. She said that the urgent need for reforming the electoral legal framework was founded on the broad-based consensus by Nigerian citizens and electoral stakeholders on the need for a more credible and improved electoral process. Mbamalu said, “We are now in the second quarter of 2021 and the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is yet to be presented for third and final reading in both chambers of the National Assembly. This process is required before the Bill can be transmitted to the President for his assent. “In considering the Bill, NASS must undertake an in-depth consideration of the citizens’ priority issues to address identified gaps in the current electoral legal framework.” Copyright PUNCH.
