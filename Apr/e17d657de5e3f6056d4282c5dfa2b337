Nine months after colliding on short notice, Kamaru Usman and Jorge Masvidal clashed for a second time with the welterweight title once again hanging in the balance. There had been bad blood between both fighters after their previous meeting last July. Usman unperturbed by boos from the fans walked into the octagon to an Afrofusion song. In front of a 15,000 sold out capacity at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Area in Jacksonville, Florida, Nigeria’s Usman attacked with the jab while Masvidal attacked the legs. Usman landed two quick right hands but Masvidal’s tough chin took it with ease. Usman made a powerful takedown and landed several punches. Masvidal landed some punches and a knee but with a commanding performance, Usman takes the first round.
