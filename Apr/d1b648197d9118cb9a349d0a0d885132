May their souls rest in peace,” he further quoted the President as saying. On the recurring incidents of kidnappings and killings in Kaduna State, in particular, Shehu said the President condemned them as “barbaric terror attacks,” and described as “unfortunate the tenor of some political and religious leaders that seem to further incite and stoke the pain and anguish of mourning families who are forced to confront these atrocities. Addressing this scourge, requires a great show of empathy and coming together as a society to squarely confront these elements and the danger it poses to our democracy and peaceful life in the country.” READ ALSO: Why we beheaded businessman whose wife raised only N40,000 out of N5m ransom –Suspected kidnapper The presidential aide said Buhari gave strong assurances that those that think that profits can be made, either from money paid as ransom or in politics, “will realise sooner than later that they are bound by the same fate as their victims. “Banditry, kidnapping and the politics of murders will be fought with all the resources available to our country.” READ ALSO: Panic-stricken South Easterners recount horror tales from attacks on police facilities
