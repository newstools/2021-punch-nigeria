There was a free flow of emotions as family, friends and colleagues gathered at the burial ceremony of the late actress and popular television presenter, Rachel Bakam. The deceased’s mother, Mrs Rose Bakam, while speaking at the burial in Abuja on Friday, recounted her last moments with her daughter while she was still on admission in the hospital. Bakam, who hailed from Fadia Tudun Wada in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna state, died on April 13th, 2021 at the age of 38, after battling pneumonia. She studied English and Theatre Arts at Ahmadu Bello University and Digital Filmmaking at New York Film Academy. Prior to her death, she was the Managing Director of Rayzeds Media Ltd and also the Founder/President of the Nigerian Water Ski And Wakeboard Federation. She hosted ‘Trends & Rachel’ ― a popular television show that aired on some Nigerian television stations, which she later changed to “Rachel the PIPER,” and its Hausa version ‘RACHEL MAI KAKAAKI’ ― an entertaining, yet highly humanitarian television programme. Bakam was until death an anti-human trafficking ambassador. She joined the non-government organisation ― Devatop Centre for Africa Development ― in campaigning against sex trafficking and other forms of modern slavery in Nigeria. During her lifetime, she received over 200 awards, honours and recognitions both nationally and internationally.
