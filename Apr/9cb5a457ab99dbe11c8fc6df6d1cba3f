The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria on Tuesday appealed to the Federal Government to summon a national dialogue in the face of rising security challenges in the country. Briefing journalists shortly after a meeting of Pentecostal Bishops held at Grace of God Cathedral, Enugu, the PFN said danger was looming, warning that if something was not done urgently there would be catastrophe. Chairman of the Christian group, Bishop Dr Godwin Madu, said, “The agitation for succession coming from different parts of the country is as a result of lack of confidence in the government and the marginalisation of some segment of the country in the scheme of things.” PFN warned the Federal Government that now was not the time of talking tough without commensurate action. The cleric warned that the 2023 general elections was under threat. “Government should, therefore, dialogue with the agitating groups at different parts of the country, including youths, religious leaders and people of different ethnicity and languages. The country is boiling here and there, and the government is turning a blind eye. The government should as a matter of urgency call for discussion/dialogue to end this looming trouble. While declaring that the general insecurity and bloodletting in the country called for concern, Madu said “The Fulani herdsmen go about killing people, burning houses and raping our innocent daughters, mothers, and wives. We condemn these actions; it has never been so in the past.” On the 2023 general elections, the PFN said efforts should be made to secure the land ahead of the election, stressing that “only credible leaders who can turn the fortunes of the country around for the good of the people would be elected.” Copyright PUNCH.
