Online marketplace, Jiji.ng, has launched its Ramadan charity market offering low prices for things needed for the period. In a statement issued by the company on Tuesday, Jiji also said it had collaborated with a non-profit organisation, Islamic Strength, to provide an avenue for people to donate to an Islamic cause. It said it would be setting aside N1 for every unique view recorded in the Ramadan store. It added that for every deal struck on Jiji, N10 would also be donated by Jiji to Islamic Strength, who will in turn be using the proceeds to feed the less fortunate across the country. Jiji said, “This presents itself as a great opportunity to do great deeds by simply doing what you love, browsing the Internet and shopping. Just by visiting and viewing the Jiji Ramadan charity market, you are automatically feeding someone in need. “The Jiji Ramadan charity market is stocked with everything needed to make your fasting period memorable and liberating.” The company added that it had sellers from all across the country selling items such as Hijabs, Kaftans, Abayas, groceries, fruits and grains.
