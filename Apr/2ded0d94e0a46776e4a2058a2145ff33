Leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State have called on the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, to caution Chief Odion Olaye. Olaye, a former All Progressives Congress’ chairman in the local government who dumped the APC alongside Obaseki, was removed as leader of the PDP in the local government at an enlarged meeting of the party. He was replaced with Chris Imalele. They also passed a vote of no confidence in Olaye. Spokesperson for the PDP leaders in the council, Mr Edo Aguebor, said the decision to pass a vote of no confidence in Olaye was due to his actions “which are inimical to the growth of the party in the area.” He said, “We call on Governor Godwin Obaseki to call Chief Olaye to order and stop destabilising the party in the local government. “We have observed that Chief Odion Olaye, the erstwhile chairman of the APC, who defected with the governor to the PDP, has made every effort to maintain peace in the party  impossible as he holds factional meetings and intimidate members. We just can’t allow this to go on. “As a result of his anti-party activities, the local government is lagging in infrastructural provision and appointment. It is when we are united that there will be progress. “This is the reason why we invited all former political appointees, former leaders and party’s executive for a meeting and came to the conclusion that there is need to appoint a new leader.” When contacted on the telephone, Olaye said the PDP leadership in the state has invited him for a meeting on the matter and that he would talk to journalists after the parley.
