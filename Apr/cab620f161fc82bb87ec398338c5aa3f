Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday expressed concern over mining activities which he said constitute a threat to government’s investment in other sectors. Oyetola pointed out that mining activities had led to contamination of Osun river with heavy metal and other contaminants. Oyetola, who spoke at the inauguration of Osun Mineral Resources and Environmental Management Committee, at the Government Secretariat, Abere, also noted that the state was littered with mining sites that required reclamation. He said “The Osun river has been polluted with heavy metals and other contaminants thereby threatening our investments in the water sector. Our land is also littered with an array of abandoned mining sites that require decommissioning and reclamation. “I hereby call on this committee to rise to the occasion. The time to rein in the defaulters and ensure this ugly trend is reversed is now.” He warned that mineral resources explorers must comply with environmental standards in the state or face legal action.
