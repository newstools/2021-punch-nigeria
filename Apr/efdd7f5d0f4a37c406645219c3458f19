An agro-based outfit, Makarois Global Resources, has said it has concluded arrangements, in partnership, with Sterling Bank to finance 200,000 farmers drawn from eight states, including Kano for the 2021 farming season. Addressing about 2,000 farmersâ€™ cooperatives from eight senatorial zones at an interactive session held in Kano on Monday, the Managing Director of Makarois Global Resources Limited, Binchang Binfa, sensitised farmers on available financial sources for the 2021 farming season. According to him, the interactive session, among others, will link one million farmers from Kano, and seven other states, with access to market and finance, within the next three years. He added that this was to provide a holistic solution to the challenges faced by most farmers in Nigeria. Similarly, Binfa noted that the company had created an innovative platform, Makfarmers Register, which incorporated verified farm data/farmer profile, with real time support and access to finance information and markets.
