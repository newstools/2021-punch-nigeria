The Owode-Egba community in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State has received a new transformer after an eight-month outage. The management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company on Saturday commissioned a new 2.5 MVA, 33KV/11KV transformer in the community valued at N21m. Youths in the community, under the auspices of Owode-Egba Youths Development Movement, in January protested against the development. They lamented that efforts to ensure that the IBEDC replaced a burnt transformer were futile. The community youth leader, Abdul-Fatai Soyoye, described the development as the beginning of a new dawn in the area. He added that the eight months of blackout would finally come to an end. Soyoye said, “Since August 9 last year Owode Egba hasn’t had electricity. But today we are appreciating everybody including the IBEDC, kabiyesi and other well-meaning people. Everybody put effort together including youths to achieve this. We are thanking Almighty God that this new one should be a new beginning in Owode-Egba.’’ In his remarks, the Chief Technical Officer of the IBEDC, Akin Abiodun, said the company generated N7bn monthly revenue from its coverage areas. He stated that N2bn out of N7bn comes from the state alone. He added that one-third of the company’s revenue comes from Ogun State. Abiodun said, “On the entire monthly collection, we have been collecting over N6n but recently we slipped into N7bn and of course, the entire Ogun region pays N2bn; one-third of our revenue is from the state.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
