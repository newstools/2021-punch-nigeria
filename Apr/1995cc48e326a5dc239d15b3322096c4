Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, on Friday, directed the state House of Assembly to start using the main conference hall of the Local Government Service Commission in the state for its plenary sessions pending the renovation of its burnt legislative chamber. Saturday PUNCH reports that a fire razed the legislative chamber of the House of Assembly on Wednesday night, leading to destruction of facilities inside the chamber, including furniture and interior decorations. Masari gave the directive when members of the committee set up by the House of Assembly to investigate the fire paid a visit to his office. The governor, who said the step was to ensure that legislative activities did not suffer because of the burnt chamber, lauded the inclusion of professionals in the committee and assured them of a timely renovation of the burnt chamber. He, however, called for early submission of estimates for the renovation exercise. Earlier, the House Leader, Alhaji Abubakar Abukur, told Masari that the visit was to brief him on the composition of a 14-member committee to investigate the cause of the fire incident and determine the extent of damages. According to him, the committee has only two weeks to submit its report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
