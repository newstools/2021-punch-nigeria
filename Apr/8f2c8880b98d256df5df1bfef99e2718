Following reports of students abduction across the country, Vice-Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Prof. Timothy Adebayo, has told the students of the institution not to leave the campus without permission. Adebayo in a statement expressed worry over the abduction and kidnapping of students across the country, saying that the university had decided to strictly monitor the movements of all the students, hence, there shouldn’t be unauthorised movements outside the campus. “With what is going on across the country, it appears nowhere is safe. Therefore, all our students should stay on campus. No student should go outside the campus without authorisation. “One of the advantages Ajayi Crowther University has is that we are fully residential. All of us are here on campus. Consequently, I don’t want any student to go outside this campus without taking permission. You must also wear your identity card always” “As the VC of this university, I am your father here on campus and I shall be held accountable for anything that happens to you. Therefore, I cannot pretend that all is well with this country regarding security, going by all the reports we read and hear. Let us corporate together and remain safe. Don’t flout this restriction of movement order,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
