Polytechnic lecturers have said they will continue with their ongoing strike, despite the promise by the Federal Government to release N15bn to them for infrastructural revitalisation. The National President, Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, Anderson Ezeibe, who spoke at a press briefing in Abuja, stated that the strike would be sustained until the grey details in the offer were sorted out in the coming weeks. The union commenced an indefinite strike on April 6, demanding implementation of a new salary scheme for polytechnic lecturers, revitalisation of the dilapidated state of polytechnics, and implementation of new national minimum wage, among others. ASUP had explained its decision to down tools was to draw the attention of the government to the nine basic needs of the union. But giving an update on the industrial action on Friday, Ezeibe said, “Our union received offers from the government during the meetings for the release of an infrastructural revitalisation fund of N15bn for the sector and this is in lieu of the NEEDS Assessment report of 2014. “Following the consideration of the offers as presented, the National Executive Council of our union yesterday resolved to sustain the strike action until the unresolved details in the offer as presented are sorted out in the meetings expected in the coming days.” Ezeibe further noted that two out of three scheduled meetings with the Federal Government were held and some of the demands met, including the release of 10 months’ salary arrears for members among others. The demands met also included the reconstitution and inauguration of the governing council of all federal polytechnics, which were dissolved in 2020. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
