Nigerian wrestler, Odunayo Adekuoroye, says she is confident of winning a medal for the country at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Olympics, which was originally scheduled for July 24 to August 9, 2020 was postponed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, and will now hold from July 23 to August 8, 2021. African champion Adekuoroye is a beneficiary of the Adopt-An-Athlete initiative of the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare, and is hopeful having got the desired support from the ministry and preparing under the conditions for the Tokyo Games. “I’m preparing well, focused and ready to do the needful that will place me on the podium at the Olympics. I’m ready and working hard on the weak areas, while also strengthening the strong ones,” Adekuoroye told The PUNCH. “Very soon I will be competing in Poland, which will count on my ranking at the Olympics. There is also the Spanish Grand Prix and other competitions. “Right now I am doing my build-up and strength training. By the grace of God, I’m 100 per cent sure that I will be on the podium.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
