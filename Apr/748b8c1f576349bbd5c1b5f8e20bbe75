The Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, SAN, has said all the money recovered by the commission are paid into the coffers of the Federal Government. Owasanoye, who appeared before the Senate Committee on Finance, investigating the activities of revenue-generating agencies of the government in Abuja, told the committee that the ICPC had no retention powers over funds or assets recovered from corrupt people. He said the commission had a designated account for the recovery of proceeds of crime called, ‘ICPC Recovery Account,’ into which all recovered funds were deposited for payment into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federal Government. “ICPC was not contemplated as a revenue-generating agency. In the course of our work, we do recover funds; however, ICPC does not spend recovered assets,” Owasanoye said. The ICPC Chairman added that the commission had helped to boost the tax revenue of the government by bringing defaulters to book. He said, “When we investigate, we also look at the tax components and bring defaulters into the tax net which goes to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.” The Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Solomon Adeola, expressed concern over Nigeria’s national budget, saying it was becoming too dependent on loans partly due to the non-compliance with financial regulations by government revenue-generating agencies. Adeola said the purpose of the hearing was to ensure that all government revenue-generating agencies complied with the Fiscal Responsibility Act which stipulated that 80 per cent of operational surplus be paid into the CRF.
