Four people, including a traditional ruler, have been killed by suspected herdsmen in separate attacks on two local government areas of Benue State. Two people were reportedly killed in Guma and another two in Makurdi LGAs. It was gathered that the traditional ruler, Chief Hyacinth Ajon, and a man, Benjamin Anakula, were killed on Wednesday in Tse Zoola, in the Makurdi council. The two other people were also killed on Wednesday in the Mbayer-Yandev in the Guma LGA. Governor Samuel Ortom paid a condolence visit to Tse Zoola where the monarch was killed n Wednesday. The eldest man in the community, Pa Aho Zoola told him, “The armed herdsmen attacked villagers around 2am, when the people were fast asleep, and killed two people.” He added that the attack was carried out by the suspected herders without any provocation. Aho said the community had never rustled the herdsmen’s cows, adding that his people had never had any issues with the herdsmen even when their herds graze on their crops. The governor, who sympathised with the villagers, promised that he would get security agents deployed in the area. Meanwhile, Chairman of Guma LGA, Caleb Aba, who confirmed the attack on Mbayer-Yandev, told journalists on the phone that the incident occurred at about 8pm on Wednesday. “Fulani herdsmen invaded Mbayer-Yandev, killing two persons and injuring three others.” The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, could not be reached at the time of this report.
