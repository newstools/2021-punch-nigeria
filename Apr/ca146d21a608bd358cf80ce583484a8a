The Akwa Ibom State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria has commended the state governor, Udom Emmanuel, for inaugurating laudable projects and programmes in the state. In a statement on Monday, CAN noted that it was imperative to commend the governor on what he had achieved since he assumed office in order to encourage him to do more. The statement read in part, “The administration of Governor Emmanuel has touched virtually all sectors of the state’s economy including aviation, commerce, agriculture, sports, industrialisation as well as provision of infrastructural facilities across the length and breadth of the state. “So, it is imperative that the landmarks recorded under Emmanuel be so recognised, in order to give him the fillip to do even more before handing over the baton come 2023.” According to the statement, the association further gave their support to the governor on other unfinished projects in the state.
