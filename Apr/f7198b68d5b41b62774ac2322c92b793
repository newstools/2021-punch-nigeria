Barely 24 hours after one of its commanders, Ikonso, was killed by security operatives in Imo State, the Indigenous People of Biafra has appointed a replacement The Media and Publicity Secretary to the group, Emmanuel Powerful, made this known during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. Powerful also distanced the group from an attack on the country home of Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma. He, however, refused to mention the name of the newly-appointed commander when asked. “They can say whatever they like, but we are intact. Another commander has taken over. I won’t tell you (the name),” he said. On possible reasons why Ikonso was killed, the IPOB spokesperson alleged, “Yesterday (Saturday), our commander went to his village. They ambushed him with some politicians … they ordered the military to kill him. Imo State administrator knows very that he has committed a crime and we must follow him up. “He ordered for the killing of this guy (the late commander) because he refused his offer to come and head the Ebubeagu which the South-East governors established. “He (the governor) sent some people to meet him (the late commander), but the guy refused that he cannot betray Biafra’s agitation and our leader – Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Since then, they have been threatening him. “In Imo State, they arrested more than 50 people … they have been going to people’s houses to arrest them; in Anambra, they arrested so many people; in Abia, they arrested so many people.” He clarified that neither IPOB nor the Eastern Security Network was responsible for the attack on Uzodinma’s residence. “They are liars, and they are not saying the truth. They don’t want to tell the citizens that Nigeria is almost collapsing, and IPOB has decided that nothing will stop them to back out on this course for Biafra restoration. “We are planning to get Biafra, but God knows the time. Anybody can say whatever he or she likes, it does not concern us,” he added.
