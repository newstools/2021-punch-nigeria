At least, one policeman was feared killed by gunmen who raided Onueke community in the Ezza South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, on Tuesday. Also, no fewer than three civilians were reportedly shot and dispossessed of their valuables by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the busy Onueke town at about 3.15pm, on Tuesday. The policeman, who was killed, PUNCH Metro gathered, alongside his colleagues, were trying to repel the hoodlums who held the town hostage for more than an hour, but was unluckily shot dead by the hoodlums. The gunmen were said to have first attacked a residence of a native doctor identified as Azuoba, near the ongoing airport project of Ebonyi state government, where they allegedly damaged vehicles and other property in his compound. Thereafter, they trailed another person to a new generation bank at Onueke and shot him. The victim whose name could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, was said to have gone to the bank to cash money he sold a piece of land when the attackers tracked him down. The rampaging hoodlums who were said to be about six in number, according to sources, proceeded to the Onueke main town, where they robbed a fuel station, beer dealers, PoS operator and others of their monies and other valuables. Although, some persons from the area, who spoke to our correspondent, on condition of anonymity, said two policemen were killed. But the State Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace, Hon Stanley Okoro Emegha, confirmed that only one policeman was killed, in the attack. He, however, said the robbery attack had nothing to do with the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra. Efforts to reach the Ebonyi State Police command to speak on the matter, as of the time of filing this report, failed.
