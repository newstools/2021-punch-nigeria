A US-based Nigerian man, Joseph Nantomah, claims to have prevented an American woman from getting defrauded of $32,000. In a video uploaded to his @theblackmentor_’s Instagram page on Wednesday, Nantomah, standing by the woman whom he identified as “Leen”, explained how he prevented a Nigerian cyber-crime syndicate from extorting her. Nantomah claimed that the cyber-fraudsters had tricked Keen into transferring $32,000 to his business account, with the mind that he would send them the money. He said that he had involved the police and embarked on a three-hour drive from Wisconsin to Indiana in a bid to locate Keen and help return her money. “Today, Wednesday, April 28, 2021, I drove 7 hours back and forth to expose a scam syndicate from Nigeria who defrauded this woman $32,000 of her life savings. They defrauded got the money and sent it into my bank account. I refused to remit it to them but took out time to drive from Wisconsin to Indiana to look for the rightful owner of the money after I had involved the police,” Nantomah wrote as the caption to the uploaded video. It appears that Nantomah was intended to serve as a “picker,” a term for strategic middle-men contacts for “Yahoo boys”, who are sometimes residents in the United States or other countries where victims reside. In many cases, pickers could be unaware of their role in the rip-off scheme until they receive money in their bank account. When asked by one Instagram user how the scammers had gotten hold of his business account, Nantomah said, “They pretended they wanted to do business with my Nigerian business partner who gave it to them without my consent”.
