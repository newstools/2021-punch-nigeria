There might be a clash in the future between reigning UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman and Conor McGregor after both superstars reignited their rivalry on social media on Monday. Usman defended his welterweight title for the fourth time with a second round knockout victory over Jorge Masvidal at the UFC 261 at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday in front of 15,000 screaming fans. McGregor has created a knack for taunting Usman after every win the Nigerian records, claiming he will one day come for the title in the welterweight division. The Irish fighter, in a post on Twitter, accused Usman of copying his moves in knocking out Masvidal, stating that he would destroy the Nigerian when they clash. “Usman even copied my shots now. Am I to fight this guy at some stage? I think so. Can’t be copying my words and my shots and not get a smack for it. I like 170. It’s mine soon,” McGregor tweeted. In his reply, Usman referred to the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion as a washed out fighter who got beaten easily in his preferred weight class. “Except when I touch you at 170, they go out. They don’t even go out at 155 anymore for you. I finish people. You get finished,” Usman tweeted. “I offered you the fight and you went missing. Let’s stay humble young man. I already took your pride. Don’t make me take your whiskey too,” the ‘Nigerian Nightmare’ added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
