The acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered the posting of CP Christopher Owolabi as the new Commissioner of Police in charge of Anambra State Police Command. According to the force spokesman, Frank Mba, the deployment of the new CP was part of the ongoing efforts at re-ordering, overhauling and strengthening the security and policing architecture in Anambra and other states of the South-East and South-South geo-political zones. This, he added, was designed to improve the operational efficiency of the commands and enhance public safety and security. Mba, in a statement on Friday, explained that Owolabi takes over from CP Monday Kuryas, who has been redeployed to the Anti-Fraud Section of the Force Headquarters Annex, Lagos. The IGP has also ordered the posting of other strategic and tactical commanders within the zones. A total of two Deputy Commissioners of Police, 14 Assistant Commissioners of Police and other mid-level officers were affected. The statement read, “The Inspector-General of Police charged the new Commissioner of Police  in Anambra State to take adequate measures in consolidating and improving on the gains of his predecessor. He further charged the CP to rejig the security apparatus of the state, harness the full potential of the command — its workforce, assets and stakeholders — in advancing the collective safety of all citizens.” He equally urged the people of the South-East and the South-South zones to cooperate with the police and other security agencies to enable them to succeed “in the responsibilities of safeguarding them and the common wealth of the nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
