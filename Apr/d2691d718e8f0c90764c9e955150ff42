American singer, Willow Smith, has revealed that she is polyamorous. The singer and daughter of popular film producer, Will Smith, made this known during Wednesday episode of the ‘Red Table Talk’, an original Facebook watch show. Polyamory is the act of having romantic relationships with multiple partners, with the consent of all parties involved. Willow Smith co-hosts the show with her mother, Jada Pinkett; and maternal grandmother, Adrienne Bannfield. Willow disclosed her polyamory status during questions from her mother and grandmother concerning her relationship choice. Her grandmother had said, “For somebody like me, it feels like it’s really all just centered around sex,” though she admitted to having considered it herself. However, 20-year-old Willow revealed that polyamory was more about freedom than about sex. According to her, “With polyamory, I feel like the main foundation is the freedom to be able to create a relationship style that works for you and not just stepping into monogamy because that’s what everyone around you says is the right thing to do.” Willow further revealed that the main cause for divorces in marriages is infidelity and she sees polyamory as a better option.
