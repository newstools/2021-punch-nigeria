THE Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has described the continued stay of the controversial Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isah Pantami, in the cabinet of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as absurd and ludicrous. The body also noted that the defence of the minister by the Buhari-led regime indicated that the government was unserious about its fight against insecurity and Boko Haram insurgency. The PFN, in a statement by its President, Bishop Wale Oke, on Monday signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Bishop Emmah Isong, said Pantami should have resigned or get sacked on account of his antecedent. The statement read, “That Pantami is still in Buhari’s government tells much about who we are and the mockery that trails us. What is the man still doing in government? Why has he not resigned or why has he not been sacked? “We want to urge President Buhari to rise above primordial sentiments and sectional attachments in dealing with the issue at hand. Frankly speaking, it’s no longer at ease for the nation and its people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
