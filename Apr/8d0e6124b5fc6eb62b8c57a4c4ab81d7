The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, has approved the renaming of the ongoing counterinsurgency operation in the North-East from Operation Lafiya Dole to Operation Hadin Kai, the Nigerian Army has said. This was contained in statement on Friday signed by Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima. The statement was titled, ‘Nigerian Army Renames Operation In The North East, Seeks Inclusiveness’. It read, “The Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru has approved the renaming of the ongoing Counterinsurgency Operation in the North East from Operation Lafiya Dole to Operation Hadin Kai. “This is premised on the fact that the Nigerian Army has made a lot of progress over the years and needs to re-align for better efficiency. “Also affected in the re-designation are the Army Super Camps which now reflect the nomenclature of the formations and units followed by the name of the locations they occupy while sub-units are redesigned as Forward Operating Bases followed by the name of their locations. All these changes are with immediate effect. “The renaming is in line with the COAS Vision of having ‘A Nigerian Army that is Repositioned to Professionally Defeat all Adversaries in a Joint Environment’. “It is the belief of the COAS that the complete defeat of insurgency is a process that requires the participation of the entire nation using all elements of national power. “He further assured that the NA under his leadership will continue to pursue the path of jointness in prosecuting the counterinsurgency war.” Operation Lafiya Dole came into being as a result of the dastard killings and horrible crimes perpetually perpetrated by Islamist terrorist sect, Boko Haram. While the Army and the Presidency keep claiming the group has been ‘technically defeated’ and ‘weakened’, the Abubakar Shekau’s bloodthirsty faction continues to strike with daring effrontery and crude savagery.
