The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday charged the head of agencies and government-owned companies on quality performance. Sanwo-Olu, who noted that some agencies are bigger than some ministries, urged all the heads of parastatals to work together as a team to achieve quality performance. The governor, according to a statement, stated this at a media parley at the state House, Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “You must work as a team because you all have a role to play in good governance in Lagos State. There is no one who is irreplaceable. You should always do a self appraisal of yourself and if you don’t have two or three people that can replace you, then you haven’t done enough. “There are those who believe that we can do it, make Lagos better than the way we met it, we must go out to do it and not disappoint them.” The state Deputy Governor, Obafemi Hamzat, said the vision of the state was to become a model city, urged the head of agencies to relate with one another in other to succeed. The Managing Director  of Complete Football and Complete Sports, Dr Mumini Alao, in his presentation, noted that government parastatals could be likened to a football team where each one had a role to play in delivering good governance to the people.
