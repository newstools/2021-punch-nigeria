Barely four weeks that a section of the Delta State police headquarters was gutted by fire, another section of the headquarters on Thursday was engulfed by fire. PUNCH Metro gathered that the fire, which razed the control room of the command around 2 pm, caused panic among police officers and passersby. The fire was said to have destroyed properties with millions of naira at the police headquarters. When contacted, the acting Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Bright Edafe, confirmed the fire incident. The acting PPRO said, “Yes, there was fire but it only affected a section of the control room and had been put out. “It is an electrical fault that caused it, it only affected a part of the control room. There is no fire without damages, part of the room was damaged.” A part of the car park of the command was also razed a few weeks ago.
