The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has announced the approval of Pfizer-BionTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in Nigeria. The announcement was made at the agency headquarters in Lagos on Friday by NAFDAC Director-General, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye. According to her, the approval given was not a full one but it would be in effect within the period of getting people vaccinated and gathering data about the adverse effects following immunisation. The NAFDAC boss also revealed that the agency relied on a more mature regulatory body for its approval, adding that that the agency was at liberty to review its stance since the World Health Organisation had given emergency use listing. Adeyeye said, “The purpose of the press briefing is to announce that NAFDAC has just approved Pfizer-BionTech vaccines for possible use in Nigeria. “They were reviewed carefully by the NAFDAC staff COVID-19 vaccine committee to make sure that the science behind the development is well understood and in accord with our world regulatory activities. “We used different mechanisms to approve the vaccine. We used reliance, meaning that a more mature regulatory agency across the globe, we can use that as a basis for our review. “We will get the assessment report, know the peculiarity there, then our COVID-19 committee will get to do their job.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that NAFDAC approved AstraZeneca vaccine for use in Nigeria.
