Two students of Osogbo Government Technical College, and one from Osogbo Grammar School, were on Tuesday arrested for their involvement in violent clashes. The three schoolboys were reportedly picked up around Old Garage, Osogbo by some members of Hunters Group of Nigeria. Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that students of the two schools had clashed near the schools after school hour. It was learnt that the fight reportedly spilled to other parts of the state capital before the security agents could nip it in the bud. When contacted, Special Adviser to the governor on Education, Mr. Jamiu Olawumi, confirmed the arrest of the students. Olawumi said, “Any student that behaves in a manner inimical to the peace of the society, school or his fellow students would face the law of the state. So, people who were using dangerous weapons on themselves, three of them have been arrested and will be charged to court. “If they are minors, they will face juvenile court and if they are adults, they will face regular court and will be dealt with, accordingly. We will not tolerate nonsense from anybody. We will not condone indiscipline in our schools. “They have been arrested by the police, the CP is on top of the situation and I am assuring you, they will face the consequences.”
