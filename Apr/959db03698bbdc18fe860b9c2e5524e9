Registrar of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply Management of Nigeria, Mr  Mohammed Aliyu,  has said procurement professionals has not accorded the necessary recognition they deserved by the Nigerian government officials. Aliyu made this known at the induction ceremony of 294 members which took place in Lagos on Saturday. Aliyu said, “Unfortunately many people think of procurement profession too narrowly and regarded it as not more than clerical work or comprising of only the store keeping, issuing pencil and biro. Perhaps that is why the professionals  are not accorded the necessary recognition it deserved in development equation by Nigerian government officials.” He also listed three reasons procurement was essential for development, saying the public procurement was not among the most popular topics in development equation of many entities. “Without efficient procurement, money gets wasted on a very large scale. Many developing countries channel significant proportions of their budgets through the procurement system, even marginal savings can add up very fast, likewise, public procurement is a part of the government that citizens see every day.” “Lack of inauguration of Public Procurement Council is affecting the totality of objectives of government in that direction. “Another problem facing the institute is proper domestication of the institute’s certificate in the scheme of service of the federation which is an important issues for consideration by objective observers of this great country,” Aliyu said. President of CIPSMN, Mr Jubrin Ado congratulated the inductees and charged them to be dedicated, hardworking and honest in their endeavors.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
