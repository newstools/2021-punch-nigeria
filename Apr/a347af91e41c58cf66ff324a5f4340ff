Nigerian airline, Air Peace, has failed to commence catering services one month after the Federal Government ordered all local airlines to begin to do so. Local airlines had last year suspended catering services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was made in order to discourage passengers from taking off their face masks. However, the Minister of Aviation, Captain Hadi Sirika, had on March 22, 2021, asked all airlines to resume catering services. Checks by The PUNCH showed that Arik Air, Aero Contractors, and Dana Air have all complied with the directive. The airlines, it was observed, handed out snacks and meals to passengers disembarking the planes after landing. However, it was observed that Air Peace had not begun serving in-flight meals. Attempts to get a response from the airline failed as its Spokesman, Stanley Olisa, neither responded to repeated calls nor a text message on Wednesday.
