The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board on Sunday announced the rescheduling of its 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination to May 20, 2021. The organization said the change of date was due to some ongoing adjustments in its operational processes. A statement by the Head of Public Affairs and Protocol in JAMB, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, however, said it would not affect the other schedules, including the date for the UTME fixed for between June 5 and 19 2021. The statement read, “The 2021 mock examination earlier scheduled to hold on Saturday, April 30, 2021, has now been rescheduled to hold on Thursday, May 20, 2021. “This change of date is owing to some ongoing adjustments in the Board’s operational processes. The change, however, would not affect the mock examination and other schedules including the date for the UTME fixed for June 5 to 19 June, 2021. Candidates who have registered and have chosen to sit the mock and other critical stakeholders are to note this change of date. “Similarly, it is necessary to inform all stakeholders that the 2021 UTME/DE registration exercise is ongoing and it is to end on May 15 2021. The Board has, however, noted with concern that some candidates in trying to generate their profiles are sending their details wrongly to 55019. “The right process is to send the word “NIN” allow one space in between, then insert the eleven digits NIN number to 55019 e.g. NIN 00000000000. Any other process is wrong and would not generate the profile code for the candidate. “It is also necessary for the candidate to know that only the SIM that is linked to his/her NIN can be used to send the NIN to 55019.”
