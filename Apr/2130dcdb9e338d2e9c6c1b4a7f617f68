The immediate past President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, has advised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and the All Progressives Congress to seek help in addressing Nigeria’s security problems. Saraki urged the president to call a meeting of former Presidents, security chiefs and all those who had something to offer in order to curtail the nation’s slide into chaos. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Insecurity: Saraki Advises Buhari to Call for Help’, which he signed in Abuja, on Tuesday. Saraki said, “It is obvious that President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC government need help. They have been overwhelmed by the situation and they sure need assistance from all. “Thus, I urge Mr. President to seek help wherever it can be given. This matter has gone beyond what the government can handle alone. The President should know that calling for help in our present situation is not a sign of weakness.” Saraki, further said, “Just as I stated in my press statement on the same issue on January 24, 2021, I want to reiterate that the President needs to bring together all former Presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand.” Copyright PUNCH.
