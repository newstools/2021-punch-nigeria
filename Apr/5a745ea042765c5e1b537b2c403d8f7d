The Lagos State House of Assembly says it will regulate the administration of cooperative societies and address the challenges faced by members. The Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Industry and Cooperative, Bisi Yusuff, noted that stakeholders at a public hearing identified the challenges ranging from non-adherence to the provisions of the existing law by the operator, financial impropriety with impunity, fraud, as well as inadequate statutory sanctions for defaulters. Yusuff said this during the presentation of the report on a ‘Bill for a Law to Provide for the Registration of Cooperative Societies in Lagos State and Connected Matters. He said, “After thorough deliberation and consultations from different stakeholders, the committee recommended that a registered society shall not grant a loan to any person who is not a member of the society. “Also, the management committee of a registered society shall constitute from among its members a seven-man electoral committee to organise elections of officers for the registered society; the accounts of a registered society shall be audited by an auditor selected from the approved list of auditors; all money lying unclaimed shall be deposited in the state treasury among others.” Copyright PUNCH.
