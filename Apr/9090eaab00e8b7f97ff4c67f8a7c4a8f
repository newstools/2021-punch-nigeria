THE management of Eastern Palm University, Ogboko, has announced the shutting down of the institution with immediate effect. The institution, which was established during the administration of Rochas Okorocha, is located in Ideato South Local Government Area. The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Tola Badejo, who briefed journalists in Owerri, the state capital, on Wednesday, said the decision was taken to safeguard the lives of the students and staff as well as the properties of the varsity. The Professor of Zoology disclosed that the institution took the decision following the ownership crisis between Rochas Okorocha and the state government. He said, “The recent visit by the Imo State Commissioner for Education ordering the students to leave the premises was unsettling for the institution. “The recent removal of the university’s entrance billboard by the Imo State Government and its replacement with the proposed renamed K. O. Mbadiwe University by staff of the government aided by armed policemen is simply one action too many. “All students and parents are urged to contact the Registrar’s office in order to gain better insight and support during this period. Creating a healthy and conducive environment for learning is key to our operations at Eastern Palm University and as such a parameter we cannot trade.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
