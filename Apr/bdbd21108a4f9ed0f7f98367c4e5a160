KANO State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, on Thursday described corruption as a menace killing the fabrics of Nigeria, stressing that the country was doomed if nothing was done to stem the ugly trend. Ganduje made these remarks on Thursday while inaugurating the state Anti-Corruption Strategy Steering Committee of the Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission in Kano. The governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, said it was the most important committee to be inaugurated in the fight against corruption. “It is only in Kano that anti-corruption campaign works like the one established at the federal level. I remember vividly that two state commissioners and Permanent Secretaries lost their positions due to the operations of the Anti-Corruption Commission. “It means that there is no sacrificial lamb as whoever is found wanting is dealt with accordingly. That clearly indicates that the state anti-corruption body is working. Believe it or not, corruption is killing all of us,” the governor said. Ganduje lauded the efforts of the current Executive Chairman of the anti-graft commission, Mr. Muhuyi Rimingado, towards eliminating corruption, observing that he was making headway. Earlier, Rimingado reiterated the resolve of the commission to make Kano a corruption-free state, promising that he would not be deterred in his determination to fight corruption to a standstill.
