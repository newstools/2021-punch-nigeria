Unknown gunmen have again killed about five soldiers in Omelema community, Abia Local Government Area of Rivers State. It was gathered that the gunmen came from a nearby river, shot indiscriminately, and went straight to a lodge where the soldiers were camped and opened fire, killing two on the spot about 11pm on Monday. The latest attack is coming barely 48 hours after gunmen suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra attacked some security checkpoints, killing eight operatives. The spokesman for the 6 Division, Nigeria Army Port Harcourt, Major Charles Ekeocha, was yet to comment on the incident as he was not answering his calls as of the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, all heads of security agencies on Monday morning held a security meeting at the headquarters of the State Police Command along Moscow Road in Port Harcourt.
