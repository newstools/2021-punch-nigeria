THE Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, has assured organised labour that the current administration will continue to ensure the autonomy of the local government areas in the state. He said this in Yenagoa, while receiving the National President of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, Akeem Olatunji-Ambali, who paid him a courtesy call at the Government House, Yenagoa, on Wednesday. Ewhrudjakpo also explained that Bayelsa was one of the few states in the country where other arms of government were given a free hand to perform their constitutionally assigned duties. This was contained in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Doubara Atasi, on Thursday. He explained that the state government recently resolved to increase its financial support to the councils with an additional N252m monthly. Ewhrudjakpo said, “We have not only exercised autonomy for our local government system here, but also addressed several issues people are protesting for elsewhere. In Bayelsa, we have autonomy for the Judiciary since 2013 and the House of Assembly in 2019. “Bayelsa State is one state where we don’t tamper with local government funds. As the funds come, the chairmen meet with the state at the Joint Allocation Committee, and what we do is to approve the JAC figures and they go back to dispense.” Copyright PUNCH.
