Hoodlums on Monday night attacked the Federal High Court in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, burning some sections of the building. Two security guards were also injured during the attack that was said to have occurred around 1am. It was gathered that the hoodlums, who reportedly scaled the court perimeter fence to carry out the attack, used a petrol bomb to perpetrate the act. The court’s library and the security post were badly torched. Our correspondent who visited the court on Tuesday morning sighted a detachment of policemen with three patrol vehicles stationed at strategic positions within the court area. Efforts to gain access to the court premises failed as the security guards said the Registrar instructed them not to allow non-staff into the court premises. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident. Odah said the hoodlums came in large numbers and set a section of the court ablaze. She, however, said that firefighters quickly intervened and quenched the fire. “Yes, last night, hoodlums came in their large numbers and set a section of the court ablaze but firefighters promptly came and quenched the fire,” Odah said.
