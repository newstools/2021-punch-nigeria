The Chief Judge of Katsina State, Justice Musa- Danladi Abubakar, has granted bail to 256 offenders and released seven others in correctional centers in the state. Justice Abubakar told journalists after the exercise on Monday that he embarked on the visitation to correctional centers across the state with a view to decongesting them and enabling the facilities to have manageable space in compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. Beneficiaries of the chief judge’s gesture included the aged, those with serious health challenges, and those who displayed good character and industry while in custody. In his remarks, the Controller of Corrections, Katsina State Command, Muhammad Haruna, commended the Chief Judge for the exercise, saying that decongesting the custodial facilities would enable the Service to perform its statutory duties of “reforming, rehabilitating and reintegrating the inmates back to the society as law-abiding citizens.” The Controller advised those who regained their freedom and those granted bail to be of good character and refrain from criminal activities. Recall that a similar exercise was conducted in 2020 following the directive of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, and Hon. Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation towards curtailing the spread of the pandemic, as well as the directives to the Heads of Courts to decongest overcrowded correctional centers.
