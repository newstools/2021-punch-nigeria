THE Nigerian Medical Association, Katsina branch, has given out free JAMB registration forms to 63 kidnapped but rescued students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. The state NMA chairman, Dr.Abubakar Dahiru, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Katsina. He said the association presented the forms to the students on Monday through the state Science and Technical Education Board. He explained that while some of the students, who were in Katsina received the JAMB forms on Monday, arrangements had been made to ensure that the rest in Kankara receive theirs at schedule time. The NMA chairman said the association made the donation to further encourage the students and put the last December abduction incident behind them. The Executive Secretary, Alhaji Lawal Bosa, who received the JAMB forms on behalf of the students, lauded the NMA for the gesture, promising that all the beneficiaries would receive the forms. Recall that bandits last December abducted 344 students from the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. The students were rescued after six days in the banditsâ€™ captivity. Copyright PUNCH.
