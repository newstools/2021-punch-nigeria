A non-governmental organisation in Imo State, Ezelukwu Ventures Nigeria Ltd has announced plans to begin a full scale mechanised farming in the South-East. The NGO said the merchanised  farming, in collaboration with Justcorn Agricultural Development Service, would boost food production, engage youths in  gainful  employment and generate raw materials. The managing director of the NGO, Chief Austine Nnodim, who spoke in Owerri on Thursday, said the organisation had already acquired over 21,000 hectares of land in the Southeast for the proposed project. He said the inauguration of the project had been slated to take place by the end of April. He added that the organisations had entered into agreement with the indigenes of Umulolo and Agbaobu communities in the Okigwe council area of the state to ensure the success of the project. Nnodim said a steering committee on the project from the Okigwe LGA headed by Dr Charles Umezuruike had been inaugurated with Fabian Nwosu as the liaison officer covering the two host communities of Umulolo and Agbaobu. Given the size of the land acquired for the project and the area of coverage in the Southeast, Nnodim said within the first year of operation, the organisation hoped to generate at least 2,000 job opportunities. According to him, the organisation would massively produce cassava. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
