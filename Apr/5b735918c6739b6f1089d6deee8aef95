UNEASY calm has enveloped Ebonyi State following the shooting of two soldiers and a civilian at a checkpoint in the state. The incident, which occurred on Monday night, revealed that gunmen shot the two soldiers and the civilian at a checkpoint on the Timber Shade Junction area in the Afikpo North Local of the state. The PUNCH gathered that the gunmen attacked the soldiers at about 8.48pm on Monday and carted away their rifles. A community source, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen arrived at the checkpoint in a white bus and opened fire when the military men stopped them for a search. According to him, the situation threw the two busy towns of Amasiri and Afikpo into panic, as natives especially petty traders hurriedly packed their goods and went home. “As usual, it appeared the military were checking them and all of a sudden, they opened fire on them. Two of the military men, a man and woman, died. Others ran away. “The area is as quiet as the graveyard. These bordering villages used to be very busy and people here are farmers and traders. But the moment that happened, people started going home. “Nobody is seen outside as I speak to you. Every place is calm. There is fear here now. My brother, the world is about to end,” the source said. A reliable security source confirmed the incident at the time of filing this report, saying the Army Commandant in the state would never say anything now until he got approval from the headquarters. It was gathered that the Divisional Police Officer of Afikpo North Division, who was said to be aware of the incident, had yet to notify the Public Relations Department of the Ebonyi State Police Command.
