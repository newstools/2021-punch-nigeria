IN what seems to be an ethnic cleansing in Nasarawa State, suspected herdsmen have again launched an attack on three Tiv farmers in the Keana Local Government Area of the state. The latest killings came after they (herdsmen) allegedly murdered 11 farmers in Ajimaka community in the Doma LGA last Saturday. The Chairman of Ate U Tiv, “Unity Forum” in the state, Barnard Ikyeghna, made the disclosure while speaking with newsmen in Lafia on Wednesday. “Two other deaths have been recorded in Keana LGA while another man was macheted yesterday (Tuesday) and he is currently receiving treatment in one of the hospitals in the state. “The victims are Sebastine Agbaka, an undergraduate of Nasarawa State University, Keffi, who was murdered on Monday in Kadarko and in Doshima village, one Mr Fidelis Abanka has been declared missing since herdsmen stormed his house on Monday night and took him away. “Mr Andrew Yough is in a critical condition in the hospital now because he was attacked and severely injured by the herdsmen with a machete,” he said. Ikyeghna said the reason for the attacks on Tiv communities in the state was because of the implementation of the anti-open grazing law by the state government. “The government should come to our aide because we are under siege at the moment. We are peace – loving people and they should stop attacking our people for things we know nothing about it”, he lamented Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
