The Cross River State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Emmanuel Hart, has restated the commitment of the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct credible and transparent election. This, he said, would be done by increasing polling units nationwide. Hart gave the assurances on Tuesday in Calabar, the state capital, at the opening of a workshop on the implementation of expansion of voters’ access to polling units. He said, “The training is to equip the members of staff on the strategies to implement the voters’ access to polling units. “The expansion of polling units programme, which is meant to convert the existing voting points in the country to full-fledged polling units, will enhance more voter participation thereby reducing voter apathy in the electoral process.” Hart called for a successful execution of the assignment by the participants and expressed the hope that the implementation will bring to an end the challenges currently experienced during electoral processes. During the practical session, the commission’s Head of Operations, Mr Fred Emezu, lectured the participants on the objectives of the workshop while the trainer from INEC headquarters, Elizabeth Atte, trained them on the use of UTM Geo map for capturing new polling units and procedure for location and relocation of existing polling units.
