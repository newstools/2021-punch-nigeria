One of the monarchs in Ife East Local Government Area of Osun State, the Elerefe of Erefe, Oba Johnson Fayemi, has appealed to the state government to ensure an improved security at Oduduwa College, Ile Ife following the invasion of the school by some hoodlums. The monarch, who said this in an interview with our correspondent, noted that hoodlums were invading the school because of its location at the heart of the town and stealing valuable things there. Oba Fayemi, who was an old student of the college, spoke with our correspondent  on the sidelines of the donation of books, chairs and  desks to the school by the 1971/1975 set of students of the school. The monarch said, “My advice to the state government is that they should improve the security especially at the mega schools. The fence at Oduduwa College is not high and hoodlums do scale the fence to go in and steal laboratory apparatuses and other things. “We donated 100 custom built chairs and books to the students now, we are now thinking of buying what the hoodlums stole from the laboratory so that our students won’t be denied the opportunity of being taught science  practicals. “We cannot be buying the equipment  over and over, so we want government to do something about security there. They can even hire  vigilantes to guard the school.” The chairman planning committee of the set, Michael Onagbola, said, “ What should be the aim of the current students is to be better than all of us who have gone ahead of them.” The Principal of the school,  Mrs Kehihde Awoyeye,  lauded the old students for their love towards the school despite the economic hardship in the country.
