A faction has emerged within the Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. The faction, True Peoples Democratic Party, led by Alhaji Bilyaminu Badarawa, also announced the removal of the state party chairman, Alhaji Tukur Danfulani, and his executive members. Addressing a press conference in Gusau on Friday, Badarawa said, “It becomes imperative to form the True PDP in order to salvage the Peoples Democratic Party in Zamfara State from sinking and deterioration under its factional chairman, Alhaji Tukur Danfulani. “The PDP leadership in Zamfara State is not respecting the opinions of its members, elders and other patrons, which led it to lose its glory in the state. “The leadership’s selective justice and ‘I don’t care’ attitude to the plight of its members is another reason we decided to create a faction within the party.” Badarawa also expressed disappointment with the recent sacking of the party’s Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Faruku Rijiya, a situation he described as a lack of focus and capacity of the Danfulani leadership to lead the party. “As from today, April 30, 2021, I, as the coordinator, PDP Grassroots Mobilisation, Zamfara State, and the new chairman of the True PDP Zamfara State, hereby announce that Alhaji Tukur Danfulani and his executive members have been expelled from the party,” Badarawa said. Reacting to the development, the state PDP Secretary, Alhaji Ibrahim Umar, said he was not aware of the existence of a new faction of the party. “I am not aware of this faction. I am hearing this from you for the first time,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
