Olajide Samuel Actress, Debby Felix, has said that though she could not work during the COVID-19 lockdown, it was actually what transpired during the #EndSARS protests that affected her mental health. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, she said, “What affected my mental health was the #EndSARS protest. It was not even the pandemic. It affected me because I am a youth and I really don’t like where my country is at the moment. I loved the fact that we (youths) stood up and spoke out. At the beginning, it looked like we were going to get answers. But suddenly, they shot at us. I think we did well. There was nothing we did wrong. I don’t think we (youths) could have done anything better during the #EndSARS protests. We spoke up but we did not carry guns. It was actually hoodlums sent by people who wanted to scatter the protests that were killing people.” Sharing her thoughts on entertainers who engaged in social media rifts, the Royal Arts Academy-trained actress said, “If they feel that is what works for them, it’s okay. I don’t engage in controversies because I am a private person. I don’t judge anyone that is controversial on social media. I always tell people to keep their opinions to themselves; let people live their lives.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
