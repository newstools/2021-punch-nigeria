The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, has confirmed the presence of Boko Haram terrorists and the hoisting of their flag in Kaure, Shiroro Local Government Area. Abubakar Sani Bello made this known when he paid a visit to over 3,000 Internally Displaced Persons from Shiroro and Munya local government areas who are taking refuge in Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida Primary School, Minna the state capital. He said, “I am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements around Kaure in the Shiroro Local Government of Niger State. They have taken over the territory. They have hoisted their flag. I am confirming to you now that they have taken over the wives of people by force.” Bello, while describing the situation in the state as critical and pathetic, said over 3,000 villagers escaped to Minna on Sunday night alone, while several others were in camps in Gwada and other places. “The majority of the displaced persons will have to remain in this camp in Minna because their villages have been taken over by Boko Haram terrorists and bandits. Their wives have been seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram elements,” he said. He warned that the Boko Haram terrorists were trying to make Kaure their home and headquarters like they did in Sambisa forest, adding that while Sambisa forest is several kilometres away from Abuja, Kaure is only two hours drive to Abuja. He explained that his administration had been asking the Federal Government to come to the aid of the state in dealing with the insecurity, adding that such efforts had not yielded desired results thereby making it possible for the terrorists to occupy a part of the state. “I have not lost hope from the federal government but I am not waiting for anyone anymore”, he added.
