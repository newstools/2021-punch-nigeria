The Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has vowed to ensure that those who left the party at one point or another do not emerge as flag bearer for the November 6 governorship election. The state deputy chairman of the PDP, Okey Asolo, who stood in for the chairman, Ndubuisi Nwobu, said this during a worship conference of statutory delegates summoned by a PDP governorship aspirant, Dr Obiora Okonkwo. He said its standard bear in the election must be a person who was consistent. Asolo said, “We’ll endorse a party man in our primary election; somebody who has love for the party; somebody who has been consistent with our party; somebody who has helped to build the party in the state.  Not fair-weather political associates. We won’t give our ticket to serial defectors. “From what we hear about the 16 aspirants contesting the governorship on our party’s platform, some of them are fifth columnists working for our opponents. “They are into the race to destroy us. We know such aspirants and they can’t get our endorsement, no matter the inducement. “We have not seen some of such aspirants. It is time to think deep. Let’s not sell our consciences.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
