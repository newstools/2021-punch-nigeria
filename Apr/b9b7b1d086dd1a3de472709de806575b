The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has advocated the inclusion of provisions in the Constitution to guarantee a “more equal” society where both men and women can contribute to the country’s development. Gbajabiamila noted that doing so was the only way that Nigeria can achieve  its desired goals, adding that women in particular should be free to “pursue their highest aspirations and achieve their maximum potential.” The Speaker said this in Abuja on Thursday at the opening of a two-day retreat on ‘Achieving Gender Equity in the Constitution Review Process,’ according to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi. According to the statement titled, ‘Constitution review: Gbajabiamila seeks level playground for women, men…calls for provisions in the Electoral Act,’ the event was organised by the Office of the Speaker and the House Committee on Women Affairs in collaboration with the National Democratic Institute.
