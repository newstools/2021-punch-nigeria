The Managing Director of Nigerian Export Processing Zones, Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, has canvassed for the adoption of the export business accelerator programme by the Federal Government. The programme will enable the rapid integration of Nigeria’s Small and Medium Enterprises into the Special Economic Zones scheme thereby fostering economic growth. Adesugba said this while delivering a keynote address during the 2021 World Intellectual Property Day Symposium held virtually. He was quoted in a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by the Head, Corporate Communications, NEPZA, Martins Odeh, as saying “The management of NEPZA is willing to canvass the support and approval of Mr President for definite and sustainable initiatives that can help in the growth and development of the national economy through the robust participation of SMEs.” The NEPZA boss added that the authority was willing to partner with SMEDAN and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council to develop a joint SEZ programme for SMEs. “In line with our plans to develop sectorial SEZs for different industries such as medical SEZ, agro-allied, textile, etc. We may seek a strategic alliance with SMEDAN and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council to develop a joint SEZ program for SMEs,” he said. Adesugba cited Kenya as a good example of a country that had integrated its SMEs into the SEZ scheme through the export business accelerator programme. According to the NEPZA boss, now is the best time for nations and individuals to search for geniuses and ideas that can help transform the common loss caused by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to sustainable gains in all field of human endeavour, especially in the health and economic sectors among others.
