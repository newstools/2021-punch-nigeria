Motorcycle riders and members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers clashed at the Iyana-Iba-Ojo axis of Lagos State on Monday. The PUNCH gathered that during the incident, which happened near the Lagos State University, passers-by scampered to safety. An eyewitness, identified simply as Ibrahim, said the clash started around 08 am. He said, “The situation is due to a clash between motorcycle riders and members of the National Union of NURTW. The clash has spread to the Alaba-Rago area — directly opposite LASU — and the popular Volks bus stop. “The road is currently blocked, and unsafe for movement. Gunshots were also heard. “The clash ensued between Okada riders and NURTW workers. While discharging their ticketing duty, there was a disagreement between the duo that led to the death of one person. “Soldiers intervened to secure peace and dispersed them with tear gas but the aggrieved parties retreated, only for the Okada men to troop back to Volks to challenge the NURTW members.” Reacting, the Lagos State Police spokesperson, Adejobi Olumuyiwa, said normalcy has returned to the area. “Normalcy has been restored to Iyana Iba, Okokomaiko and the axis. We are on top of the situation. No ethnic colouration. Everyone should continue his or her business. No cause for alarm. We will update you with the details soon,” Olumuyiwa said.
