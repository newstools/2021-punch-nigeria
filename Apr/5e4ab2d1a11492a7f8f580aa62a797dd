The Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, on Friday, said the state government did not borrow to fund the state’s international passenger/cargo airport. In a veiled response to critics who alleged that the state borrowed billions of naira to build the airport, Obiano said the state was not indebted to anybody, including contractors, on the project. Obiano stated this during the test run of the inaugural commercial flight at the airport in Umueri, Anambra East Local Government Area of the state. The governor said the airport had provided 5,000 employment opportunities within 15 months, comprising 3,000 direct jobs and 2,000 indirect jobs. According to him, the airport will boost the economy of the state and that of the South-East region in general. He said the state government built the airport within 15 months and did not “borrow even a kobo to fund the project.” Obiano added, “The airport has a 5.7km runway, 400-passenger capacity and 11-storey tower. Our administration deliberately designed the airport to transform the state into a destination for local and international investors.” Two aircraft belonging to Air Peace, owned by an indigene of the state, Allen Onyema, were the first to land at the airport at 2.28pm and 2.47pm, respectively. Onyema commended the quality of facilities at the airport, expressing optimism that the Presidency would approve the airport as an international airport before long. Copyright PUNCH.
