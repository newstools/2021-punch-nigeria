A Science Laboratory Technology graduate of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomosho, Bukola Akinfenwa, has solicited support from members of the public to undergo chemotherapy. Akinfenwa was diagnosed with advanced left breast cancer at the UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Osun State, according to a medical pathology request form sighted by our correspondent on Monday. Her sister, Tolu, in an interview with our correspondent, said the family had spent a lot in managing her sister’s health condition. She said, “I appeal to well-meaning Nigerians to come to our aid; I believe my sister can recover from the ailment. We’ve spent almost all we have on her treatment. “We decided to move her from UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, to the University College Hospital, Ibadan because we are not happy with the attention being given to her at UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital. The rough estimate needed for the chemotherapy is N5m. We, therefore, solicit funds from members of the public.” Akinfenwa can be reached via her sister’s mobile phone number, 08030854226, while donations can be made into; Guarantee Trust Bank; Account number – 0036308542; Account name – Akinfenwa Grace Tolulope.
