A member of the Board of Trustees of the All Progressives Congress, Buba Galadima, has said the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, should face the consequences of his past actions. Pantami has been under fire following sermons he delivered in the past which had him allegedly sympathising with the terror groups – Al-Qaeda and Taliban – a thing he says he has repented of.

He did that at a certain period, and now he’s reaping the fruit of it because he has been recognised and given an appointment. Now that his past was bad, it is important that he faces his own music.” He continued, “Pantami has already admitted his crime. So, there is no need even to investigate anything because he has already admitted, he has apologised. Whether the apology is good enough to exonerate him, that I wouldn’t know.” READ ALSO: Pantami: Buhari has shown view on terrorism, says Ezekwesili Galadima faulted the Federal Government for standing in support of Pantami on claims that he has apologised for his past statement. He said, “If anybody commits an offence, apologises and is set free, then let the federal government today release Jolly Nyame and Chief Dariye of Plateau State. They have been jailed despite having remorse in court. Why can’t the federal government release them? Or those that are being interrogated for theft, they should be let off the hook if they apologise.” READ ALSO: How CCTV facilitated Nollywood actor, Baba Ijesha’s arrest for defiling minor
