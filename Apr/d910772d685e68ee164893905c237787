Serbian coach, Dejan Arsov, will be in the dugout for Al Ahly Benghazi against Enyimba when both sides clash in a CAF Confederation Cup tie at the Martyrs of February Stadium Thursday (today). Arsov, who missed the team’s double-header against Orlando Pirates on April 4 and 11 due to COVID-19, has recovered in time for the match against the Nigerian giants. The former Red Star Belgrade academy manager’s COVID-19 results returned positive on April 3 along with that of youngster Moaz Sheikhi, but according to a statement by the club, the coach has resumed training with the players and will be available for the tie. “The coach of our first football team, Dejan Arsov, has recovered from coronavirus, after his negative survey a little while ago,” the club wrote on Twitter. The game, which was earlier scheduled to hold Wednesday, had been moved to Thursday (today) after Enyimba initially found it difficult securing a flight to Libya. Copyright PUNCH.
