Men of the Ondo State Police Command are combing the forest off the Ikaramu-Akunnu Akoko Road in the Akoko North West Local Government Area of the state to rescue three construction workers, who were kidnapped on Tuesday by gunmen. It was gathered that the construction workers, whose identities had not been ascertained as of the time of filing this report, were rehabilitating the Ikaramu-Akunnu Akoko Road when the hoodlums struck and whisked them to an unknown destination. The incident was said to have caused panic among residents of the agrarian community. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident, saying investigation had commenced into it. “Our men are already in the area to rescue the victims,” the PPRO stated. The traditional ruler of Ikaramu, Oba Andrew Momodu, confirmed that the workers were abducted as they closed for the day’s job. According to him, the hoodlums struck after the expatriate contractor handling the project left with the policemen guarding him. The monarch appealed for more security men to comb the forest to rescue the victims. Similarly, the Alauga of Auga Akoko, Oba Samuel Agunloye, appealed to the government to consider the Isowopo area as it needed serious police and military presence as it shares boundaries with Edo and Kogi states. “The incessant kidnapping and other criminal acts are now worrisome in the area,” he stated. It was gathered that the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Okeagbe Akoko, Mr Ade Akinwande, led his men to comb the forest to arrest the hoodlums and secure the release of the victims.
