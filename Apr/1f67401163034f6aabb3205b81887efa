The Presidency on Friday attributed the recent call by Father Ejike Mbaka of Adoration Ministry, Enugu on the President, Major General Buhari (retd.), to resign to the President’s decision to reject a contract request made by the cleric. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said this in a statement titled ‘Father Mbaka is everything apart from what he claims to be.’ The statement read, “An outsider distilling the avalanche of verbiage, will be surprised that after supporting the President two times to win the Presidency, Father Mbaka has made a complete U-Turn, preposterously asking President Buhari to resign or be impeached. “Here is the point of departure: Father Mbaka asked for a meeting and to the shock of Presidential Aides, he came accompanied by three contractors. The President graciously allowed them in, and to everyone’s surprise, Father Mbaka asked for contracts as compensation for his support. “Anyone familiar with President Buhari knows that he doesn’t break the laid down rules in dealing with contracts or any other government business for that matter. He requested the appropriate authorities to deal with the matter in accordance with laid down rules. “Inside the Villa, discretion prevailed, that if those pictures and requests were made public, the followers will turn against the religious leader. None of it was released. Now, this is what is eating Father Mbaka.” Recall that Mbaka recently claimed that God asked him to withdraw his support and prophesy for the President. He asked that the President resign honourably or be removed over the rising insecurity in the country.
