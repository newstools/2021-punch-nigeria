Commissioner, Cross River State Sports Commission, Gladys Igut, has hailed Governor Ben Ayade on his contributions towards sports development in the state. Team Cross River finished 12th at the recent National Sports Festival in Benin City, amassing a total of 30 medals comprising of nine gold, six silver, and 15 bronze, despite attending the multi-sports event with just 35 athletes. Speaking on The PUNCH’s online programme, Stars Talk Football, on Thursday, the ex-beauty queen thanked Ayade for his unwavering support towards sports, saying it was evident in the team’s performance at the festival. “I really want to thank the governor, he has been really supportive since we went to the festival, he is happy with the performance of the athletes. He has the youths and sports at heart,” Igut said. “We as a commission are happy with the position we finished at the NSF, we never expected it because of the lean resources that were approved to us due to challenges. As it stands, we went there (NSF) with the least number of athletes, but surprisingly, we are 12th on the final log,” Igut said. “We went to Benin with just 35 athletes, if we had gone with the initially proposed number, which was 160, we could have done way better,” she added.
