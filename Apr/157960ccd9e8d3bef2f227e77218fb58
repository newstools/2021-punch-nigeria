A former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has told The PUNCH why the US may have given the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, a visa in the past despite his extremist views. Pantami, who has been under fire for his past extremist views and sermons wherein he glorified terrorist Osama Bin Laden, and others, had revealed during an interview last week that he had never been denied entry into the US and the United Kingdom.

In an email chat with The PUNCH on Thursday, Campbell who served as ambassador to Nigeria between 2004 and 2007, said the US usually pays more attention to actions than words because the US respects free speech. Responding to a question, he said, “As for Dr. Pantami’s sermons and other public statements, a consular officer would want to know when he made them–years ago or yesterday. There is also the question of whether he advocated violence and whether his apology is a repudiation of what he said. “Is he now part of an international terrorist network?  Or, are some of his views merely parallel to those of, say, Osama Bin Laden? As you know, freedom of speech and of thought is integral to the American system. So, actions (including inflammatory rhetoric) weigh more heavily than the mere expression of ideas or beliefs. Each visa decision is made on a case-by-case basis.” The former envoy, who authored the book, ‘Nigeria: Dancing on the Brink’, said it is rare for the US to comment on visas of individuals because of its policy on privacy. He, therefore, stated that it would be difficult to say for sure if Pantami’s visa had been revoked or why he was or will be issued with a visa.
