An Ibadan-based hotelier, Mr Oyedokun Oyeniyi; his wife, Busayo; and seven other members of the family, who were recently abducted by kidnappers, have been released. It was gathered that the nine captives were released on Tuesday. The victims were kidnapped from a hotel in Ajaawa, near Ogbomoso, Oyo State, as the family prepared for a relative’s burial last Saturday. Their abductors had demanded the sum of N32m as ransom. It was gathered that the victims were released shortly after an undisclosed amount of money was paid to the kidnappers. When contacted for confirmation, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Adewale Osifeso, simply said, “Yes, they (victims) have been released, please.”    ,, Copyright PUNCH.
