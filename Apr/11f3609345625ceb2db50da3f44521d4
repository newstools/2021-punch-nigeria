As a proactive measure, the Kano State Government, late Monday evening, directed the immediate closure of Bagauda Technical College over disturbing security reports. According to a statement issued by the PRO of the Ministry, Aliyu Yusuf, the state Commissioner of Education, Malam Muhammad Sanusi Sa’id Kiru, attributed the closure to disturbing security reports, as well as the need to protect the lives of the students and teachers. Already, no less than 34 boarding schools located on the outskirts of the metropolis have been closed due to the prevailing security situation around neighbouring states. To this end, the statement urged parents to immediately evacuate their children from the college premises and wait for further directives. ‘’The Commissioner further used the opportunity to express the state government’s appreciation to parents/guardians for their unflinching support and cooperation on government’s policies and directives, especially on security-related matters,’’ said the statement.
