Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has expressed optimism that Nigeria will overcome its insecurity challenges. The former president said there would be light at the end of the tunnel. Obasanjo was joined by Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, and his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, as he declared that Nigeria would surmount its numerous challenges. They spoke separately on Wednesday at the 108th Nigeria Baptist Convention held at the Baptist International Conference Centre, Lufuwape Town, along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The event which was equally used to conduct valedictory and commendation service for the retiring President of Baptist Convention, Nigeria, and the President, Christians Association of Nigeria, Dr. (Reverend) Samson Ayokunle, was attended by other dignitaries including Senator Ishaku Abbo (Adamawa North) among other dignitaries. In his address, Obasanjo said he remains an “incurable optimist” about a better Nigeria despite the escalating security challenges. He said “When I was coming here, I didn’t intend to make a speech. And you will see that unlike my two brothers (referring to Governors Abiodun and Makinde) I don’t have anything to read. “If you have brothers like this, do you have anything to fear? So, I told them to make a speech and I have come to concur. So, I concur. “But having concurred, if I don’t say more than that, you will leave here and say ‘Obasanjo is I concur.’ “Is that good enough? My two brothers talked about the situation we are in (insecurity). You know, I’m an incurable optimist about a number of things, but particularly about Nigeria. “Epon Agbo wa n fi ni, koni ja (the situation may be threatening, we won’t be consumed.) There will be light at the end of the tunnel.” Obasanjo, who is a member of the Baptist Church, commended Ayokunle for serving meritoriously in his capacity as a leader in the Baptist Church.
