THE Federal Road Safety Corps in Anambra State has arrested a suspected human trafficker and rescued five girls. The FRSC Sector Commander in Anambra State, Ayodele Kumapayi, said the suspect, a driver, who identified himself as Frank Lucky, 36, was apprehended on the Onitsha-Awka Expressway. Kumapayi said the suspect was arrested by FRSC patrol team on Tuesday when they stopped a black Nissan Primera vehicle with Registration Number BEN 468 HP, for bordering on offence of seat belt violation. The commander said, “Our patrol team had earlier set out to book the driver for seat belt violation, but on close inspection, they noticed five girls inside the vehicle, which raised their suspicions. “The vehicle was impounded and taken to the command. When the driver was interviewed, he claimed he was taking the girls to work as house helps and farmers on their family farmland in Benin, Edo State. “The victims, who said they were from Vande Ikya in Benue, told us that they were going to Benin to sell pepper soup and beer in a beer parlor. “The situation was reported to our headquarters and we were directed to alert the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons in the state for further investigations.” The NAPTIP Commander in the state, Judith Chukwu, while receiving the suspect and the victims, said they would commence investigations on the matter.
