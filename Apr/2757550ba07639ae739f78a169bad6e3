Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, says he might become a pastor after serving as a governor for eight years. The governor whose first tenure will expire in 2023 said this at the 108th Nigeria Baptist Convention held at the Baptist International Conference Centre, Lufuwape Town, along Lagos-Ibadan highway on Wednesday. While noting that he loves reading, studying, and sharing the Bible, Abiodun said, “I may end up on the pulpit after I have served as governor for eight years.” He also preached that Nigerians should follow the instructions of God in their daily activities to help Nigeria grow. “All we need is the fear of God in conducting our affairs. We all need to treat our fellow human beings with love and even take care of our environment with care. If we do, we will live a more peaceful and prosperous life. “More importantly, we must reject violence and pursue peace with one another. We need to walk in love and understanding. This is what our heavenly Father expects from us. “We, therefore, look forward to the continued reign of peace in our land and the constant strengthening of the body of Christ,” he added. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, and Senator Ishaku Abbo (Adamawa North), among other dignitaries, also attended the event. On his part, Obasanjo expressed optimism that Nigeria will survive various challenges confronting it at present.
