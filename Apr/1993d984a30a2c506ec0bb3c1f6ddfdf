A former president of Ijaw Youths Council, Worldwide, Udengs Eradiri, has called on youths from Ijaw extraction to shelve their planned protest to compel the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to inaugurate a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission. Eradiri, who is the Special Assistant on Youth Matters to the Interim Administrator of NDDC, Effiong Akwa, pleaded with the youths to drop the planned protest in view of the security situation in the country. The ex-IYC president in a statement on Tuesday argued that such planned protest could worsen the security challenges the country was currently facing. He added that such a protest could be hijacked by hoodlums, whose aim might be to attack innocent citizens. Maintaining that the IYC should not allow itself to be seen as creating opportunities for hoodlums to shed blood of innocent Nigerians, Eradiri urged the youths to support the ongoing efforts of the President, the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, and Akwa to conclude the ongoing forensic audit in the commission. He pointed out that the forensic audit was designed to clean the rot in the NDDC and give the interventionist agency a new beginning. Eradiri said in the statement, “The audit is recording tremendous progress. The auditors are now on field assignments after which they will write and submit their reports.” Copyright PUNCH.
