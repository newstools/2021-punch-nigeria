The National Security Adviser to the President, Maj.-Gen Babagana Monguno (retd.), has assured airport users and stakeholders of the safety of aviation infrastructure in the country. Critical government infrastructure have come under attack in the last couple of months due to the worsening security situation in the country. In a statement on Thursday, the NSA Office assured airport users that there was no cause of alarm for any security breach at the nation’s over 20 airports. The statement read, “The attention of the Office of the National Security Adviser has been drawn to reports of a threat of the nation’s airports from an internal government correspondence. “The correspondence was a routine threat assessment to ensure preparedness of agencies and not meant for public dissemination. “In the period covered by the correspondence, threat analysis identified the need to advise airports management nationwide to upgrade existing security measures around the nation’s airports. “Regrettably, the unauthorised releases of this advisory is likely to raise fear among airport users home and abroad. “Accordingly, this statement is issued to reassure the public and all aviation stakeholders of the safety of our airports. “Security and intelligence agencies in the country will continue to monitor security threats and provide the assessment and timely advice required by airport managements to continuously upgrade security measures in the airports.”
