The governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, has threatened to dethrone traditional rulers who do nothing while crime increases in their domains. The governor stated this at a security stakeholders’ meeting in Owerri on Thursday, which had in attendance the newly deployed Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 9, Ekim Okon. The governor, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Prof. Placid Njoku, said traditional rulers must take responsibilities for the things that happened in their communities. The governor also called on the leadership of Christian Association of Nigeria, the Nigeria Labour Congress, the Students Union Government and market unions to join his administration in securing the state. He said, “Insecurity is one thing Uzodinma takes seriously. There is no alternative to security. We must ensure that Imo State is secured. To interact among ourselves and assign responsibilities to ourselves is the main focus of this meeting. “What must a traditional ruler do in securing his community? A traditional ruler must have a system to check insecurity. If every traditional ruler does their job well, insecurity will abate. “The Imo State Government has resolved to depose any traditional ruler who fails to do something while insecurity increases in his domain.” In his contribution, the AIG asked the traditional rulers to partner the police in securing society. Apparently referring to Eastern Security Network linked to the Indigenous People of Biafra, Etim said it was wrong to torch security formations and kill security operatives in the name of agitation.
