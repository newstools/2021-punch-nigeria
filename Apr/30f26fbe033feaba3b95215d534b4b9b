Chemical and Allied Products Plc says it posted a profit after tax of N203m for the first quarter of 2021, with a PAT margin of 9.7 per cent. The paints and coatings company said it generated revenue of N2.1bn in Q1 2021, lower than that of Q1 2020 by 9.5 per cent. It reported a profit before tax of N299m, with a PBT margin of 14.3 per cent. The company said operating expenses were better managed with opex/sales of 23.3 per cent, an improvement of 252 basis points from 25.8 per cent in Q1 2020. According to its unaudited financial statements, its inventory rose by 11 per cent to N2bn at the end of March 31, 2021 from N967m in December 2020. Its cash stood at N5.7bn, of which N1.4bn is expected to be distributed as dividends to shareholders in June 2021, according to CAP. The Managing Director, David Wright, said, “In the first quarter of 2021, we saw the biggest impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Increased global demand for chemicals driven by the economic rebound in Asia and feedstock challenges, with several suppliers declaring force majeures, resulted in a global shortage of raw materials. “This significantly impacted product availability in the first quarter of the year. In addition, there was a scarcity premium placed on all available raw materials which eroded gross margin across various product lines.” He said the company had taken steps to secure alternative raw material sources and was increasing inventory levels to mitigate against further disruptions.
