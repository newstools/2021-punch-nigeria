The Senator representing Ebonyi Central, Obinna Ogba, on Wednesday said no amount of instigated crises in the South East could deprive the zone the presidency. Ogba made the declaration while briefing journalists on a motion he sponsored on incessant killings in Ebonyi State. He alleged that the killings in most parts of the South Eastern states were politically motivated and would not stop the zone’s agitation for the presidency in 2023. He said, “Though there were pockets of crises in some of the states before now, but the rising wave of such crises resulting in wanton killings of innocent lives and destruction of property is political. “Why is it that it is when agitation for South East to have a taste of the Presidency in 2023 is gaining momentum that the senseless killings got intensified?” The Senator had earlier in the motion on incessant killings in Ebonyi State, expressed concern over the  degenerating state of security in the country. According to him, one of such instances was the mayhem unleashed on people in Obeagu, Egedegede and Nkalaha communities in Ishielu Local Government  Area of Ebonyi State by suspected herdsmen on March 30, 2021. He said there was an urgent need for intervention by the Federal Government. The Senate, in adopting the motion’s prayers, urged the Nigeria Police Force and other relevant security agencies to carry out comprehensive investigation of the attacks and killings. It also urged the Federal Government to put appropriate measures in place to forestall further attacks just as it mandated the National Emergency Management Agency to provide enough relief to all victims of the attacks and crises.
