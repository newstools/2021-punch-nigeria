Nigeria’s former Minister for Finance and the current Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, will be the guest speaker at the forthcoming Nigerian Institute of Management’s 60th anniversary celebration. According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the Registrar/Chief Executive of the Institute, Tony Fadaka, the Diamond Jubilee will have two major events, the anniversary lecture and luncheon. He said the 60th anniversary lecture themed ‘Celebrating 60 years of management excellence: Poised for more’, would be delivered by Okonjo-Iweala on July 14, 2021. Fadaka added that the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Channels Television, Dr John Momoh, would be one of the discussants. The registrar said the institute had been in the forefront of entrenching management excellence through painstaking best management practices in the country in the past 60 years. The NIM boss said, “Management excellence is an aspirational state of being always slightly beyond the current state of management practice providing fuel for learning, adaptation, and growth.” The registrar stressed that the choice of Okonjo-Iweala as guest speaker was in consonance with what the institute stood for and in recognition of the guest speaker’s wealth of experience and achievements both nationally and globally.
