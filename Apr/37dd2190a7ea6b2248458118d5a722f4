The senator representing Lagos East Senatorial District, Adetokunbo Abiru, has won the suit initiated by the Peoples’ Democratic Party which was sought to disqualify him. A three-man panel of the Court of Appeal sitting in Lagos on Thursday affirmed the March 1, 2021 decision of the Justice Chukwuka Obiozor, of the Federal High Court in Lagos which dismissed Babatunde Gbadamosi and the PDP’s suit for lacking in merit. Recall that Abiru won the December 5 2020, senatorial bye-election by a landslide, polling 89,204 votes against Gbadamosi’s 11,257 votes. But Gbadamosi and the PDP challenged Abiru’s eligibility to contest the election. But in dismissing their case, Justice Obiozor agreed with Abiru’s counsel Kemi Pinheiro, SAN, and APC’s counsel Abiodun Owonikoko, SAN, that the issue of residency and indigeneship were not factors for disqualification under the constitution. Dissatisfied, Gbadamosi and PDP approached the appellate court. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN led other lawyers for Gbadamosi and the PDP. The court in its judgment agreed with Pinheiro’s arguments and held that the appeal was unmeritorious. The court also dismissed the arguments of the appellants that the 2nd Respondent had irreconcilable names. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
