No fewer than 1500 pupils of both public and private primary and secondary schools in Ondo State have benefitted from a donation from the Bola Ilori Foundation. The foundation donated school uniforms, bags and some other learning materials to the beneficiaries. At the distribution of the items to the beneficiaries at Ondo town, the chairman of the foundation, Mr Bola Ilori, said the gesture was borne out of his desire to contribute his quota to the advancement of education within the Ondo community where he hailed from. Ilori who is also the Chairman of the Federal Government Task Force on Monitoring and Enforcement of Nigerian Expatriate Business Permit and Expatriate Quota Administration, however, noted that the gesture had nothing to do with politics . He said , “Our children must be given all the confidence that they are not subordinates to any other children in the world regardless of skin colour, and technological exposure. Every child and every Community is unique and a lot can be achieved by looking inward using the power of education and knowledge. “It is in view of this facts that I have decided to contribute the educational advancement of Ondo Kingdom as a community development effort. A total of 1500 students will be benefiting from the Bola Ilori Foundation school uniforms, bags, and some other school kits.” Ilori added that the future of the younger generations would be truncated if the larger part of the society were not educated.
