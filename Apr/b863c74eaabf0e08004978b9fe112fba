Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele, has been honoured with a doctorate degree by the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Emefiele was honoured at the 23rd-25th joint convocation of the varsity held on Friday. At the event, he also delivered a lecture with the theme, ‘Jumpstarting the Agricultural Revolution: The CBN experience’. The CBN governor implored the graduands to take advantage of the facilities offered by the CBN such as the Anchor Borrowers Programme, amongst other lending programmes, for activities that would result in progressive gains for them and the country at large. He tasked varsities, research institutes to promote research that would enhance yields per hectare by farmers and reduce other constraints faced by farmers. Emefiele said, “CBN can provide a commercial outlook to research breakthroughs on improved seeds by ensuring a guaranteed market through off-take of seeds for adoption by our farmers. “The seed industry is a multi-billion dollars investment, and this offers a low hanging fruit in a potential collaborative effort between the CBN and the University Community.”
