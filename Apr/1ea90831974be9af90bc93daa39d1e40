THE Ado Ekiti Local Government Area chapter of the All Progressives Congress, in Ekiti State, has commenced the process of suspending the caretaker chairman of Ado Ward 8, Mr. Clement Afolabi, over alleged affiliation with a pro-Ahmed Tinubu campaign group, the South West Agenda. The Special Adviser to the President, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, hails from the ward. Afolabi, was invited to face a disciplinary panel via a letter signed by the local government caretaker secretary of APC, Mr Temitope Oluwasola. The letter was titled, ‘Your Political Anti-Party Activities and the need to Defend Yourself,’ dated April 27th, 2021, it was addressed to the ward chairman. The letter of invitation read in part, “Your anti-party activities have come to our notice and attention by your ward. These include blackmail against the party and the state government, failure to attend meetings of the party, division of ward EXCO members into factions, as well as your confessional statement as a coordinator/chairman of an unauthorised group in Ado local government.” In response, Afolabi, while denying the allegations, said, “All the allegations against me in the letter are not true. I am a committed party man since inception and I will not do anything that will affect the chances of the APC in Ekiti State and the country at large. I will respond appropriately to the party through my lawyer”. When contacted, council chairman, Akinleye, told journalists there was nothing unusual about the invitation. Copyright PUNCH.
