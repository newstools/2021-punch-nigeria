The Director-General of the International Labour Organisation, Guy Ryder, has called on all workers and employers of labour to strengthen occupational safety and health systems during and post COVID-19 pandemic. He made the call in a video message to mark the World Day for Safety and Health at work. Ryder said, “The impact of COVID-19 on the safety and health of workers has been profound. For some workers such as those in health and social care, the nature of their jobs puts them at greater risk. “For all workers, the threat posed by COVID-19 extends beyond catching the virus itself. We have seen increase in work related stress, violence and harassment. “There has been a rise in mental health and psychosocial issues and delay in treatments for other serious health conditions.” Copyright PUNCH.
