The Cross River State security outfit, Operation Akpakwu, has arrested a clan head, his wife and son for alleged kidnapping in the Akpabuyo Local Government Area and subsequently demolished their houses. The clan head of Ikot Atambi was identified on Monday as Etinyin Akamba Eyo, aka 30:30,  whose two houses were demolished by the security outfit. It was further gathered that his shrine where kidnappers and militants allegedly got fortified was also destroyed. Operation Akpakwu operatives said Eyo allegedly made some useful confessions. Also demolished was a building at Plot 24c, Satelite Town, where a kidnapped victim was released a few months ago. The Permanent Secretary, Special Services, Governor’s Office, Alfred Mboto, said, “I know there was an operation there (in Akpabuyo). There was a demolition of suspected kidnappers and criminals’ hideout.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
