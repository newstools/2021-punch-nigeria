THE Governing Council of the Ladoke Akinola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, has announced the appointment of Prof. Mojeed Liasu, as the acting Vice-Chancellor of the institution in replacement of his embattled successor, Prof. Michael Ologunde. Ologunde was directed to step aside in a letter by the Oyo State Government through the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Olasunkanmi Olaleye. The step-aside directive by the state government had been greeted with reactions from the Academic Staff Union of University and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, LAUTECH chapters. However, the Governing Council of the institution, in a letter signed by the varsity’s Registrar, Dr K.A. Ogunleye, issued after its 138th inaugural meeting held on Wednesday at the Council Chamber, announced the appointment of an acting VC for the university with immediate effect. The statement titled, ‘Notice to all staff,’ signed by the Registrar of the university, Dr. Kayode Ogunleye, read in part, “Council, having noted the directive, and in order not to create vacuum in the system, approved the appointment of the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Prof. M. O. Liasu, as acting Vice-Chancellor with effect from Friday, April 16, 2021 until further notice.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
