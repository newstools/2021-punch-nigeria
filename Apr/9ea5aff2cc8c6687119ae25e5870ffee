Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Friday kicked off a one-month training for the newly recruited 1,056 community police constables in the state, urging the people in the state to provide timely information for the police in preventing crime. AbdulRazaq said the initiative was long overdue and commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for keying into community policing which he said would strengthen internal security architecture. The governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, said the success of the project depended on full support by the people, noting that the police are a reflection of society they serve. He said, “The people are integral to the success of the police. The people will give the information that the police will act on. These constables are products of the society and they will operate within the society that they understand. This is the essence of community policing.” AbdulRazaq commended the police in the state for ensuring the safety of lives and property, maintaining that the exemption of Kwara from states with high security risks by the United States travel advisory testified to the police diligence. On his part, the Kwara State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Bagega, said the initiative was intended to enhance success in the fight against crime.
