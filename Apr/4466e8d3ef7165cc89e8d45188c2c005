An aide to a former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, on Tuesday said no court in Nigeria had ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to recover “even a pin” from him. The aide, Sam Onwuemeod in a statement in Owerri, was reacting to a document making the rounds that an unnamed court had ordered the EFCC to withdraw 33 “stolen” properties and funds belonging to the state government from him. The statement reads partly, “No court in the land, both within and outside, whether magistrate court, or  customary court , or  state high court, or  federal high court, or  appeal court or Supreme Court,  had  ordered EFCC to recover even a pin from Okorocha. “The same EFCC they had talked about was the same commission that invited Okorocha on Tuesday, April 13, 2021, and allowed him to go  on Thursday, April 15, 2021. “Those behind the gimmicks could not reason to the extent of knowing  that if the court at any level ordered EFCC to recover all that they had  listed from Okorocha, the commission would not have invited him for questioning. “And now that we have expressly denied or stated that, no court in the land,  at any level,  had ordered or asked the EFCC to recover the items from Okorocha, the burden or onus has now fallen on them, to show evidence or proof of their claims.” Copyright PUNCH.
