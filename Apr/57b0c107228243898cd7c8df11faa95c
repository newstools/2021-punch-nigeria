The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has expressed its displeasure with the reduction of cost of nomination forms for candidates into the chairmanship, vice chairmanship and councillors in the forthcoming council elections. In a statement signed by the state PDP Chairman, Adedeji Doherty, the party noted that council elections should be a contest among youths. It appealed to the Lagos State Electoral Commission to consider waving nomination fees for women and youths interested in contesting for positions in the forthcoming council elections. The statement read, “Furthermore, considering the current economic hardship, effects of COVID-19 and most importantly, youth unemployment, nomination forms into any position in the forthcoming council elections for persons below the age of 45 years should be free. “Our position in the Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party is that forms should be free for women and persons below the age of 45 years as a way of encouragement,” the statement read.
