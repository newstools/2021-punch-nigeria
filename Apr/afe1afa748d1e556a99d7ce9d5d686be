SOME gunmen had reportedly abducted three passengers in a commercial bus in Osu town, along Osu/Ife road, in Osun State. The victims, whose identities could not be immediately ascertained, were said to have been abducted around 7:40pm on Saturday by some men wielding dangerous weapons. Sources in Osu also said the victims were dragged into the bush by their abductors, who shot indiscriminately into the air after their vehicle had been stopped. When contacted, spokesperson for Osun Police Command, Yemisi Opalola, said the abduction of one person was reported to the police. Opalola further explained that one Rebecca Okunade reported to Osun Division of the Nigeria Police Force that she got a call that her husband was abducted.
