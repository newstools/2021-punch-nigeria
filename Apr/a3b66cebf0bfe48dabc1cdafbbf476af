FORMER President Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has showered encomiums on the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, for the infrastructural development of the state. Obasanjo spoke in Sokoto on Saturday, while performing the foundation laying ceremony of a flyover project awarded by the state government. He described the ongoing capital projects by the Sokoto State government as “not only for the economic development of the state but also for the entire country.” In his remarks, Governor Tambuwal said, “This flyover at Runjin Sambo is one of the numerous legacy projects that will have lasting impact on the life of our people and cause the facilitation of the development drive of our state. “Other projects on the drawing board include the 342 housing estate, the provision of infrastructure for the Sokoto New City projects and construction of the Southern Bypass. “The government is also into partnership with interested developers in the housing sector for the provision of shelter to more of our citizens.” Copyright PUNCH.
