Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said claims by his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki that Federal the Government printed about N60 Billion to share to the federating units in March cannot be regarded as spurious. The governor challenged the Central Bank of Nigeria to unequivocally declare if money was printed or not. Wike stated this while briefing journalists in Abuja on Sunday, according to a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, and made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt on Sunday. “Obaseki was in APC, so he understands them. So, Obaseki couldn’t have come from the blues to say they printed N60 billion. He knows them,” he stated. The Governor further said it was regrettable that instead of the Governor of Central Bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to address the issue raised by Governor Obaseki, he opted to issue a veiled threat to states to pay back bailout loan given to them by the federal government. He said, “Instead of answering the question, he (Emefiele) said governors have to pay back the bailout loan. The bailout is a loan, if you want to take it, go and take it. But answer the question whether money was printed or not printed.”
