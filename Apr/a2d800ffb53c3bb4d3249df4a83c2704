Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, on Tuesday, signed the Abia State Water Bill into law to facilitate the state government efforts in providing affordable potable water to all households in the state. Speaking during the ceremony at the Government House, Umuahia, Ikpeazu described water as a very critical element that played an important role in improving the socioeconomic status of citizens. The governor said that the law would provide a legal framework that would guide the actions and mandate the state government to provide affordable potable water for households in Abia. He said that the law enunciates the responsibilities and duties expected of citizens to make the provision and accessibility of portable water to be a success in the state. Ikpeazu said that in order to give impetus to the Law, the state government had launched the Abia State Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Policy. He said that the policy had seven components that were evolved based on the background, geography, and hydrology of Abia State. According to him, it is expected that this policy would aid the government in deploying efficient strategies that would improve access to potable water, as well as boost sanitation and hygiene awareness in the state. Ikpeazu said that clearly defined issues on finance, research, development, monitoring and evaluation were encapsulated in the Abia WASH policy. “Officially, I declare a state of emergency in WASH sector. This is another requirement that will catalyse the achievement of our dreams and goals. “People are no longer allowed to defecate in public places. The public is advised to caution and guide their actions. “We are going to give impetus to the Ministry of Environment and Abia State Water and Sewage Corporation to enforce government’s desires,” Ikpeazu added.
