Ogunjimi said, “Over and above our determination to build value for all of our stakeholders, such as ensuring that our consumers have one less thing to think about when it comes to their children’s education, we are currently aware of their difficulties, especially as a result of the pandemic, and we want to help alleviate them. The statement said that the firm, through its retail unit, SKIT, leading educational and office retail supply and Marcel Hughes, Nigeria’s foremost School Uniform brand, launched a campaign to reward its customers with over N6m worth of discount, vouchers and gift items for back-to-school supplies including bags, school uniforms and shoes, stationeries and more.
