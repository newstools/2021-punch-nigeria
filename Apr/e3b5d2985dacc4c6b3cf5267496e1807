The Lagos State Government has presented 10 brand new buses to public servants in different arms of government to ease transport challenges encountered by workers in commuting to and from their homes to their offices. The state Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, noted that the presentation of the buses was a follow-up to the 35 buses allocated to the centralised staff bus scheme. Muri-Okunola, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Office of the Head of Service, Samson Ajibade, said, “The new buses handed over to the public servants will ease their transport problems, guarantee early resumption to work and improve productivity, and I want to urge the staff to reciprocate the kind gesture of Mr Governor because to whom much is given much is expected.” Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, the Permanent Secretary /Tutor General District 1, Titilayo Solarin, expressed optimism that the challenges encountered by the workers while commuting to and from work would be reduced.
