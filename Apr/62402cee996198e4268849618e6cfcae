The Bauchi State government has suspended an Islamic cleric, Malam Abubakar Idris, for inciting preaching. A statement by the Commissioner for Religious Affairs and Social Welfare, Ahmad Jalam, on Thursday said the suspension was indefinite. According to the statement titled, ‘Violation of the ethics of Preaching and Sermons in the state,’ the cleric was accused of  castigating companions of Prophet Muhammad in his preaching. This, the government said, was capable of instigating violence which could lead to the breakdown of law and order in the state. The statement read in parts, “The report revealed that you are castigating the companions of our noble Prophet Muhammad (SAW) while conducting your preaching. “This attitude is a clear violation of the conduct and ethics of preaching that is capable of raising people’s tension and certainly lead to the violation of law and order which the government may not tolerate. “Consequently, you are suspended from conducting preaching and leading congregational prayers in any part of the state in the interest of peace.” Efforts to get Idris on Thirsday failed as he could not be reached on the telephone. Meanwhile, reacting to the suspension, the Chief Imam, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Dr Mansur Yelwa, said clerics who preach against mainstream Islam should be dealt with to avert jungle justice for blasphemy.
