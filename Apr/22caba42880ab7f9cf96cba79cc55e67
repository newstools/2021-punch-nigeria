The Vice-Chancellor, Precious Cornerstone University, Ibadan, Prof. Kola Oloke, has said the consumption of animal skin can increase the risk of contracting cancer. Oloke, while presenting a seminar, titled, ‘Lifestyle, Diseases and Management,’ at the PCU campus, Ibadan on Tuesday, said cancer was preventable and curable. The microbiologist warned against the consumption of animal skin popularly called ponmo, attributing the consumption of animal protein as the major cause of cancer which, according to him, has led to the death of many. He said, “Consumption of animal protein can lead to diseases in the body. More importantly, it causes cancer. Run away from meat, especially red meat. If you want to eat chicken, eat the local one. Animal skin known as ponmo is harmful to the body; it has no nutritional value.” He said 60 per cent of the chronic diseases worrying the people could be prevented through a healthy diet, adding that “other lifestyle measures must include managing stress, avoiding toxins (like alcohol and tobacco), regular exercise as well as ensuring adequate sleep.” Oloke, who said cancer and other chronic diseases could be cured through nutrition, said lifestyle could determine the gravity and nature of sicknesses that humans could be nursing in the body. “One of the things that cancer cells thrive on is sugar. So, if you can take off the consumption of sugar from any cancer patient, you would have helped the patient. Some foods and fruits are high in sugar content such as banana, apple and pineapple. Also, cancer patients should avoid animal-based milk but can be consuming plant-based milk,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
