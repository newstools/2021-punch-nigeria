Residents of Kanamma, the headquarters of Yunusari Local Government Area of Yobe State, were made to flee their town with many sleeping overnight in the bushes as Boko Haram laid siege. It was gathered that the group attacked the town in ten gun trucks at about 6.30pm on Thursday making the residents flee into bushes and neighbouring villages for safety. The number of casualties and the level of destruction from the attack could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report as the mobile network was epileptic. Confirming the attack to journalists on Thursday night, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Yobe State Police Command, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, said the insurgents attacked Kanamma but the details were not available. He said on phone, “Yes, there was a Boko Haram Insurgents attack on Kanamma. Unfortunately, we have lost contact with our people there due to the absence of mobile network in the area. We will update you when we reach out to them.” A community leader in the area who spoke anonymously to journalists lamented that the people of the town have had to run into the bush for safety. Meanwhile, all military and security outfits in both Borno and Yobe states have been placed on red alert as Boko Haram/ISWAP group have been seen to have gathered in large number across the two states.
