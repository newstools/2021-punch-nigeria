A coalition of widows and next of kin to late primary school teachers in Akwa Ibom State on Monday took to the streets to protest alleged government’s failure to keep to its promise on the payment of gratuities and pension to it members for a long time now. The group alleged that government in a bid to stop the proposed protest had gone on air to announce the commencement of payment on Monday, adding that government was not sincere about the payment. The retired teachers who stormed Government House as early as 8am displayed placards of various inscriptions. Some of the inscriptions read, ‘We don’t want radio payment again’, ‘Govt is not sincere about payment of our gratuities and pension’, among others. Speaking with newsmen shortly after the protest, Secretary of the Coalition, Mr Benjamin Benson, explained that they came out to protest because government’s information about payment was an impromptu one. “Today, we wanted to sleep here at the gate of the Government House until they pay. But we want to give government the benefits of the doubt,” he said The Chief of Staff to the Governor, Mr. Ephraim Inyangeyen, who addressed the protesters, pleaded with them and promised that payment could only be guaranteed on Wednesday.
