NINE gunmen, who allegedly attacked a former governor of the Central Bank, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, at his hometown in Isuofia, Aguata Local Government Area of the state, have been arrested. Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, disclosed this on Wednesday at a function at the Prof. Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre, Awka. The hoodlums killed three police orderlies attached to Soludo on the occasion. The state Commissioner for Public Utilities, Emeka Ezenwanne, was also abducted on the occasion and released some days after. Revealing the arrest of the suspects, Obiano said, “The nine persons are now in our net. What happened last month was unfortunate, but let me tell you, we have restrategised and we are coming out like a smoking gun. “We are not going to take prisoners. The nine people that attacked Prof. Soludo are in our net now. We are going to eliminate them. We will go after the others. “We are not going to take prisoners any longer. A special squad has already been put together, and they are already working everywhere.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
