All Progressives Congress Chieftain, Bola Tinubu, has been honoured with a doctorate degree by the Federal University of Agriculture in Makurdi, the Benue State capital. Tinubu, in an acceptance speech at the 23rd to 25th convocation ceremonies of university on Saturday, appreciated the university Senate and Governing Council for the honour. He said, “My deep thanks to the esteemed Federal University of Agriculture for awarding me this honorary Doctorate. A special thanks goes to the University Senate and Council. This is indeed a tremendous honour.” The former Lagos State governor also urged the graduating students to be change agents in the agricultural sector so as to end the food crisis confronting the nation. He said, “Many of you will become extension agents and farmers. You have the professional and moral obligation to call forth new practices that make our farms more productive, and our harvests more abundant so that our hunger and hardship become more infrequent. “These things will not come easily but they will come by dint of intelligent labour and patriotic commitment. There are things the farmer must do differently: you must have the conviction to persuade him to change for his own good. “You must also have the courage and wisdom to identify those things government must do differently to bring the desired changes.” “May all of you find great purpose in your life’s work. Some of you will work in agriculture. Some in other fields such as engineering and science. A few may venture into the scariest vocation of them all – politics. Some will become famous. Yet, it is not everyone’s fate to be well known. However, let it be the fate of everyone graduating here today that you be known to always do well,” he concluded.
