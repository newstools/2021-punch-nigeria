THE Oyo State Police Command said its men had begun a manhunt for a gang of bandits that reportedly shot dead one of the Amotekun corps in the state. The bandits had attacked the Amotekun corps at a farm in Fiditi in the Afijio Local Government Area of the state on Tuesday and one of the corps, Suleiman Quadir, 25 years old, was  killed during the attack while another, Amo Yisau, was injured. It was gathered on Wednesday that the Amotekun operatives were escorting some workers of a farm when the hoodlums, who had laid ambush for them, shot Suleiman dead while Amo was shot and injured. The bandits, numbering about 11 reportedly swooped on the Amotekun corps and the farm workers. Amo was fortunate as he survived the attack, but he was said to be receiving treatment at the General Hospital, Owode. The Commandant of Amotekun in Oyo State, Col. Bisiriyu Olayanju, said in a statement on Wednesday that the slain Amotekun officer had been buried according to Islamic rites. Describing him as a gallant man, who was committed to his job, he said he left aged parents, wife and a son behind. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Adewale Osifeso, who also confirmed the incident, told our correspondent on the telephone that the police had begun an investigation into the attack. He said, “A large scale investigation is in progress and our detectives are actively on the trail of the suspects.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
