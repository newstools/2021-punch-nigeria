Nigerian fintech company Flutterwave has been listed as a pioneer on TIME’s newly released list of 100 Most Influential Companies making an extra ordinary impact around the world. Flutterwave joined global leaders such as Apple, Pfizer and Biontech, Nike, Mastercard, Stripe, Netflix, Zoom, Microsoft and Facebook on the list. It is the only African company listed in this year’s line-up. In March, Flutterwave hit tech-unicorn status after it raised $170m in Series C funding from global investors, valuing the company at more than $1bn. In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic enforced lockdowns across Africa shut out shops from their customers, Flutterwave was able to quickly set up a digital storefront for over 20,000 store owners, ensuring business owners could continue to serve the needs of the populace.
