Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, says he never doubted the qualities of in-form striker, Kelechi Iheanacho, when he joined the club. The Nigerian has repaid Rodgers’ trust in him by scoring 14 goals in his last 14 appearances for the club in all competitions, taking up the scoring mantle after Jamie Vardy’s shyness in front of goal in recent games. Iheanacho’s explosive performance has seen him fire Leicester into their first FA Cup final in 52 years and also anchoring them into next season’s Champions League, with a late winner in their 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Monday. “I remember coming here and he wasn’t playing so much, there were doubts about whether he could play to the level, but I think that was because he hadn’t played regularly. But he was always confident. When he did play with Jamie, he showed they could play together,” Rodgers said at the club’s pre-match press conference. “It was never about ability, it was about his resilience to keep going until he got that chance. We all love him here, he comes in with a smile. You see how courageous he is. He does a lot of finishing exercises. He wants to get better and the coaches are great with him. “The two (Iheanacho and Vardy) together, their strengths complement each other. Both can threaten in behind. They have a synchronised way of playing. Jamie hasn’t scored the goals but his movement has created space and that’s helped Kels. My only worry with him is that he is running out of celebrations. Hopefully he can keep scoring and keep celebrating.” The Nigerian will be hoping to continue his goal scoring form when the Foxes clash with Southampton on Friday. Copyright PUNCH.
