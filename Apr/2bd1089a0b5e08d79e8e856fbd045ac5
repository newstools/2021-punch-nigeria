The owner of Pelly Foam Industries Limited, Ibadan, Oyo State, Dapo Davies, and the traders in the complex have appealed to the Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, to grant them approval to rebuild the destroyed complex. The foam-making industry situated at Dugbe, Ibadan was gutted by fire last year. This was contained in a letter by their counsel, S.O. Sanni & CO, to the governor. The letter, dated April 8, was made available to our correspondent on Wednesday. The traders explained that though they had submitted necessary documents requested by the relevant agencies for renovation permit, the approval had not been granted. They appealed to Makinde to prevail on relevant agencies to approve the renovation permit with a view to allowing them to carry out necessary renovation of the building. The letter partly reads, “Your Excellency in your usual magnanimity gave out palliatives to settle the traders affected by the fire incident which our client appreciated and still appreciating. “Our client was directed to produce a renovation permit for approval by the relevant government agencies which was promptly done and submitted to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey and the Town Planning Department, a building plan which is most unnecessary. “Submission of the building plan was based on the advice of the Town Planning Department. “We however regret to note that the government department responsible for approval of building plans has refused to approve the renovation permit for almost one year after the fire incident.” Copyright PUNCH.
