THE Bayelsa State Governor, Mr. Douye Diri, has inaugurated a 31-member committee to review payroll irregularities especially as it affects teachers and Local Government Council workers. Diri, mandated the committee to also review the salary grades of health personnel among other categories of workers. He said the discovery of irregularities during the last staff promotion exercise conducted in the various councils, led to the discission  to set up the panel. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, expressed hope that the exercise would free up funds to enable the government implement the N30,000 minimum wage for council workers. This was contained in a statement by the deputy governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mr Doubara Atasi, on Tuesday. Diri, was quoted as saying, “As you are all aware, the promotions have been implemented. But there are complaints of underpayments, overpayments and over promotions. So, this review is to address those complaints. “We want peace and industrial harmony within the local government system, but we do not want the system to be short-changed. As a government that is people-centered and staff welfare-oriented, we look for ways to ensure that the local government system functions effectively. “The state government will support the local government councils with an additional N252m, bringing the total amount of money the state government gives as support to councils to about N400m monthly.” The committee, which is expected to submit its report within one month of inauguration, is headed by the governor’s Technical Adviser on Accounts and Treasury, Mr Timipre  Seipulou.
