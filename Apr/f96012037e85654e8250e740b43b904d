Two students of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, who were kidnapped last Saturday, have been released. The Director, Information, Protocol and Public Relations of the university, Mrs Rosemary Waku, said in a terse statement on Wednesday that the students were returned to the campus on Tuesday. She identified the victims as Israel Farren Kwaghgee and Solomon Salihu. She, however, did not say if ransom was paid before the students were set free. An official of the university had told our correspondent that the kidnappers contacted one of the parents of the victims and demanded N20m. Also confirming the development, the state police command spokesperson, DSP Catherine Anene, said the students had been released. Anene had on Monday disclosed that three students were abducted, but she failed to give the number of those released by their abductors when contacted on Wednesday. “The kidnapped students of the University of Agriculture have been released unhurt.  Investigation into the case continues please,” Anene said in a statement.
