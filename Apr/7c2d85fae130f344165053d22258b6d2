The Peoples Democratic Party has condemned the caution issued by the National Broadcasting Commission to Channels Television. NBC issued the caution after Channels Television interviewed the spokesman of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Emma Powerful, on its Politics Today programme. The Commission said the IPOB spokesman was allowed to make inciting declarations on air without reprimand by Channels Television. It said the programme was clearly in “violation of the provisions of the Code, and extant provisions of the Broadcasting Act.” Reacting, the PDP said the disposition of the NBC “could be counter-productive and heighten the already tensed situation in our nation at this critical time.” The party said this in a statement titled, ‘NBC Fine Against Channels Is Draconian,’ and ​signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. The statement read, “The PDP describes the reported suspension and fine of N5m slammed by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) on @channelstv over alleged violation of broadcasting code, as draconian. “The PDP stresses that, without prejudice to the issues raised against @ChannelsTv, the reported hasty clamp down, without the benefit of caution, is suggestive of intolerance and high-handedness by the regulatory body. “Our party is worried that such disposition could be counter-productive and heighten the already tensed situation in our nation at this critical time. “The PDP, therefore, urges the NBC to review the punitive measure on the media house as well as scale-up system-friendly measure that will ensure best practices in information dissemination in our country.”
