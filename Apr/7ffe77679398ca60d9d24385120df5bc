A former Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to call a meeting with all stakeholders in Nigeria to discuss the growing spate of insecurity in the country. Kalu, while featuring on the current affairs programme on Channels Television, Sunday Politics, said the meeting should include current and former public office holders, as well as traditional and religious leaders. The senator, however, stated that it would not be another national conference. He said, “The National Assembly is there. We have done a lot of national conferences. We need to discuss. Any discussion we have done, they will take it to the National Assembly to move it forward.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
