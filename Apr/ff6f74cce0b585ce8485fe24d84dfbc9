Everton ended their 25-year wait for a win at Arsenal and moved to within three points of the Premier League’s top four after Bernd Leno’s own goal secured a 1-0 victory amid supporter protest at the Emirates Stadium on Friday Night Football. Richarlison’s cross flashed through the Arsenal goalkeeper’s legs with 14 minutes remaining as a tumultuous week at Arsenal – which began with the club’s intention to join a European Super League – ended in a home defeat. The hosts thought they had been awarded a second-half penalty when Dani Ceballos was fouled by Richarlison, but Nicolas Pepe was deemed offside in the build-up upon VAR review. Everton remain in eighth position but move to within a point of sixth-placed Tottenham and are now six points clear of Arsenal in ninth.
