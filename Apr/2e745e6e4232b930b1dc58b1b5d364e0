Nigerian defender William Troost-Ekong has helped Watford stage an immediate return back to the Premier League, following a 1-0 victory over Millwall at the Vicarage Road Stadium on Saturday. Troost-Ekong made 32 appearances for The Hornets, putting in solid performances as the club returned to the topflight football just after a season in the Championship. Watford gained promotion to the Premier League with two games still to play. “It’s been a team effort. Everyone is ready to give everything to the team and it’s a really good time to be at Watford right now,” Troost-Ekong wrote on his Twitter handle ahead of the game. Ismaila Sarr’s composed 11th-minute penalty, after the Senegal winger was brought down in the box by Billy Mitchell, proved enough for the Hornets. Mitchell drew a save from home keeper Daniel Bachmann before the break with a shot from outside the box before Mason Bennett saw his follow-up effort clip the top of the bar. Bachmann clawed away a close-range effort from a corner as Millwall pressed for an equaliser in the second half, but Watford held on to secure an eighth successive league victory at Vicarage Road. Watford have followed Norwich City in securing an instant return to the flight after relegation last season, and their impressive home form has been the cornerstone of their promotion bid. Troost-Ekong arrived at Vicarage Road last summer and he has been a valuable addition to the squad, starting 32 games this season. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
