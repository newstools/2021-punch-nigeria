Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State said on Friday that his administration would track state contracts and recover state funds in the hands of contractors who failed to deliver projects. The governor made the vow during an inspection tour of the newly renovated Jericho Nursing Home, Jericho, Ibadan, stating that the previous contractor handling the project did not complete the work. According to him, under no circumstances would he allow the state’s fund to be frittered away. He said his administration would ensure that the people of the state get the desired value for their money. He said, “Every kobo of Oyo State money that people have taken without delivering value to the people, they will give it back to us. “Well, for the ones that we did, yes I am satisfied. But the previous contractor, we can all see, did not finish the work. We went round to look at the transformer but it is not yet energised and it is just really unacceptable. People may think we are not going to go after them but I can give you the assurance that we will. “Basically, I am here to see the renovation work that has gone on in here and also listen to them about the challenges they are having. As you probably must have known, health is one of the major pillars of this administration. We have to keep working to ensure that the health care in Oyo State is well delivered.”
