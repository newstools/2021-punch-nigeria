The Federal University, Oye Ekiti on Tuesday sacked the embattled Registrar of the institution, Mr Olatunbosun Odusanya, following approval by the University Governing Council of the report of the Disciplinary Committee. The Council, headed by Dr Mohammed Yahuza, had on April 20th, 2021, suspended Odusanya from office to pave way for investigations into allegations of misconduct leveled against him over irregularities in appointments between 1st August 2020 and 10th February 2021. This was disclosed in a statement on Wednesday by Chief Information Officer, Foluso Ogunmodede, and the Special Adviser on Media Matters to the Vice-Chancellor, Wole Balogun, titled, ‘FUOYE Governing Council sacks Odusanya as Registrar’. “His sack was approved by the University Governing Council on Tuesday after critically looking at a report by the Council Disciplinary Committee set up to review the report of the Investigative Committee which reviewed all appointments during the said period. However, the Council has approved Mr Mufutau Ibrahim as FUOYE’s Acting Registrar,” the statement added. FUOYE VC, Prof. Abayomi Fasina, has, however, allayed the fear of witch-hunting. Fasina said, “Those entertaining such fear or being furnished with such rumour should perish the thought as my administration is not going to witch-hunt any member of staff. I have no plan to sack any staff member of our great Ivory Tower. “However, in line with the Council’s directive, we will review all the said appointments with a view to regularising all appointments that measure up to our standards, most notably departmental needs, qualifications, proper placement, and due process. “I assure you, no one will be a victim of the suspension of the Registar by the Governing Council of our great Citadel of Learning. “Rather, staff members shall continue to enjoy the best in terms of incentives to work, proper training to hone their skills and amazing welfare packages that will continue to gladden their hearts.”
