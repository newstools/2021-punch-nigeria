The Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress has said the  nationwide membership registration/revalidation will finally end on Wednesday (today) after three extensions. The National Secretary of the APC CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, made this known to our correspondent in Abuja on Tuesday. The first phase of the exercise was earlier scheduled to end on February 23. It was scheduled to end on March 31, 2021. On April 1, the committee extended it by three weeks. Akpanudoedehe had on Thursday, while inaugurating the Membership Registration Appeal Committee of the APC on behalf of the Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, noted that the exercise would determine the success of the ruling party’s congresses and national convention. Speaking to our correspondent on Tuesday, the Secretary of APC CECPC said the exercise would not be extended. According to him, the committee expects a report on it within two weeks, following which the appeal committee would begin its work. When asked if there would be an extension of the exercise, Akpanudoedehe said, “No. In fact, I just wrote now to the Secretary of the Registration Committee headed by the Governor of Niger State (Abubakar Sani Bello) that they should send their report. That letter has gone out. We are collecting the report and if there is any complaints, we are going to send it to the appeal committee. The appeal committee is also receiving complaints. “The only way we can do without extension is if there is any way we can register members where they have been side lined.” The Secretary of APC CECPC said the Bello-led committee is to present its report within two weeks.
