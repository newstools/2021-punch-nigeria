The registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Is’haq Oloyede, has said the board has some rogues centres across the country. Oloyede on Wednesday while monitoring the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations registration in Lagos said the rogue centres were created so as to apprehend and disqualify cheating candidates. He said, “We have seen parents pay someone to write exams. We disqualify the candidate when they are caught. “To catch a rogue you may need to pretend that you are one too. We also opened rogue centres where we asked them to pay N15,000 if they want their marks to be upgraded. Once you submit your number we will collect your N15000 and disqualify you.” He also condemned the unscrupulous acts of some schools who were charging above N4,700 for the purchase and registration fee of UTME. Oloyede cautioned prospective candidates not to pay more than N4,700 for the purchase and registration of UTME, adding that any CBT centre which charged more than N700 would be discredited. “JAMB is collecting N3,500 but most of these schools charge more. All these elites schools, that is what they do. We have informed the ministry. I will write again to the Federal Ministry of Education to sanction these schools. “The president has already reduced the cost of UTME to N3500, N500 for a book and N700 for registration at CBT centres. “We will discredit any CBT centre that collects more than N700.00,” he said.
