HOODLUMS, in the wee hours of Tuesday, attacked the Federal High Court, Abakaliki, the Ebonyi state capital, burning some sections of the building. Two security guards were also injured during the attack that was said to have occurred around 1am in the night. The hoodlums, who reportedly scaled the court’s perimeter fence to carry out the attacks, it was gathered, used petrol bomb to perpetrate the act. The court’s library and the security post were badly torched. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Garba Aliyu, confirmed the incident, saying the suspected arsonists set the court ablaze through the use of some improvised explosive devices. Aliyu said, “But it’s important to point out that the entire court building was not burnt. It was some part of the court building that was destroyed. They used some improvised explosive devices to unleash the attack. They threw it inside. “But because of the very quick intervention of men of the Nigerian Police Force and the Fire Service, the fires was put off immediately. But we are investigating and will definitely bring the perpetrators of this distardedly acts to face the law.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
