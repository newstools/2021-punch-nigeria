The African Telecommunications Union and Ericsson have published a series of recommendations to enable governments and regulators across Africa to accelerate Information and Communications Technology and next-generation connectivity. The recommendations are the first findings of a Memorandum of Understanding between ATU and Ericsson focused on enhancing spectrum development across the continent, according to a statement on Friday. The launched spectrum recommendations outline the importance of awarding the radio spectrum in countries across Africa in a timely, predictable and cost-effective fashion so as to support affordable, high-quality delivery of ICT services and spur smart technology initiatives. The recommendations also establish the idea that licensing should be technology-neutral and allow for service innovations. The new spectrum recommendations further encouraged African countries to enable spectrum sharing by giving licensees the right to share their spectrum voluntarily through various means such as trading and national roaming agreements.
