Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has said the state will support the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons to rehabilitate victims and prosecute traffickers. Sanwo-Olu, while receiving the NAPTIP’s Director-General, Imaan Suleiman-Ibrahim, at the Lagos House, Alausa, on Monday said the unabated trafficking in persons was a threat to the country. The governor, according to a statement said the state would support the agency in human capital requirements and operation space to boost the agency’s response to the crime. “Human trafficking indeed presents a deadly trend in our society and we need to protect our citizens, especially the vulnerable in our communities. For those who have fallen victims, we must stand up and protect them. “The support and collaboration which the NAPTIP has enjoyed from Lagos State Government could be strengthened. Through the Ministry of Woman Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, we have rendered support to NAPTIP in terms of human and material requirements for your zonal office,” he said. Suleiman-Ibrahim, while responding said Lagos remained strategic to the fight against human traffickers, because of its proximity to international borders, which she said made the state prone to trafficking activities.
