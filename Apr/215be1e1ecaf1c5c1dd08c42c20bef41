The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo (SAN), has reminded the Peoples Democratic Party of how Channels Television was treated during the administration of late former President, Umar Yar’Adua. This was after the PDP faulted the caution issued by the National Broadcasting Commission to Channels TV for interviewing the spokesman of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Emma Powerful. The PDP had said the disposition of the NBC “could be counter-productive and heighten the already tensed situation in our nation at this critical time.” Reacting to the statement from the PDP, Keyamo warned the main opposition party against an “attempt to deceive Nigerians.” “I am NOT airing my personal opinion on NBC’s action here, but let me remind PDP how its govt treated Channels TV when it merely (and correctly too) reported the ill-health of President Yar’Adua. See it here and don’t EVER attempt to deceive Nigerians,” the Minister tweeted with a link to a report by Voice of America. The report showed that Channels TV was shut down for broadcasting a story that Yar’Adua, a PDP President, would resign for health reasons. “The government is really serious about this report. It has shut down one of the main private TV/radio stations in Nigeria. It is called Channels TV. And not only that, the government also descended on the station with plainclothes security people, who chased out all the staff and sealed up the station. Information Minister John Odey was very, very angry at the station, saying the station reported the supposed resignation of President Umaru Yar’Adua without confirming the story,” a VOA correspondent said.
