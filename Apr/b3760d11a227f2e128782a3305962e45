Olayomi Koiki, a media aide to Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has alerted the public that gunmen attacked the residence of the activist in the early hours of Monday. There were reported sporadic shootings around Soka, the Ibadan residence of Igboho, as some heavily-armed gunmen stormed the area. In a viral video shared on Facebook, Koiki claimed that Igboho’s residence was besieged by soldiers with the aim of arresting the activist. It would be recalled that security agents had in February allegedly attempted to arrest Igboho along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Today in a viral video, Koiki said, “There is a situation right now where the Federal Government of Nigeria tried to invade our residence. We are telling the world that the war that the Federal Government is looking for might start today. “We cannot be caught unawares. You cannot threaten us. Chief Sunday Igboho is fine.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Oyo State Command, Adewale Osifeso, could not be reached as of the time of filing this report.
