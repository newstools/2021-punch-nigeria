A former general evangelist of the Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide, Prophet Kayode Abiara, and his wife, Grace, will organise a special vigil and prayer session for men and women on Friday (today) and Saturday. Abiara, in a statement, said the event would hold at the CAC, Agbala Itura, in the Ile Epo area of Lagos State. The cleric said he was being led by the spirit of God to organise a special vigil which would start by 11pm for men while his wife will lead the morning prayer session for women immediately after the vigil. Abiara who said the theme of the event was, ‘Obedience to the word of God,’ added that her wife would be supported by Prophetess Esther Ajayi. “Everyone is invited to these programmes, as God would touch all diverse of problems and resolve them in the lives of people, men and women,” he said.
