Some bandits on Sunday night invaded Kofar Kuyambana low-cost housing estate in Zaria, Kaduna State, and kidnapped two housewives. But the police, vigilante, and other security operatives acted swiftly to distressed call, stormed the area, battled the bandits, and arrested five of them. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the incident. A source told our correspondent, on Monday, that the incident took place about 9:30 pm, noting that some Islamic school pupils were hit by bullets and taken to an undisclosed hospital in Zaria for medical attention. The bandits were said to have invaded the estate in large numbers on motorcycles, shooting indiscriminately. “They succeeded in taking away the Custom Officer’s wife, leaving the children who were shouting, behind,” said the source, adding that “the bandits attacked another house where another wife was taken away too.” “The police were able to arrest two of them (bandits) on Sunday while the other three (bandits) were arrested this morning (Monday),” he added.
