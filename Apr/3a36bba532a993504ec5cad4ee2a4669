The Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority said on Wednesday that it had saved over $350m from the previous payments on subsidy and import substitution through the implementation of the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative. The NSIA said in a statement on Wednesday that following notable successes and transformative impact of the initiative over the past four years, the Presidency had approved its restructuring, starting in the 2021 cycle with various modifications. Under the modifications, the NSIA has been transitioned to an upstream player, thereby limiting its involvement to importation, storage and the wholesale of raw materials to blenders, according to the statement. The NSIA said its subsidiary, NAIC-NPK Limited, would be spun off to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated. It said under the new arrangement, blenders would no longer be paid blending fees by NAIC-NPK as they would recover their costs directly from selling fertiliser to the market. It said this would balance the incentives of the business and ensure blenders build the right capacity to actively participate in the local supply sub-sector. The statement said, “The blending plants are expected to provide bank guarantees to cover requisitioned raw materials demand that are appropriated for their respective production volumes. “As part of the new structure and in line with the Presidential directive, the Federal Ministry of Finance Budget and National Planning and the Central Bank of Nigeria are expected to engage commercial banks to facilitate lines of concessionary credits to blending plants for the purchase of raw materials.
