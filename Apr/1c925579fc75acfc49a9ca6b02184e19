The House of Representatives has urged the Federal Government to name the Akure airport after a former governor of Ondo State, the late Olusegun Agagu. The call was made in a motion jointly sponsored by members of the House from Ondo, which the House adopted at the plenary on Thursday. Agagu was Ondo governor between May 2003 and February 2009 when a court nullified his re-election for a second term. He died on September 13, 2013. The motion titled, ‘Need to Name Akure Airport After Olusegun Agagu,’ was sponsored by Messrs Mayowa Akinfolarinwa, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, Adejoro Adeogun, Oluwatimehin Adelegbe, Peter Makinde, Gboluga Ikengboju, Tajudeen Adefisoye, Omolafe Adedayo, and Kolade Akinjo. The sponsors recalled that the Akure airport was built by the Federal Government in 1986 as a domestic airport and was meant to serve Ondo and other neighbouring states like Ekiti and Osun. The motion reads, “The House is desirous of the need for the Federal Government to give due recognition to Dr Olusegun Agagu who had served in various capacities and demonstrated quality leadership to encourage others to dedicate their lives to service to the nation.” Adopting the motion, the House urged the Federal Government to “recognise the selfless services of Dr Olusegun Agagu to the nation, most especially in the aviation industry and name Akure airport after him.” The House also urged the Federal Government to “provide financial support to the Ondo State Government for optimum maintenance of the airport.” Copyright PUNCH.
