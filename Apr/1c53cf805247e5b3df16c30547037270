The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has commissioned the upgrading and relocation of the New Massey Children Hospital from its previous location on Lagos Island. Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday laid the foundation for the reconstruction of the hospital in a new site in Adeniji Adele. Sanwo-Olu said the construction of the hospital reflected his administration’s determination to close access gap in the health sector. He said, “The construction of the New Massey Children Hospital reflects our unwavering determination to bridge all gaps in the health sector while the reconstruction of three major roads on Lagos Island demonstrates this administration’s commitment to an inclusive developmental agenda for Lagos State. “As a result of increasing number of patients, who daily throng the hospital to access quality medical services, the capacity has been overstretched and the hospital must be urgently upgraded to meet the patients’ needs.” The Commissioner for Health Prof. Akin Abayomi, described the hospital as the first major project in the health blueprint strategy of the Sanwo-Olu administration. He explained that the 150-bed, multi-disciplinary paediatric hospital would sit on a 4,000 square metres of land, and would be built to take care of staff welfare. “It will provide secondary integrated care services, and acute care to both inpatients and outpatients in line with international best practices. It will also help to engender significant reduction in infant and maternal mortality.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
