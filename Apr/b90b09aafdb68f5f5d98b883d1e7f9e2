In a bid to ensure food security in the state, the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has inaugurated the sale of fertilisers and other agricultural inputs for farmers in the rainy season. The governor, who spoke at the launch in the Andaha, Akwanga Local Government Area of the state, explained that the endeavour epitomised the readiness of the state government to foster partnerships and collaboration towards giving agriculture its pride of place. “Today, we are flagging off a total of 1,020 metric tons of fertiliser, which is 20,400 bags. We also have 1,950 sprayers, five tons of improved seeds and assorted agro-chemicals. “I wish to charge the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and the Local Government Distribution Committee to ensure that the relevant smallholder farmers benefit from this gesture of government,” Sule said. He warned against any attempt to hijack the sale of the fertilisers and other farming inputs, stressing that violators would be met with stiff punitive measures, irrespective of their status in the society.
