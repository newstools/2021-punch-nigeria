First Republic Minister of Aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, has advised members of the Eastern Security Network to defend themselves if attacked. ESN is controlled by the Indigenous People of Biafra which has been proscribed by the Federal Government. The security outfit recently lost a commander, Ikonso, during an operation involving the police, army and operatives of the Department of State Services. This is as the South-East region has been troubled by attacks on police formations and operatives including a prison in Imo State. In a statement reported by DailyPost, Amaechi expressed the belief that IPOB has nothing to do with the attacks in the region. “I will advise IPOB to steer clear of what is happening in the South East and let the truth be revealed. Let them maintain the sanctity of their innocence. If the ESN people are attacked, let them defend themselves. I don’t want IPOB to go into violence because they have neither the arms nor the wherewithal and capability to do that. “Who is investigating these attacks? The Police are investigating the IPOB. Can the police investigate the government or themselves? What is happening now is like what Hitler did against the Jews, sent their secret service men to commit certain crimes and got back to accuse the Jews. “I believe they are sending them to commit these attacks and burning of properties so that the impression will be that IPOB is behind it in order for them to either kill them or declare a state of emergency in Igbo land or to do whatever they like or completely kill the Igbo the way they like,” he said.
