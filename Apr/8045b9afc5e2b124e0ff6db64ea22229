A faction of the Peoples Democratic Party has suspended the former Kano State Governor, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, over the crisis, that erupted at the North-West Zonal Congress in Kaduna last week. Kwankwaso’s suspension was contained in a query letter signed by its Secretary H. A. Tsanyawa, to the former Kano Central Senator by a faction of the party. The PDP in Kano is factionalised with Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, leading a faction, while a former Foreign Affairs Minister, Aminu Wali, is championing the other group. However, the North-West Zonal Congress of the PDP in Kaduna State last Saturday ended in a disaster, as thugs were said to have taken over the venue, destroying ballot boxes, as well as tearing the ballot papers. The letter, dated April 16, 2021, said Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has been suspended on three counts of “leading his supporters into a shameful and embarrassing act of thuggery of disrupting the democratic process during the PDP Northwest Zonal Convention of April, 10th, 2021. “That you are also charged with abusing our two serving governors and major Northwest stakeholders present during the convention. “That your supporters have destroyed the election materials, on your directives, and in your presence.” It said the Executive Council meeting held on Thursday, April 15, 2021, unanimously resolved to suspend Kwankwaso and his supporters for three months, in accordance, with the provisions of Section 58(1) of the PDP constitution. Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso is requested to reply to the query within 48 hours and state why the provisions of Section 59(1) (2) (3) and (4) would not be applied against him. Efforts to reach Kwankwaso proved abortive as of the time of filing this report.
