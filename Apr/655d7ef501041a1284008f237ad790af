The Nigeria Senate, on Friday, gave the assurance that efforts had been intensified to reform the land transport system in the country. It expressed sadness that while the Federal Government and states spent billions of naira on building airports and seaports, the land transportation system had continued to be cheated by the lack of land ports but only motor parks. The Vice-Chairman, Senate Committee on Land Transport, Nicholas Tofowomo, said this during the launch of the Travellers Accident Insurance Scheme by the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria in Abuja. “We in the Senate must put our hands together to reform our land transport system,” he said. Speaking, the RTEAN National President, Alhaji Musa Tankobi, said the organisation was mindful of reforming the transportation industry in the country. “We are calling on the Federal Government to prioritise the establishment of the Bank of Transportation, and prioritise the budget for federal roads for private investors to come in,” he said.
