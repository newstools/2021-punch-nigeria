The Ondo State Government on Wednesday insisted that a former deputy governor of the state, Mr Agboola Ajayi, must returning the remaining two vehicles out of the initial four that was in his possession. Ajayi, who insisted that there were only two vehicles in his possession, had expressed his readiness to return the two vehicles for peace to reign. But the state government said there were four vehicles with him and he should return the remaining two. The Senior Special Assistant to the State Governor on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr Doyin Odebowale, said this in a statement made available to journalists. Odebowale asked the former deputy governor to return the two vehicles or be ready to face the consequence. According to the statement, the four vehicles belonging to the government with Mr Ajayi are a Toyota Land Cruiser SUV (new), two Hilux vans (new) and Toyota Hilux (fairly used). Odebowale said, “It is laughable to read from Mr Ajayi that he has chosen to return two vehicles as an act of magnanimity. “Returning properties converted is not an act of sacrifice or statesmanship. The alternative will be to confront a gruelling criminal trial for stealing.” While saying that the former deputy governor should not have left office with government’s vehicles, he added “Mr Ajayi should do the needful or be ready for the consequences.” Copyright PUNCH.
