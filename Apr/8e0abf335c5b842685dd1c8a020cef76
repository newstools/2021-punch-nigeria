The wedding photos of a couple has set the internet agog as the groom was forced to show up a pair of shorts and a bandage on his hand after being involved in an accident where he fell off his motorcycle and injured himself four days prior to the wedding. The weddings might be about a union of two souls, but the occasion has also become more elaborate when it comes to dressing up for the big day. Even if you prefer something a little more minimalistic, you definitely wouldn’t imagine yourself attending the most important day of your life with just a pair of shorts.  But the nightmare came true for one man in Indonesia, Times of India reported. Photos of a young couple from the East Java region of Indonesia went viral on Twitter, showcasing the groom shirtless and clad in nothing but a pair of shorts. He also had an arm sling on with a couple of bandages plastered on his knees. However, the bride was up for the occasion and looked lovely in traditional Javanese wedding attire. The tweet which was posted on a microblogging site by a user named browski, went viral with many people being left baffled with what they had seen. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
