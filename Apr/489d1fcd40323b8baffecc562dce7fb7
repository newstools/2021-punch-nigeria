The Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso, has cautioned its students over the violence act and destruction of properties in the hospital. The students’ violence act was in reaction to the death of a 500-level student of the school, Bernard Afeson. Recall that last week, the students went rampage when Afeson was pronounced dead at the hospital after he fell into a septic tank. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Omotayo Ogunleye, said, “There was never a time complaints were presented or forwarded directly or indirectly to the hospital management either by the students’ body or the university management that it never received attention. Physical attacks and threats on medical doctors and other health workers must henceforth stop. It is important to note that the damage done to equipment, ambulances and other vehicles in the hospital will run into millions of naira.” Ogunleye explained that Afeson was said to have climbed an electric pole, adding that in the process, he fell down into a septic tank. It read, “The deceased was brought into the Accident and Emergency Unit of the hospital on Thursday, April 22, 2021 at around 5pm. He was said to have been brought already dead as documented by the attending physician. “However, the students were said to have returned to destroy the properties of the hospital and chased the hospital workers with the intention of harming them. “In the midst of the rampage, the chairman, Medical Advisory Committee, Dr Olugbemiga Abodunrin, was held hostage. Some workers were said to have been wounded, some locked themselves up in toilet to avoid being harmed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
