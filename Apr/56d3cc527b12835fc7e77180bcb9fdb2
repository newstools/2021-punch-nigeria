On the outlook for this year, he had said, “We expect the marginal reopening of businesses, normalisation of the economy and revenue-diversification drive of the Nigerian government to elicit positive sentiments throughout the year. “Our growth expectations should be noted with caution, as the recent second wave of COVID-19 in Nigeria and globally may slow down renewed social and economic activities.” Copyright PUNCH.
