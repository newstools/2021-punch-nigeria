In a bid to resolve the crises generated by the emergence of Prince Tsola Emiko as the Olu of Warri-designate, the two factions on Wednesday held a peace meeting with Assistant Inspector General in charge of Police Zone 5 in Benin, Edo State. The two factions led by the traditional Prime minister of Warri Kingdom, Chief Ayiri Emami and the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, Chief Johnson Atseleghe, who represented the palace, met for over four hours. When representatives of both factions emerged from the meeting, they refused to grant interviews.  However, a source said both parties had resolved to embrace peace. He said, “The peace meeting went well and both parties expressed their desire to embrace peace. They all know that without peace nothing can be achieved. So the crisis will soon end.” The demise of the immediate past Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli (Atuwatse II), in December 2020, had created a succession tussle which eventually produced Prince Tsola Emiko. The police had last week questioned Chief Ayiri Emani over the invasion of the palace of the Olu of Warri, after which it was alleged that the 400-year-old crown and the symbol of the Itsekiri monarchy was missing.
