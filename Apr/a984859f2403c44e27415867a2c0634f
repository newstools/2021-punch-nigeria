Chief Operating Officer of the Nigeria National League, Emmanuel Adesanya, is hopeful Vandrezzer FC would consider making a return to the league after announcing their withdrawal from the league last week. The Lagos-based club, in a statement, announced their decision to quit the league, citing unfair treatment by the NNL as one of the reasons they opted to pull out. However, in a chat with The PUNCH, Adesanya said efforts were made to have the club reconsider their position and return to the league. He said, “NNL has not said anything about the Vandrezzer issue because in the first place a club has the right to join an association and also the right to pull out. Nobody is happy to see them pull out but if a club wishes to and they have a convincing reason, there is nothing we can do about it. “But on two or three occasions they were invited and we are making efforts to see them make a return to the league.” Copyright PUNCH.
