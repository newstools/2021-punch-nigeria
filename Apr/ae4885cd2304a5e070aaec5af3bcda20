Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, says asking for United States assistance to tackle the menace of kidnappings and killings does not mean the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rted.), lacks capacity to crush the bandits and terrorists in the country. He, however, said the country needed foreign support in terms of superior equipment and technology. Sule, who is a member of the President’s party, –the All Progressives Congress – stated this on Friday while featuring on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ programme monitored by The PUNCH. From Maiduguri in North-East Nigeria to Mbaise in the South-East; and from Kafanchan in the North-West to Kajola in the South-West, the killings and kidnappings soar, almost unprecedented. Many Nigerians including senators and governors have in the last few days urged the President to seek foreign help to put a stop to the ceaseless bloodshed and kidnappings nationwide. The former military head of state finally caved in to pressure on Tuesday when he asked the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, for the support of the Joe Biden administration to tackle the security menace in Nigeria. Buhari, who warned of a likely spill over of insecurity to neighbouring West African states, also called on the US to consider relocating US Africa Command from Stuttgart, Germany, to Africa, nearer the Theatre of Operation. Speaking on Friday, the Nasarawa State governor said, “A lot of people keep saying that we need outside support. Having outside support doesn’t necessarily mean that we don’t have the capacity. Most of the wars that have been fought in the world, a lot of countries ask for foreign support. “Even if you bring somebody from outside, he has to understand your environment. Our (security) personnel understand our environment and they are doing the best they can do.”
