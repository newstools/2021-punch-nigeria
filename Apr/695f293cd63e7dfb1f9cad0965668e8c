Jorge Masvidal says it hurts to be knocked out by Nigeria’s Kamaru Usman for the first time in his career and in front of family, friends in Florida. He said this after losing in their rematch at UFC 261 at Vystar Veteran’s Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday. Usman floored Masvidal (35-14, 12-8 UFC) with a picture-perfect straight right hand and sealed the deal with approximately five hammerfists on the canvas in the second round. Reacting, Masvidal also said Usman won fair and square and was the better man. He said, “I thought we were gonna wrestle more. I was ready to wrestle 25 minutes,” “All the props to him in the world, he caught me by surprise. He’s got my number, nothing I can say but he won this fair and square and God bless him, man. “In the presence of my family, friends and fans, It hurts (to lose). I’ve never been knocked out in 50 pro fights. Usman showed me something he didn’t show me in the first fight. I didn’t feel his power and that’s what happens when you’re overconfident. “All the props to him in the world. He caught me by surprise. He’s got my number. Nothing I can say, he won this fair and square. God bless him.” At UFC 251 last year, Usman beat Masvidal via unanimous decision in a fairly one-sided bout. But Masvidal came into that fight on just six days’ notice after Usman’s initially scheduled opponent, Gilbert Burns, tested positive for the coronavirus. Masvidal is one of the biggest stars on the UFC roster. The Miami native was on a three-fight winning streak before falling to Usman last year and again this year. In 2019, Masvidal knocked out Darren Till, Ben Askren and Nate Diaz in a span of eight months to become one of the hottest MMA athletes in the world. The latter was for the mythical BMF title at Madison Square Garden. Masvidal, 36, has been a pro fighter for almost 18 years but has just recently become one of the most popular MMA athletes in the world.
