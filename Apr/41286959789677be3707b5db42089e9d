Chairman of the Nigerian Union of Teachers, Adamawa State chapter, Rodney Nathan, has faulted the verification conducted by the state government which declared over 2,000 teachers working with the Post Primary Schools Management Board ghost workers. Nathan, who disagreed with the outcome of exercise, said his deputy, who was part of the team that conducted the screening, was not paid his salary for March. Recall that salaries of over 2,000 teachers were stopped in March because the state government labelled the workers, who failed to turn up for payroll audit, verification and screening, ghost workers. Nathan dismissed the government’s claim, saying the union rejected the report because the conclusion reached was made in haste. He said, “We cannot ascribe credibility to the government biometric screening carried out by a consultant. Because in the payroll, which has over 12,000 personnel under the state post-primary schools management board, non-teaching staff has not been differentiated from teaching staff and the number of non-teaching staff, exempted from the screening is higher than the 2,000 ghost workers in question.” He explained that the deputy chairman of the union, who represented the union on the screening and verification panel, did not get his salary He added, “Does that mean he is a ghost worker along with others.” Copyright PUNCH.
