Gunmen have reportedly abducted no fewer than 18 passengers from a commercial bus in the Ibarapa area of Oyo State. Our correspondent gathered that the passengers were coming into Oyo State from Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State when the bus conveying them was waylaid and forced to stop by the hoodlums. The incident was said to have happened on Thursday morning between Igboora and Eruwa Road. Although residents of the area could not ascertain the actual number of those in the bus, all the occupants were said to have been been whisked away by the gunmen. The Secretary Farmers Union in Ibarapa, Taiwo Adeagbo, told our correspondent that the incident happened on Thursday morning. He said kidnapping had become almost a daily occurrence in the area saying some residents were collaborating with outsiders to perpetrate the crime. He said, “The bus is still beside the road there between Eruwa and Igboora. I have told the police, I told our senator and others. I am saddened by these happenings.” The Convener of Igangan Development Advocates, Oladiran Oladokun, also confirmed the development. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State Command, Adewale Osifeso, could not be reached as at the time of filing this report.
