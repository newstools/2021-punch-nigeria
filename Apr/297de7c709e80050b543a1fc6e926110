THE Plateau State Police Command has confirmed an attack by gunmen on a missionary school in the Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that during the attack, which occurred at the Calvary International Ministry, close to the Yakubu Gowon Airport on Thursday morning, the gunmen abducted two students, but one of them was later rescued from the gunmen after a gun battle with security operatives. Villagers said that the gunmen had attempted to kidnap dozens of students, who were already sleeping, but some of the students noticed strange moves and quickly alerted the security agencies who responded swiftly forcing the bandits to flee. Confirming the attack in a statement on Thursday, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ubah Ogaba, said, “The Command received a report of abduction of a student pastor from King’s School, Gana Ropp, in Barkin Ladi LGA. “Tactical operatives have been deployed to the area.
