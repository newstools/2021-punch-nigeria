LESS than 24 hours after bandits launched an attack on a military camp in Zagzaga community in Munya Local Government Area of Niger State, the Nigerian Army has shut down its camp and evacuated its soldiers from the community. The Army, supported by the youths in the community, has equally begun a search for one missing soldier after the attack. On Wednesday morning, about 60 bandits invaded a military camp in the said community and engaged soldiers in a gun battle, even as some of the bandits were said to have been seriously injured. None of the soldiers was injured in the attack except the missing RSM of the camp. A source close to the community told this medium that few hours after the soldiers moved out of the community in what the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Matene, said was a “tactical withdrawal”, the bandits had launched coordinated attacks on some communities in the area. About 15 persons were said to have being abducted from these communities in the midnight attacks, leaving the areas now completely deserted as the people reportedly relocated to neighboring villages. Communities that came under attacks last night were Zagzaga, Zhani, Guni and Maraban Daudu. When contacted on the latest incident, the Secretary to the State Government told our correspondent that the military camp was closed temporarily for tactical reason, stressing that the military had being stationed in the community for the past five years due to the notorious nature of the area.
