Police operatives and their counterparts from the Nigerian Army and Department of State Services have killed one Commander Ikonta and six other militia members in Imo State. The men, who were identified as members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, were killed during an early morning raid on their hideout at Awomama village, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, on Saturday. Three policemen and one army officer sustained serious bullet injuries during the exchange of gunfire with the insurgents and are presently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital. A top security source explained that the slain militia members were responsible for the attack on the Imo State Police headquarters and the Nigerian Custodial facility on April 5, 2021. They have also carried out series of calculated, violent attacks on security personnel and formations in the South-East and South-South parts of the country. The source said, “As the security forces approached the base of the insurgents, they came under rapid fire from the group. In a bold response, the joint security forces fought back gallantly. “The forces eventually neutralized the overall commander of the insurgents in the South-East popularly known as Commander Ikonso and six other armed fighters of the insurgent group. “Commander Ikonso is known as the Vice President- designate as well as the coordinator of all the militia operations of the group. He was the mastermind and coordinator of the attack on the Imo police headquarters and several other attacks on security and military personnel and facilities.” After the fierce gun battle, the security team recovered the remains of Ikonso and his fighters, including six AK47 rifles, hundreds of ammunition of different calibre, and charms. The force spokesman, Frank Mba, failed to respond to inquiries on the operation when contacted.
