Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Sunday announced his resignation while retaining interim duties, formalising a parliamentary vote to be held June 20 in an effort to defuse a political crisis sparked by last year’s war with Azerbaijan. “I am resigning from my post as prime minister today” to hold the vote, he said in an announcement broadcast on his Facebook page, adding that he would “continue to fulfil all the duties of the prime minister”.
