ONDO State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has appealed to members of the All Progressives Congress in the state, to show commitment to the party by paying their membership dues. The governor made the appeal while receiving the report of the APC Membership Revalidation and Registration Committee, in Akure, on Tuesday. While receiving the report from the committee chairman, Mr Murphy Lawal, at his office, the governor said, “I am thrilled with the work you have done. The only regret is that you registered people and they didn’t pay. What have they got to put into it? “Now that we have been registered, we must ask those who have been registered to show commitment to the party. They will have to pay to get their party cards. “Let us get our membership involved. Let us get them committed financially. Let them be financial members so that by the time we have congresses, we only involve the financial members. “You have done your work. I thank you. You have done your best. I hope the registered members will turn out to enhance our electoral victory.” Earlier in his remarks, the Secretary of the committee, Chief Taiwo Olatunbosun, said, “We have recorded success in our work here and it is due to the commitment and the passion of the governor to the party’s growth. We have coordinated in line with the guidelines of the registration exercise. “Whatever it is that we have recorded here will point to the teeming members of the ownership of the party. Ondo has been cited as one of the best states that we have succeeded in this registration exercise.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
