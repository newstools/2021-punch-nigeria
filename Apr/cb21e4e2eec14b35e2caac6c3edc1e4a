Akerodolu had on Thursday, April 1, 2021, embarked on the vacation as the first instalment of his 2021 annual leave. The vacation ended on Friday, April 23, 2021. The Deputy Governor, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, acted as governor while Akeredolu was away. In an interview with journalists in his office, Akeredolu said, “We have been on this task for over a year without a break. I knew I needed a break so that I could be rejuvenated. I took my time to do a few things. I had a good time.” Meanwhile, the governor has described his opponent and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the October 20 governorship election, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, as a worthy compatriot. This was contained in a statement congratulating Jegede on his 60th birthday. The statement was issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Richard Olatunde. It quoted Governor Akeredolu as saying, “It is without doubt that Tayo remains an appreciable figure in our dear state. His palpable passion for the state is incurable even as he remains one worthy son, we should all be proud of in Ondo State. “Between Tayo and I, there have been two keenly contested governorship elections which to the glory of God have both come my way. In spite of this, our friendship, brotherliness and professional bonds have remained strong and largely unaffected.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
