THE Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, on Thursday said any death sentence brought to his table would be endorsed. The governor said the decision was one of the measures adopted by his government to deter crime and criminality in the state. Stating that since seven years of his reign in the state, he had not signed any death sentence, Obiano said the grace had ended because of the impunity and audacity exhibited by hoodlums in the state in recent times. Obiano said this in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C-Don Adinuba. The statement read in part, “Due process has always been followed as an article of faith in the last seven years in Anambra State in accordance with the democratic tradition. “Anambra State has remained exemplary throughout the country in not just the practice of democracy, but also upholding the dignity of the human person and due process. “It will continue to uphold this excellent record in all circumstances, including in the determination to make it remain the safest and most peaceful state in Nigeria.” Debunking a news story credited to Obiano that nine suspects arrested for attacking a former governor of the Central Bank, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, and killing his three police orderlies, would face the supreme price, Adinuba said, “The reports are not accurate. The governor said he would this time not mind signing the death warrant of each person found guilty of participating in the attack on Soludo.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
