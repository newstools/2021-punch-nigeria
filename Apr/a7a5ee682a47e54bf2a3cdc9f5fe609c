A United Kingdom-based development agency, Prosperity Fund, has expressed its readiness to offer technical assistance to Ogun State on transportation. The head of the agency, Martha Bostock, at the presentation of a report by the Committee on Transportation on Wednesday at the Governor’s Office in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said the technical assistance was aimed at putting in place an efficient and sustainable transportation system. She said, “Future Cities in Nigeria will offer technical assistant to Ogun State. It is about helping to build capacity within the state government’s department like the Ministry of Transportation and other relevant agencies about what a good transport policy should include. “I like to see the policy put in place with necessary legislative action. This policy would be used to advertise the state to attract more investments which I hope would help the state development and its continued transformation.” The state governor, Dapo Abiodun, according to a statement, said the state was working towards providing an efficient and sustainable transportation system that would help in fast-tracking the socio-economic development of the state. He said the report would be fully implemented as the legal framework was in progress. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
