Worried by the increasing spate of killings, kidnappings and banditry in the country, the President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Bishop Wale Oke, has invoked God’s judgement on those behind the crime. Oke, in a statement by his media office on Thursday, lamented that the situation of the country was dreadful. It reads partly, “All those weaponising killings, kidnappings and banditry in Nigeria, Lord, visit them today with your judgement.” Noting that security was everybody’s business, it added that the government had more to do in protecting lives and property of the populace. It stressed that unless President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration approached the security challenges of the country with utmost seriousness, the nation would continue to retrogress. He said, “So, unless our government fixes our present challenges, our economy will continue to nosedive and be in the doldrums. Peace is central to the advancement of any nation. Peace is fast becoming an alien to our national life.” In addition, Oke urged the people to be conscious of their environment, stating, “We shall continue to pray for the peace of this land but our government should do the needful to arrest the gliding situation.” Copyright PUNCH.
