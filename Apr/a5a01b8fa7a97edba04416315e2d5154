The first female National President in the over 80-year history of the Student Christian Movement of Nigeria has emerged. The group, in a statement by its National President, Mrs Eberechukwu Ubesie; and National Secretary, Rev Olumide Toluwase, noted that it concluded its 31st national biennial conference on Sunday, April 11, 2021 at the Daughters of Divine Love Conference Centre, Lugbe in Abuja. According to the SCM, the conference, which started on April 9, ended with a thanksgiving and commendation service at Our Saviour’s Anglican Church, Durumi, Area 1, Abuja. The next edition of the conference is expected to be held in 2023. The statement read, “The highest point of the conference was the emergence of a new national leadership of the movement led by an astute administrator and banker of note, Mrs Eberechukwu Ubesie. “Mrs Ubesie, who takes over from the renowned evangelist and preacher, Evang Oguazi Onyemobi, is the first female National President of the movement in its 81 years of ministry to students in Nigeria.” The SCM also expressed condemnation of the rise in kidnapping and banditry in the country, “most especially as it affects innocent and harmless students in our schools.” Participants at the conference comprising secondary and tertiary students and “senior friends” were said to have connected from around the world for talks, seminars, workshops and other major presentations. Bishop Emmah Isong of the Christian Central Chapel International, who is also a member of SCM Nigeria, was the main speaker at the event.
