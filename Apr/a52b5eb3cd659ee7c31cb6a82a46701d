The Lagos State Government on Wednesday said it has concluded the first half of phase one COVID-19 vaccination in line with the directive of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency. The state Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, in a statement said the exercise which began on March 12 was done for 20 days. Abayomi said the second phase of the exercise would commence in May, saying about 257,756 persons had been inoculated as of April 15. “The conclusion of the first phase, which took an average of 20 days, followed the Federal Government’s directive to stop vaccination once half of the consignment has been administered so that those who received the first dose will have an opportunity for the second dose. This will ensure that at least one per cent of Lagos residents receive the full complement of doses required to enable the protection of the vaccine promises. The target to achieve effective herd immunity is vaccination of at least 60 per cent of the Lagos State population. The exercise lapsed on April 13. Consequently, the government has shut down all its vaccination centers. “Lagos State inoculated 257,756 persons, as of April 15, consisting of health workers, frontline workers including security agents, ports of entry staff, Judiciary, petrol station workers, contingency workers and strategic leaders. The government went a step further to vaccinate willing pensioners, people aged 70 and above, teachers and journalists during the same period. Lagos is the only state that has inoculated more than 200,000 residents during this period,” the Commissioner said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
