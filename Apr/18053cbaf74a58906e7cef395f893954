The victim, it was further learnt, hailed from Amoji Nenwe community, in the Aninri LGA of Enugu State. The deceased’s friend, who attended the wake with him, Mr Innocent Ezeogo, told our correspondent that the assailant approached them shortly after arriving at the venue and wanted to fire a shot in their midst. He noted that they protested against the move and stood up to leave when  the gunman shot his friend dead. The victim’s wife-to-be, Mrs Juliana Nnamani, said she was still in shock over the development. She called on the police to ensure the diligent prosecution of the culprit. A brother of the deceased, Mr Emeka Chukwu emphasised that the incident was a pointer to the number of illegal arms in circulation in the country. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident. Odah explained that the culprit had been arrested and that investigations revealed that he was not a vigilante. She added that the source of the locally-made gun could not be ascertained. She said, “Plans have been concluded to arraign the suspect.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
