The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra on Thursday rejected the United Kingdom’s offer of asylum for its members. It described the offer as an arrangement with the President, Major General Muhamadu Buhari (retd.), and the Federal Government to divert the attention of the people of Biafra.

The statement read in part, “The government of Britain is the sole architecture of the political, economic and religious problems of the people of Biafra in Nigeria even till today. “It has not shown any remorse or apologise to the people of Biafra. “Britain killed, maimed mesmerised and wounded our fathers, mothers and brethren through the Hausa Fulanis. MASSOB rejects their asylum gift. “How can the chief persecutor of the people of Biafra suddenly turn to be our pacesetter? Britain and Nigeria can no longer deceive the world again concerning the plights of the people of Biafra. “Our unified resilience, resolutions and unshakable spirit of no surrender will continue to hunt down this geographical expression called Nigeria. “MASSOB demands referendum on Biafra not asylum.” Copyright PUNCH.
