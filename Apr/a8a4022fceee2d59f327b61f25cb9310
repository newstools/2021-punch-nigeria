Uriah Hall has defeated a former UFC middleweight champion, Chris Weidman, without a single kick in a middleweight bout in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday. Hall recorded the crucial victory at UFC 261 in an estimated 17 seconds as Weidman broke his leg. The first kick by Weidman landed right below the knee of Hall just 13 seconds in. The kick ended the fight in grotesque fashion, as Weidman’s right leg snapped upon impact, and he collapsed to the canvas in agony. Hall was left in shock, quietly kneeling alone near the fence, facing away from the medical personnel attending to Weidman. Officially, it goes in the books as a 17-second TKO. Hall had waited nearly 11 years for a second shot at Weidman, whom he had met in 2010 in the Ring of Combat regional promotion, when both men were New York-area prospects. Weidman was in his third professional fight, Hall in his fifth. Both came in undefeated. Weidman won that one by first-round knockout, and went on to greater glory in the UFC, capturing the middleweight championship in 2013 with a stunning knockout of Anderson Silva, ending “The Spider’s” 17-fight winning streak. In recent years, though, the 36-year-old Weidman has struggled, and those struggles took a horrifying turn on this night. The loss was Weidman’s sixth in his last eight fights, a skid that began with his loss of the 185-pound belt in 2015. For Hall, also a 36-year-old New Yorker, it was his fourth straight victory. It was the second straight bout that was ended by a leg injury, as an Anthony Smith kick to the knee of Jimmy Crute had numbed the leg of the Australian light heavyweight, rendering him unable to continue after the first round. The Weidman injury was reminiscent of the broken leg suffered by Silva in his second fight with Weidman in 2013. Silva was never the same after that.
