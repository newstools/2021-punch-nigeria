The Bauchi State government has suspended indefinitely, an Islamic Cleric, over alleged incitement in his preachings. The suspension was contained in a media statement signed by the Commissioner, Ministry for Religious Affairs and Social Welfare, Ahmad Jalam, and addressed to the Islamic Cleric, Malam Abubakar Idris, Azare, Katagum Local Government Area of Bauchi State which was obtained by our correspondent on Thursday. According to the statement entitled: “Violation of the ethics of Preaching and Sermons in the state,” the Cleric was found to have been castigating companions of Prophet Muhammad in his preachings. This, the government said, was capable of instigating violence which will lead to the breakdown of the law and order in the state. The government, therefore, suspended him from preaching in any part of the state. The statement read in part, “The attention of the Bauchi State Government has been drawn to the manner of your preaching and sermons. “The report revealed that you are castigating the companions of our noble Prophet Muhammad (SAW) while conducting your preaching. “This attitude is a clear violation of the conduct and ethics of preaching, that is capable of raising people’s tension and certainly lead to the violation of law and order which the Government may not tolerate. “Consequently, you are suspended from conducting preaching and leading congregational prayers in any part of the State in the interest of peace.”
