DEPUTY Governor, of Benue State, Benson Abounu, on Thursday announced that he would only join the 2023 governorship race, if God, his principal, Governor Samuel Ortom and the people of the state, endorsed him. Abounu disclosed this when he played host to members of the Benue State Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists. He said he learnt from his principal (governor Ortom), that no one can get anything in life, unless God decreed it. Abounu said, “My decision to contest the governorship election in 2023 will be determined by three factors: God, Ortom and Benue people.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
