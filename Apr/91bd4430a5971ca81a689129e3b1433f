THERE are indications that the N5bn libel suit instituted by the Resident Electoral Commissioner in charge of Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Mike Igini, against former spokesman of the Edo State All Progressives Congress Media Campaign Council in the September 19 governorship election, Mr. John Mayaki, may be settled out of court as hearing was stalled in the case on Wednesday. When the case came up at the Benin High Court, counsel for Mayaki, Austin Osarenkhoe, informed the court that his client had reached the plaintiff (Mr. Igini) to opt for settlement. Osarenkhoe, therefore, asked the court for time to enable the parties to settle the matter out of court. Igini’s counsel, Christian Omatsone, did not oppose the defendant’s lawyer oral application. Consequently, the presiding Judge, Justice V. O. Oviawe, adjourned the suit to June 21, 2021 for report of settlement. Recall that‎ Igini had instituted the action following publications which alleged that he had a secret meeting with Governor Godwin Obaseki with a plot to rig the September 19, 2020 governorship election. He described the allegation as malicious, reckless, mischievous and with intent to destroy his hard-earned reputation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
