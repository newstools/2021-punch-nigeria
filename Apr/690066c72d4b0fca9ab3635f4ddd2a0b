The Primate of the African Church, His Eminence Julius Abbe, has asked Nigerians to seek God’s face over insecurity ravaging the country. Abbe said this during the activities to commemorate the church’s 120th Founders Day Anniversary on Thursday at the African Church Model College, Ifako-Ijaiye, Lagos. According to a statement, the anniversary’s theme is, ‘Firmly Rooted, Aiming Higher.’ Abbe said without seeking God’s face, the country might be unable to get out of the security challenges. “For us to grow in leaps and bounds, our roots must be very deep in Him. We must understand that without Him, we are nothing. It is only in Him that we can truly achieve our potential in life as individuals, one nation, and as a church,” he said. Abbe said the event was to appreciate God’s blessings upon the church, which will turn 120 on October 13. “The church came into existence on October 13, 1901, and has gone through many hurdles to get to where it is today, and it is no longer news that the church broke out of the Anglican Church (CMS). “It is obvious that the church owes its existence and growth to the Almighty God, and the love and mutual cooperation that exist among the members; both clergy and laity,” he said.
