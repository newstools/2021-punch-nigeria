THE Nigeria Labour Congress on Thursday said it would withdraw services from both public and private organisations in Kaduna State for five days to protest the mass sacking of workers by the state government. The decision to withdraw the services of workers was taken by the Central Working Committee of the NLC at a meeting in Abuja on Thursday. Addressing journalists at the end of the meeting, President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba, said the five-day withdrawal of service by workers in the state “will become total if there is no remorse from the state government.” The NLC president condemned the decision of Governor Nasir El-Rufai to sack close to 4,000 workers mostly from the 23 local government areas in the state. Wabba said, “CWC has decided and has also recommended to the National Executive Council that labour will withdraw all services from either public or private. “It is going to be a total action because we believe that El-Rufai is not alone in this action; neo-liberal forces and some governments are also part of it.” Copyright PUNCH.
