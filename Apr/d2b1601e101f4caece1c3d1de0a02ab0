THE Bayelsa State Government said it would soon relaunch the state-owned security outfit codenamed Operation Doo Akpo to complement the efforts of other security agencies in fighting crime in the state. The state Deputy Governor, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, announced this during a meeting with traditional rulers from the Yenagoa Local Government Area at the Government House, Yenagoa, on Tuesday. The security outfit, which was introduced by the immediate past administration of Seriake Dickson in 2012, became largely ineffective before the end of his tenure in February 2020. Ewhrudjakpo in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Doubara Atasi, restated the need for traditional rulers to be vigilant and take charge of security in their domains. Ewhrudjakpo said, “We are trying to revamp Doo Akpo. In the next couple of months, it will be back to its usual capacity of responding to distress calls promptly. They are being equipped.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
