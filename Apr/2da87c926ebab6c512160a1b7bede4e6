BARELY 24 hours after his suspension by the Governing Board, the registrar of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, Olatunbosun Odusanya, has been directed to appear before the disciplinary committee on Thursday (today), The PUNCH has learnt. Sources said on Wednesday that FUOYE senior staff members had been divided over the suspension, which they said, “took him by surprise.” Although Odusanya was said to have been suspended by the Governing Board of the institution over alleged misconduct, sources told The PUNCH that the suspension came in the wake of the arrival of the visitation panel. The Special Adviser (Media Matters) to the Vice-Chancellor, Wole Balogun, had said Odusanya was suspended to give room for an unhindered investigation into allegations of misconduct levelled against him over irregularities in recent appointments. She said, “The suspension of Odusanya has divided the senior management staff of FUOYE because of the manner the suspension was done, with many querying why it came in the wake of the arrival of the visitation panel. Is it a ploy to keep him away from the visitation panel?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
