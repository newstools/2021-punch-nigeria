Nigeria’s teenage table tennis sensation Musa Mustapha has been ranked world’s best in the boys’ U-11 by the International Table Tennis Federation. Mustapha becomes the second African to be rated number one in the world after Hana Goda was in 2020 named the best U-15 girls in the world. The Abuja-based Mustapha was part of the Nigerian team that won the 2019 ITTF Junior Circuit in Ghana, with the world table tennis body monitoring the player in the last three years, after he made his senior debut at the 2018 Nigeria Open in Lagos. In the rankings released by the ITTF, Mustapha, with 128 points, is number one in the U-11, while he is also ranked 17th in the U-13 category. The Al-Faizun Junior Academy pupil is expected to be part of the World Youth Series later in the year in Ivory Coast and Ghana. National junior champion Taiwo Matti is ranked 12th and 64th in the U-17 and U-19 world rankings respectively. According to ITTF, the new WTT Youth Series replaces the ITTF World Junior Circuit and is now complemented by the new ranking regulations. Portugal will host the first ever WTT Youth Series, with the inaugural WTT Youth Contender to take place in Vila Real from May 11 to 17. It’s the first youth table tennis event to be held since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
