Women in Ogun State under the aegis of the Women Association on Maternal Health, on Thursday, blamed the state government for neglecting the primary health centres in various parts of the state. The women, who spoke during a press conference in commemoration of the International Day of Maternal Health and Rights, attributed maternal mortality in the state to the poor state of primary health centres, especially in the rural areas. The women group, which comprises religious and social groups in the state, regretted that the primary health facilities were lacking in essential equipment to deliver basic health services, thereby endangering the lives of women during childbirth. Representing the Christian Association of Nigeria in the association, Beatrice Obafemi said, “Essential equipment to deliver basic obstetric emergency healthcare services is generally absent in all the primary healthcare facilities in the targeted local governments. “This lip service to the primary healthcare system for years shows the systemic weaknesses and long-term neglect of PHCs has left secondary health care in a comatose state.” Obafemi also stressed that there was an urgent need for the state government to upgrade the primary health post established 15 years ago to higher primary healthcare facilities to accommodate the increasing population.
