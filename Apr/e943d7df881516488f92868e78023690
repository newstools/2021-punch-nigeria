Entrepreneur and innovation writer, ‘Niyi Kolade, says the success of small and medium scale enterprises depend on the availability of energy in a country. Speaking with journalists in Ibadan while introducing his new book, ELITE – Entrepreneurship, Leadership, Innovation, Transformation and Energy, Kolade said the economy of any country thrives on favourable government policies and motivation offered to investors, while also calling on the investors to exploit all investment opportunities in the country. According to him, such a move would boost the nation’s economy and create employment opportunities for the youths. He said, “Because the economy thrives on entrepreneurship and energy, entrepreneurial creativity and energy availability are therefore the determinants of a country’s innovation index and largely, the dominant factors in economic performance. “Small and medium scale enterprises thrive more in developed economies due to the availability of resources, of which energy is chief. “A necessary digression is to look at the entrepreneur literally as an energy bank. Literarily, even inspiration is a form of energy and is a silent but salient resource that empowers the psyche of an entrepreneur for optimum output. “Motivation in terms of incentives, investment opportunities, favourable government policies and a conducive business environment determines the performance of an entrepreneur and the practice of entrepreneurship in different societies.” Kolade said his latest effort, ELITE, was a product of his desire to inspire people to contribute to economic development through creativity. He added, “There are seven pillars of entrepreneurship, which are also the topic of each of the seven chapters of the book. They are inspiration, imagination, implementation, invention, innovation, integration and improvement.”
