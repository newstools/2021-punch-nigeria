Mixta Africa has unveiled New Town Plots, a series of serviced commercial plots created to service light industrial, assembly and warehouse and logistics organisations/bodies. According to a statement issued by the company on Sunday, the plots are surrounded by notable residential estates such as Lakowe Lakes Golf and Country Estate, Beechwood Park, Beechwood Estate and Adiva. Mixta said the plots were centrally located within the Lagos New Town, a Mixta Africa development and community that has experienced immense growth over the years as a result of consistent infrastructural investments. It also stated that the LNT covered a total of 1561 hectares of land, with over 5000 development units sold. It is estimated to host over 50,000 people with an array of residential homes, malls, parks, religious houses, schools, community centres and more when fully developed. Speaking on the benefits of owning a New Town commercial plot, the company said customers would have proximity to Lekki Free Trade Zone and the Lekki-Epe Expressway, uncontested title to land, zero corporate income tax and withholding tax.
