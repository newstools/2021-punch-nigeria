The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, has said Nigeria must be deliberate about gas exploration and utilisation in order to unlock its huge reserves. Sylva said this while receiving the ‘Gas Decade Personality Award’ from the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria for his lead role in reinventing the country’s gas sector. A statement by the minister’s Special Assistant on Media and Public Affairs, Julius Bokoru, quoted the minister as saying, “We must begin to expand our gas capabilities; we must make gas exploration and utilisation as a country deliberate. “We must focus on gas; we must unlock our huge gas reserves as a way of diversifying the economy. I really appreciate this award and I promise that this will spur me to do even more for this country.” The President of OGTAN, Dr Mayowa Afe, speaking at the award ceremony at the NNPC Towers, Abuja, on Monday, praised Sylva’s dedication and innovation towards the Federal Government’s gas initiatives and policies. He said, “We are here to acknowledge what you have done for this country. You have brought sanity to the petroleum industry; you have also declared Nigeria, on behalf of the President, a gas-based nation. “We have looked at all you have done for the country and we have decided to honour you. On behalf of the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria, we have come to say you have done very well.” Afe was accompanied by key executives of OGTAN, including the incoming Vice President, Afolabi Davidson, and OGTAN’s manager, Chizoba Oduah.
