The verdict by the tribunal was delivered by a three-man panel led by Justice Umar Abubakar on Tuesday via zoom as the regular venue of the panel was not open due to the strike action embarked upon by members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria. The tribunal dismissed all the grounds of the PDP candidate’s petition for lack of merit. READ ALSO: Again, tanker explosion rocks Benue community
