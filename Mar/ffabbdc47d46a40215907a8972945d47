Dele Ogunyemi, Warri DEPUTY Senate President, Omo-Agege on Saturday hosted the non-indigenes across the state as part of efforts to mobilise support for candidates of the All Progressives Congress in the March 6, 2021 local government elections in Delta State. Several non-indigenes used the occasion to inform the lawmaker about the downtown of the economy and its effects on their livelihoods. Omo-Agege took time out to inaugurate a constituency office in Warri for Non-Indigenes Affairs for the Igbos, Yorubas, Hausas and other ethnic groups in Delta State. In response to their request for palliatives and support to revive their businesses, Omo-Agege said, “God willing, we will address the requests.” The Deputy Senate President urged the non-indigenes to come out enmasse on March 6 to vote for the candidates of All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Local Government polls. He also enjoined them to participate in the ongoing membership revalidation exercise within the APC saying the party needs increased membership towards the 2023 general elections. Copyright PUNCH.
