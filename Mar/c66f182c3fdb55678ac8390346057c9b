THE Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Monday, urged the party leadership to zone the 2023 presidency to the South-South. The state chairman of the party, Tony Aziegbemi, who made the appeal while addressing journalists in Benin, as part of activities to mark his first year in office, argued that the zone was shortchanged when President Goodluck Jonathan was denied a second term. He said, “As 2023 approaches, I humbly submit that our party has eminent men and women from across the six zones of the country that can lead us to victory. Our zone, South-South, I believe was short-changed when President (Goodluck) Jonathan was stopped from getting a second term. “With that in mind, and with the quality of leaders from the zone, we demand that our party, PDP, must zone the Presidency to the South-South to at least right the wrong that was inflicted on the zone. “Our Zone, South-South is the most ‘PDPcentric’ zone in the country with all the states being governed by PDP and all the governors performing excellently well. We wish to place on record that we are very proud of all our governors in the zone.” Earlier, members of‎ the Edo State executive of the PDP had a Thanksgiving service at the St. Maria Goretti Catholic Church, off Sakponba Road, Benin as part of activities to mark their one year in office.
