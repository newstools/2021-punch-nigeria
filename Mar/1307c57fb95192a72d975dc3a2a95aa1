Sunday Aborisade, Abuja THE Senator representing Osun West in the National Assembly, Adelere Oriolowo, has described as unfounded the fear that the admittance of Senator Iyiola Omisore into the All Progressives Congress will threaten the party’s unity. Oriolowo, who spoke to our correspondent in an interview in Abuja on Thursday, described Omisore’s entry into the APC as a welcome development. He said, “Rather than being anxious, party leaders and members in the state should see Omisore’s defection as a welcome idea and team up with such a fantastic politician to achieve the goals and objectives of the party. His defection cannot threaten the unity of the party in the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
