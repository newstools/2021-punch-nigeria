John Alechenu, Abuja There are strong indications that a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Oladimeji Bankole, is set to defect from the Action Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. This followed a meeting between Bankole, the Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; and his Jigawa State counterpart, Abubakar Badaru, in Abuja, on Friday. It was gathered that the three leaders met at Badaru’s private residence for a little over an hour behind closed doors. A picture of the meeting was shared on the party’s official WhatsApp group by the Director-General in charge of Media to the Yobe State Governor, Mallam Mohammed Mamman. In an accompanying statement, Mamman said, “The Chairman, APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni, today (Friday) hosted former Speaker, House of Representatives, Oladimeji Bankole, and Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Badaru. “The three leaders discussed a wide range of political issues, including the movement of the former Speaker and his supporters into the party. It is evident that APC’s opportunities in Ogun State are growing and widening. “It would be recalled that a former Governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, who was once a former Director-General of Peoples Democratic Party’s Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organisation, has recently joined the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
