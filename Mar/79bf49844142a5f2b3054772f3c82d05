Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate on Wednesday mandated its Committee on Power to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Power to take necessary steps towards the immediate completion of the Abadigba-Egwuwe power project in Kogi State. The upper chamber passed the resolution sequel to the consideration of a motion to that effect during plenary. The motion was titled ‘The need for immediate completion of the Abadigba-Egwuwe Power Plant Project in Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State.” It was sponsored by Senator Isah Jibrin, an All Progressives Congress member representing Kogi East Senatorial District. Jibrin noted that sometime in 2007, the Federal Government embarked on a power plant project at Abadigba-Egwuwe in Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State to light up Kogi East Senatorial District, against the backdrop of the persistent poor power supply to the area. He further noted that the project advanced with the installation of various equipment including three giant power plants and two transformers in readiness for connection with Geregu Power Station at Ajaokuta. The lawmaker expressed concern that “the project has become one of the abandoned projects in the country as no effort has been made to complete it in line with the laudable intentions of the government, 13 years after initiating it.” The senator said completing the Abadigba power project would boost production activities and economic development.
