The company also said it was celebrating achievements and acknowledging the increasing visibility of women in every sphere of the company’s operations. A statement on Friday from the insurer titled ‘SUNU Assurances celebrates women’, said it was observing International Women’s Day. The Managing Director, SUNU, Mr Samuel Ogbodu, at the company’s celebration of 2021 International Women’s Day said women in the company were setting new records and achievements.

According to him, the company took pride in their many accomplishments and was determined to work towards furthering women empowerment across a wide range of the sector. He said, “We are celebrating all SUNU Assurances women. We stand with women and believe that there is no limit to what they can and should achieve. “We take pride in their many accomplishments and we are determined to work towards furthering women empowerment across a wide range of the sector. “The area of concern is women’s economic participation and opportunity as they face greater hurdles than men in almost all spheres of economic activity, including access to finance.” He added that within the company, efforts were targeted towards encouraging the hiring of women and improving their working conditions.
