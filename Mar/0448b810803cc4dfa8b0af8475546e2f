Manufactured goods valued at N577.61bn were unsold last year as the COVID-19 hit patronage, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said on Tuesday. MAN, in its bi-annual review of the economy, said the inventory of unsold finished manufactured goods increased to N303.22bn in the second half of 2020 from N202.16bn in the same period of 2019 and N275.39bn in the first half of 2020. “Inventory of unsold manufactured goods in the sector totaled N577.61bn in 2020 as against N402.42bn recorded in 2019,” it said. The association said the increase in inventory in the period was attributed to the general low consumption and renewed imports in the economy as global economies generally opened after months of lockdown. It said, “Electrical and electronic sectoral group accounted for over 33 per cent of the total inventory of unsold manufactured products in period. “The group are having the challenges of low patronage, high smuggling and products counterfeiting which rubbed off negatively on inventory.” MAN said a total of 3,903 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector in the second half of last year, noting that the pandemic had a crushing impact on the sector. “At the moment and following the impact of COVID-19, productivity in the sector is at the lowest,” it said, adding that the sector required deliberately orchestrated action to rekindle significant productive activities. It said at the end of the second half of 2020, an estimated 1,655,331 historical cumulative jobs were created in the sector in the last eight years. “A total of 3,451 new manufacturing jobs were created in the second half of 2020 compared to 10,735 jobs created in the corresponding half of 2019 and 5,241 jobs in the first half of the year. However, a total of 3,903 jobs were lost in the sector in the period,” MAN said. According to the report, manufacturing investment declined to N56.44bn in the second half of 2020 from N257.66bn recorded in the corresponding half of 2019 and N62.08bn in the first half of 2020. It said, “Manufacturing investment totaled N118.52bn in 2020 as against N496.11bn achieved in 2019. “Manufacturing investment declined in the period following the depressing fallouts from COVID-19 that gave no impetus for new investments in the sector.” The association said manufacturing production value declined to N2.36tn in the second half of 2020 from N7.38tn in the corresponding half of 2019. It said, “However, it increased by N0.32tn or 15.5 per cent when compared with N2.04tn recorded in the first half of the year. Production value in the sector totalled N4.4tn in 2020 as against N11.99tn achieved in 2019. “The uptick in manufacturing production in the second half over the performance in the first half of the year was due to the opening up of the economy for businesses after over five months of lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.” MAN said electricity supply from the distribution companies to the sector increased to 12 hours on daily average in the second half of last year from 10 hours per day on the average in the first half. It however said expenditure on alternative energy in the period under review increased to N57.75bn from N34.70bn in the same period of 2019 and N24.16bn in the first half of 2020. Copyright PUNCH.
