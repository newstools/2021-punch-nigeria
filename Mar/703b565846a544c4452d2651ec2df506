On Twitter, one @shola_ebenezer said, “His case will soon be transferred to Abuja, and nothing will happen due to lack of diligent prosecution from the police. The FG may even have to pay him for detaining him without reasonable course. No be today e start.” @HakaRedline said, “The IGP will call for his case file, he would be transferred to Abuja and that’ll be the end. He’d be released. This is how Nigeria is.” @solex5k said, “I am pretty sure that Mr PRESIDENCY will set him free, watch out.” READ ALSO: United win 2-0 in derby against City @herculean_me said, “Watch and see FG and its agencies do everything possible to put a twist to this and to secure the release of the murderous kidnappers.
