Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The police in Ekiti State say they are on the trail of yet-to-be-identified persons who stabbed a 45-year-old woman, Mrs Motunrayo Olajide, to death inside her house in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, said on Friday that the law enforcement agents had yet to make any arrest in connection with the murder. The mother of three was allegedly killed at her residence on 2nd Avenue, Aseye Street, Nova, Adebayo area of Ado Ekiti metropolis on Monday. Abutu said, “The woman was stabbed with a sharp object on her neck, which pierced the skin and created a deep cut that led to her bleeding to death. Police detectives have launched serious investigations into the matter to unravel those behind the dastardly act. “The remains of the woman have been deposited in a morgue while investigations continue. We are awaiting the outcome of the autopsy that will be performed by experts and guide us in determining the true cause of the woman’s death. “We appeal to residents and neighbours of the deceased who have relevant information that can help our investigation to feel free to provide such.” Sources said the woman was found dead in a pool of blood around 4.50pm on Monday, when the deceased’s 11-year old daughter returned from school and met her mother’s lifeless body on the floor. The source said, “The killers seized the opportunity that the woman was always at home to strike and kill her. Her daughter raised the alarm and neighbours rushed there. We saw her in a pool of blood with a deep cut on her neck. The landlords in the area quickly ran to the police station to report the incident.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
