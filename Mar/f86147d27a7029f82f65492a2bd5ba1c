Kayode Oyero Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Friday, said the Agege-Pen Cinema Bridge was at 20% completion when he took over the wheel of governance from his predecessor, Akinwumi Ambode, in May 2019. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Ambode, who started the 1.4 kilometre-long bridge in 2017, was conspicuously absent when Sanwo-Olu; All Progressives Congress stalwart, Bola Tinubu; and other prominent politicians inaugurated the Agege-Pen Cinema Bridge on Friday. Ambode lost his re-election bid in 2019 due to intra-party wrangling in the APC within the state. Ambode has not also been seen at any state function with Sanwo-Olu or Tinubu since he exited government in May 2019.
