One person has been killed and 15 others abducted after a communal clash between Ugbo community, in the Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, and Ikpanja, in the Ibiono Ibom LGA of Akwa Ibom State. Residents of Ugbo appealed to the Abia State Government to come to their rescue to avert further loss of lives. A community leader, Mazi Jerry Onwumere, who spoke to journalists, said more lives might be lost if nothing was done to address the situation.
