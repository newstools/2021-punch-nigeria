Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has said keeping pilgrims fund in the newly introduced Hajj Savings Scheme is safe, reliable and free from any unforeseen temptation. According to a statement from Jaiz Bank Plc titled ‘Pilgrims funds safer in Hajj Savings account – Gov. Sule’, the governor spoke on Thursday. The statement said while speaking at the launch/sensitisation of the scheme in Lafia, Nasarawa State, Sule said beside easing the hajj processes, it would reduce the chances of redirecting the pilgrims’ funds for other activities outside hajj operations. He said the HSS came at the right time when various governments were withdrawing gradually from sponsoring religious activities, and that Muslims would now be better prepared at their convenience to perform Hajj which was one of the pillars of Islam. The Managing Director, Jaiz Bank Plc, Mallam Hassan Usman, said, “The bank is committed to this journey and we are ready to support it with best-in-class technology infrastructure as well as safe investment management practice.” Hassan, who was represented by the acting Managing Director/Executive Director, Operations/Chief Finance Officer of the Bank, Abdulfattah Amoo, said the scheme grows over time.
