Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Commissioner of Police, Nasiru Muhammed, has vowed to arrest and prosecute those who razed the police division, the council secretariat, magistrate and high courts in Ishinweke town in the Ihitte-Uboma Local Government Area. The CP, who spoke on Wednesday when he visited the police station at Ishinweke, which was burnt by hoodlums on Tuesday, said “two wrongs can’t make a right.” Muhammed also condemned the alleged killing of 32-year-old Chinanu Okonkwo, adding that those who set the public facilities ablaze would be made to face the full wrath of the law. The police chief said, “This is the third police division that has been attacked since I assumed office as the Commissioner of Police in Imo State. “Two wrongs can’t make a right. No matter the provocation, it is wrong to take the law into your own hands to the extent of burning the local government area headquarters and the courts. “We will not allow those who did this to get away with them. They must face the full wrath of the law.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
