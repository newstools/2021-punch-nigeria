Dayo Ojerinde and Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos, on Thursday, set aside its order of interim forfeiture on the properties of Senator Olubukola Saraki, located on 17 and 17A MacDonald Road, Ikoyi, Lagos State. The judgment came after counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mr Nnaemeka Omewa, and counsel for Saraki, Mr Kehinde Ogunwumiju, SAN, had adopted their respective written addresses for and against the final forfeiture order sought by the EFCC.

Liman said the applicant had in its affidavit in support of its motion for final forfeiture stated that the properties sought to be forfeited were purchased with a personal loan that Saraki obtained from Guaranty Trust Bank. “The evidence of the transactions presented by the applicant was in respect of transactions made after he had purchased the property and the proceeds used for the purchase were legal; that is loan.
