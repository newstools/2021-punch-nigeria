Adeyinka Adedeipe, Benin A former Chief Security Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Mr. Haruna Abiona, has demanded N3.6bn from the Edo State Caretaker Committee Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, Col. David Imuse, (retd.), and three others for defamation of character. Haruna, in a letter endorsed by his counsel, Ainabeholo Oseikhuemen, asked the APC chieftains,  including Tony Kabaka Adun, Emperor Jarret Tenebe, State Deputy Chairman, Edo North and Adams Shaba, President, Professional Drivers on Wheels, to tender an apology and retract defamatory statements and publications against him within 14 days. The lawyer said, “Our client will sue the four APC stalwarts to N3.5bn over false and malicious publications they deliberately made in various media if a retraction is not done within the time given.” He claimed that the four APC leaders published  malicious statements against him “on the Internet and other social media platforms as well as in the prints and broadcast media stations. “Some of the false and malicious publications are that you falsely describe our client, Haruna Yusuf Abiona as the mastermind behind the mayhem and terror unleashed at the front of the palace of the Oba of Benin.” Copyright PUNCH.
