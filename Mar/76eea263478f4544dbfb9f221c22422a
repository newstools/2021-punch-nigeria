Nigerians on Sunday took to social media to upload heartfelt messages to mark Mother’s Day. Mother’s Day is a day to celebrate mothers the world over. It is a celebration of motherhood, maternal ties, and the all-too-important influence of mothers in society. Although celebrated on different days in many parts of the world, it most commonly marked in the months of March or May. @dawn_immanuel wrote in near lyrical language, “To the mums who hold their children in their arms, and the mums who carry theirs in their hearts. “To the mums who are waiting patiently, and the ones who are tired of waiting. “To mums of one, and mums of many; mums by choice, and mums by chance: Happy Mother’s Day.” “We should celebrate Mother’s Day Everyday…,” declared @Missifyfelix, “Mothers are just the BEST!!! “Happy Mother’s Day to every Mother, May God continually strengthen you all in Jesus name”. @AYOMIDEAYOOLA08 wrote, “Happy Mother’s Day To All The Sweet And Amazing Mother In The Whole Wide World..May You All Live Long To Reap The Fruit Of Your Labor”. @MAnabraba lauded his spouse, noting that, “On this mother’s day Sunday, l want to appreciate my queen, gorgeous wife and close confidant, for making our beloved family, the hub of her decision making.” @MojiDelanoBlog wrote, “It’s #MothersDay2021! At least the first one. Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing mums, and aspiring Mums. We are life-givers, game-changers! May we reap the fruits of our labour, in good health of mind and body, AMEN. God bless and keep us always”. “Happy Mother’s Day to the absolute love of my life. I really do not know how I’d navigate through life without my mother, love her too much,” wrote @kofoworola_aa. Although there are older traditions similar to the celebration, Mother’s Day is said to originate in the United States in the early 1900s. The first Mother’s Day was celebrated in 1908, when Anna Jarvis honored her mother, Ann Jarvis, with a memorial.
