More than a month after escaping while being unloaded at a slaughterhouse, a cow weighing 725.7478kg is still roaming the streets of Johnston, about 10 miles west of Providence in the American State of Rhode Island. Police said Wednesday in a Facebook post that although they’ve been keeping loose track of its whereabouts, they can’t chase it, so their goal is to keep it contained to wooded areas where it can’t endanger drivers or itself, TODAY has reported. The medium reports that on February 4, after the animal first bolted when a wholesaler lost control of it outside Rhode Island Beef & Veal in Johnston, a startled Uber driver reported seeing it hoofing its way through an intersection as he was waiting for a traffic light to change. It later was sighted in Providence, where local authorities contacted the Department of Environmental Management and animal control. Neither agency had the resources to capture and transport the animal, according to a police report. Authorities are urging anyone who sees it to alert police and not attempt to corral it themselves.” Stay clear of the steer,” they posted. “Please leave the capture to professionals.” In a statement to the medium, a Farm Sanctuary spokesperson said that many times when a farm animal is found roaming the streets, the animal has “likely escaped a traumatic situation propelled by their strong desire to live.” “They are likely exhausted, hungry, and afraid,” the spokesperson said. “They may also be severely distrustful of people since they have likely come from the animal agriculture industry, which treats animals like unfeeling commodities instead of the emotional beings they are. “Chances are these courageous animals have been wandering with no access to shelter or food for days, weeks, or even months,” Farm Sanctuary added.
