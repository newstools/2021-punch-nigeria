The National Health Insurance Scheme will play an important role in rebuilding healthcare infrastructure in the North-East destroyed by Boko Haram insurgents, its Executive Secretary, Prof. Mohammed Samba, has said. A statement on Thursday by the Head, Media and Public Affairs, NHIS, Emmanuel Ononokpono, said Sambo said this in Abuja when a high-level delegation from Borno State Government paid him a courtesy visit. He stressed the importance of putting in place an effective healthcare financing system, adding that development would not be balanced without infrastructure to support critical services such as healthcare. He said, “The intervention of NHIS through its various service platforms will improve the health indices in the North-East region.” Sambo added that its state offices across the country were being strengthened with skilled and relevant personnel, as well as infrastructure, to address identified shortcomings in the 36 states and the FCT. Speaking earlier, the leader of the delegation, Prof. Isa Marte Hussaini, who is the Chief of Staff to the Governor of Borno State expressed regrets over the damage caused by insurgency in the state. He said that healthcare infrastructure such as hospitals have been destroyed in the decade-long battle against insurgents. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
