Five persons, who were abducted along the Wukari Ibi Road in Taraba State on Monday, have regained their freedom. The Chairman, Wukari Local Government Council, Mr Daniel Adi, disclosed this in a telephone interview with our correspondent. Adi said the victims were freed after their families paid N1mn to the abductors as ransom. He stated, “The victims were freed in the early hours of today (Thursday) after N1m was paid to the Fulani herdsmen, who kidnapped them. “Initially, the abductors were demanding N5m as ransom, but on hearing that Army personnel were combing the forest and closing up on them, they quickly opted for N1m in order to escape. “As part of measures to check cases of kidnapping in the area, we held a security meeting yesterday (Wednesday) where it was resolved that the Fulani chiefs and district heads in whose domain any future kidnapping takes place shall be held liable.” Adi named the freed victims as Godwin Joel, Matthew Titus, Baba Kundi, James Dayoung and Sadiyanati Isiaka.
