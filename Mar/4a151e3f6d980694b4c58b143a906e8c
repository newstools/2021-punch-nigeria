Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi BORNO State Governor, Babagana Zulum, on Thursday, announced that his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, would soon leave the Peoples Democratic Party to join the All Progressives Congress. Zulum said this while speaking during a groundbreaking for the reconstruction and upgrading of the Bauchi State Government House in Bauchi. Zulum, who is the Chairman of the North East Governors’ Forum, said, “I want to express my appreciation to my colleague, the governor of Bauchi State and my other colleagues, for giving me the support to take the North-East Governors’ (Forum) to a greater height and indeed to the next level. “The only quarrel that I am having with my colleague, the governor of Bauchi State, is his refusal to come into the APC. “But insha Allah, very soon, he will join us. He’ll join the progressives. I am here to support him.” When contacted, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said, “All we can say is that Zulum’s statement about our Bauchi State governor is wishful thinking.” Copyright PUNCH.
