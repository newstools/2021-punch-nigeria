Tukur Muntari, Kano A Chief Magistrate Court in Kano on Friday ordered the state government to maintain a status-quo regarding anything to do with the embattled Islamic Cleric, Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara whom the court has stopped from preaching pending determination of a case against him. Recall that Kano State Government had last week fixed Sunday, March 7, 2021, for debate between some Islamic clerics and Sheikh Nasiru Kabara. The state and the Magistrate Court had barred the cleric from preaching over an alleged comment that is injurious to peaceful coexistence in the state.

However, a legal practitioner, Barrister Maaruf Yakasai had filed a suit to be joined in the matter demanding the court to stop the debate as it violates its earlier order stopping Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara from preaching. Yakasai represented by Barrister Lukman Abdullahi said his client, the applicant is an interested party in the suit, as a concerned citizen of Nigeria, a Muslim and indigene of Kano state.
