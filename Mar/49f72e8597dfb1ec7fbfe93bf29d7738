The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Monday said the Federal Government had allocated 0.5 per cent of the country’s annual Gross Domestic Product to improve investments and aid the development of science, technology and innovation in Nigeria. He said the investment in STI was in line with the African Union resolution that member nations should invest at least one per cent of their respective nations’ GDPs to the development of science, technology and innovation. Buhari, who was represented by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, disclosed this at the opening ceremony of the 2021 Science and Technology EXPO in Abuja. In a statement issued by the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology in Abuja, the President said the science and technology EXPO should serve as vanguard to establish Nigeria’s economy as an innovation driven one. This came as the Federal Government granted full scholarship up to doctorate degree level to three secondary school students who emerged winners at this year’s Young Nigerian Scientists Presidential Award Competition. The scholarship is in any science-related discipline of their choice at any university across the country. The three students are Edanya Ugochukwu from Enugu; Akinwande Oluwatomisin; Ondo, and Emmanuel Imeh, FCT, who came 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
