The Chief Executive Officer, NSE, Mr Oscar Onyema, at the 2020 Market Recap and 2021 Outlook in January, noted that for the second consecutive year, equity market transactions were dominated by domestic investors who accounted for 65.28 per cent of market turnover by value while foreign portfolio investors accounted for 34.72 per cent. On the outlook for this year, he said, “We expect the marginal reopening of businesses, normalisation of the economy and revenue-diversification drive of the Nigerian government to elicit positive sentiments throughout the year. “Our growth expectations should be noted with caution, as the recent second wave of COVID-19 in Nigeria and globally may slow down renewed social and economic activities.” Copyright PUNCH.
