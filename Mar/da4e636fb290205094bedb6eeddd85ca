The Federal Government on Thursday charged the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science to come up with practicable models that would end the incessant clashes between farmers and herders across the country. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, gave the charge in Abuja during the inauguration of the 5th council of the NIAS. He said, “The institute must not shy away from playing a deserved lead role in proffering the needed solution to the current burning issue of incessant conflicts between herders and sedentary farming communities in Nigeria. “Land resource is indeed scarce and not expandable, but science has proven that we can generate all we need with renewable agricultural strategies for both crop and livestock production from the available land resource without any form of conflict. “I strongly call on the institute to come up with scientific and practicable models that the government can adopt to finally lay to rest this front-burning problem.” Nanono said the nation needed to quickly transit from its current conflict era to becoming a net exporter of premium beef.
