Grace Edema The United Nations, Women, has said females are high achievers when in leadership position. A representative of the UN, Women, Ms Deodata Mukazayire, at a webinar organised by United Nations Association of Nigeria, thereby requested that special measures should be put in place to create opportunities for more women to get into leadership positions. The webinar which was titled, ‘Women in Leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 World,’ was organised to celebrate the International Women’s Day 2021 and the  Women in Leadership Award. Mukazayire said, “Women have been on the frontline, they are among the leaders who have kept the COVID-19  prevalence lower and help reduce the spread of COVID-19; we are seeing it in UN leadership too. When women lead in government we see progress. If they are in the parliamentary, the country adopts more stringent climate change policy. Men are essential part of our society but special measures to get more women into leadership should be encouraged.” Secretary-General of UNAN, Mrs Joan Agha, said society should stand up for women’s right and gender equality. “Throughout history, women have had to fight for their right. We enjoy all the good things today due to on the action of some brave women and men.  It is remarkable to see women achieve leadership roles, women leaders have demonstrated their skills to lead.” CEO, Futuresoft, Nkemdilim Uwaje-Begho, advised women to be intentional in building their own personal brand.
