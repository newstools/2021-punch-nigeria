Leaders of thought in Yoruba land are billed to deliberate on insecurity in the nation in general and the South-West in particular in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Wednesday, March 17, 2021. The stakeholders are expected to meet under the auspices of the Pan Yoruba Congress. A statement signed by the Congress Committee Chairman, Ogbeni Sola Lawal, on Thursday read that the meeting would hold at the Mapo Hall by 11am on the said date. It is believed that the meeting is connected to the increasing spate of banditry, kidnappings and killings in the land, as well as the problem of herdsmen encroachment and destruction of farmlands. The rising ethnic tension and violence being experienced in the zone is also expected to be brought to fore. According to the statement, dignitaries expected at the event include Yoruba leaders in all facets of human engagements such as traditional, political, religious, business and social among others. It pointed out that the event would set the agenda for comprehensive safety and security across the zone as allowed within the ambit of the law of the nation. The statement reads partly, “Everything is set for the historic gathering. The Pan Yoruba Congress is about our unity as a race. It is about our destiny and it is about our stake in securing in the South-West and making our region safe for all and sundry.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
