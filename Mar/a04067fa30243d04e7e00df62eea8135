Dayo Ojerinde General health physicians, Ola Apata and Olusegun Olukunle, have advised Nigerians on the need to go for regular check-ups. The experts spoke on the sidelines of a medical fair organised by the Patent Pathways International Foundation in partnership with Ebuntayo Schools in Ijegun Egba area of Lagos State. Apata noted that the medical outreach was the Foundation’s way of giving back to society. He lamented Nigeria’s attitude of not going for regular check-ups, saying this would not allow them to detect an ailment at an early stage. “Most people don’t go for routine check-ups; some people have not been to the hospital for the past three years. Because of this, so many people do not know their health status. “Part of what we are doing is to raise the awareness on the need to go for regular check-ups. Some people think going to the hospital takes fortunes, at times you just walk in and may not take more than just getting a hospital card. In the process, there could be a finding that could be beneficial, that could save a dangerous situation. “Some people are hypertensive, but they are not aware because they don’t go for regular check-ups,” he said. Also, Olukunle said early detection was key to treating and managing ailments. He said, “A lot of Nigerians are moving around without knowing they have one medical issue or the other. Once you go for a check-up, you will be able to find out if you are at risk of a certain ailment. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
