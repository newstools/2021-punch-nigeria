The senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for Ogun East in the 2019 general elections, Adeola Sosanwo, has defected to the All Progressives Congress. Sosanwo said he joined the APC to collaborate with the State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun. He said, “I have always been an APC person but was hijacked by the PDP due to the fact that I wasn’t getting due recognition under the previous government of Senator Ibikunle Amosun. “I have, however, decided to be back to the APC to support our good brother, the governor of the state, Prince Dapo Abiodun, in his determination to leave the state far better than he met it.” He commended the governor for raising the bar of good governance in the state to secure its economic prosperity. Sosanwo added, “Look at the idea of the resuscitated Agro-Cargo Airport at Iperu Remo, the Olokola LNG, the massive road infrastructure cutting across the state, such as the nearly completed Epe-Ijebu Ode 10-lane project.    ,,
