Temiloluwa O’Peters Lafarge Africa Plc has committed a total of $8m to change its current Electrostatic Precipitator to bag house in its Ewekoro plant. According to a statement from the group on Monday, this entails making significant adjustments including the shutting down of its kilns for at least six months to make the improvement. The Chief Executive Officer, Lafarge Africa, Khaled El-Dokani, said the investment underscored the company’s commitment to environmental sustainability. He said the group’s goal was to pioneer the transformation of the local building materials and construction sector in Nigeria to address important environmental issues, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. El-Dokani also said the LAP was increasingly using biomass, including oil palm and rice husks, as alternative fuels to power its plants. The CEO said, “Currently, a good number of cement plants in Nigeria are powered by coal, gas or low pour fuel oil. “However, alternative fuels are considered cleaner, more sustainable, and also help surrounding communities dispose of waste more efficiently. “Considering this, alternative fuels currently account for up to 40 per cent of fuel used to power Lafarge Africa’s Ewekoro plant and the company plans to have all plants operating on at least 35 per cent alternative fuels by 2023.” The company added that a number of initiatives directed towards health and safety, education, rural electrification, infrastructure and environmental sustainability across several communities have been executed.
