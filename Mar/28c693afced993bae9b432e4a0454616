Pandemonium broke out in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Thursday evening as hoodlums attacked the popular masquerader called Oloolu in the city. Our correspondent gathered that two persons were killed while one was missing as gun-wielding hoodlums waylaid the masquerader and his followers in the Oje area. It was learnt that although the Oloolu usually goes out around July, the masquerader went out on Thursday around 6pm to make some rituals to appease the gods so that rain could fall. However, the hoodlums were said to have waylaid the masquerader and prevented him from laying down the sacrifice at the designated point. One of the acolytes of the Oloolu told our correspondent that the hoodlums caned and shot at the masquerader and his followers. He said, “The hoodlums came and started shooting. They were led by one youth called Star Boy. They injured many people but Baba (Oloolu) was not injured. “I don’t know why they attacked us but those youths are hoodlums. The DPO at Agugu did very well; he was the one that rescued Baba from the attackers. “They killed one of us yesterday (Thursday) and one person is missing. Another member who was attacked died this morning (Friday).” The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Mr Olugbenga Fadeyi, confirmed the attack to our correspondent, adding that one person was shot dead. He said, “Information received revealed that some hoodlums attacked Oloolu masquerader at the Oje Eleni, Ibadan at about 7pm on 11/03/2021 when he was performing his annual sacrifice. “One person was shot dead. Police detectives intensified efforts to arrest perpetrators of the crime with a view to bringing them to book.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
