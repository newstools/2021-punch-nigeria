Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government has replaced the emergency travel certificate with a temporary passport for security reasons. The temporary passport is a new genre of travel document that will be issued at the Nigerian Embassies abroad to Nigerians wishing to return home but whose national passport was not available. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, inaugurated the temporary passport at the Nigeria Immigration Service headquarters, Abuja on Tuesday.
