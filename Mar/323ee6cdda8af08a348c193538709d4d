Tony Okafor, Awka THE Anambra State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has berated the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige and the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, over their comments to deploy ‘seen and unseen forces’ to win the November 6 for All Progressives Congress. Anambra state Chairman of PDP, Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu, described the comments as an open admission of a plot to use undemocratic means to grab power. Nwobu spoke while receiving a donation of 21 Toyota Sienna Sports Utility Vehicles, from one of the party’s governorship aspirants, Dr Winston Udeh, at the PDP State Secretariat in Awka, on Saturday. Ngige and Uzodimma, had on different occasions, said they would use ‘seen and unseen forces’ to ensure that APC won the November poll. Nwobu said, “We are not under a military regime. So, I don’t know what they are taking over. And their seen and unseen hands, if he is expectant of his ‘Supreme Court judgment’ he should be told point blank that that is not possible in Anambra.” While donating the vehicles, Udeh said, “Wherever you go, they will (supporters) ask you for transport fare. And I kept wondering, does it mean that all these years that the PDP does not have vehicles it uses for its daily operation especially at the Local Government Areas?” “I decided it will be good to provide cars for all the 21 Local Government Areas in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
