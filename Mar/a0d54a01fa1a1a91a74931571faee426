’Femi Asu The newly inaugurated President of the Nigeria Gas Association, Ed Ubong, has said there is abundant gas resources in Nigeria to meet the energy demand of over 350 million people and the industrial needs in the West African sub-region. “Nigeria, which ranks as the 9th largest gas reserve in the world and clearly the largest in West Africa, therefore, needs to develop this resource base and connect the existing local supply and demand with physical and virtual pipeline infrastructure, while also exploring closer integration of roads, seaports and rail infrastructure,” Ubong said. He was quoted in a statement as saying this at NGA’s 12th International Conference and Industry Awards in Lagos last week. Ubong, who is also the managing director of Shell Nigeria Gas Limited, however, advocated an improved investment climate for the gas sector to further develop infrastructure along the gas value chain and enable the expansion of the gas networks to cover West Africa countries.
