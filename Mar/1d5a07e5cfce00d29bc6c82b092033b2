The Federal Government has directed the Nigerian Embassy in Benin Republic to offer consular services to Ogun community residents who fled to the francophone country on account of the attacks by herdsmen. The Director of Consular Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Bolaji Akinremi, said the ministry was expecting a feedback from the mission on the directive. Residents of Agbon-Ojodu, Moro, Asa,  Ibeku and some other villages in Yewa Local Government Area of Ogun State had abandoned their communities and took refuge in neighbouring Benin Republic following incessant attacks by armed herdsmen. Over 20 persons have been reportedly killed by the criminals who also grazed their animals on farms in the agrarian communities. Following the failure of the federal and state governments to protect the beleaguered communities, some of their members were said to have sought shelter in Benin. The Senate had on Wednesday asked the Federal Government to direct officials of the National Emergency Management Agency and Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, to bring back the people. But Akinremi told our correspondent on Thursday that the embassy had been directed to offer assistance to the people. He stated, “We have asked our mission to seek them out and also to see to their welfare. The mission is expected to attend to those in distress. The mission would also provide update to the headquarters on the matter.” When asked what the government was doing to bring the people back, the MFA spokesman, Ferdinand Nwonye, pleaded for time to get the information from the appropriate department.
