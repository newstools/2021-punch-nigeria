Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo NATIONAL Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has downplayed the crisis rocking the South West chapter of the party. He described it as normal in politics. Secondus also dismissed as speculative claims that some of the party members were planning to leave as a result of the crisis. The party national chairman, spoke through the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Diran Odeyemi, during an interdenominational prayer meeting organised by the Sunday Bisi-led Osun PDP executives, at the party secretariat, in Osogbo, on Monday. Secondus said, “There is no crises at all in South West PDP. When there is an election anywhere in the world and you have one or two people contesting for positions, there are bound to be misunderstandings. But as soon as the election is conducted, whoever emerges as the candidate, or as the winner, all others will rally round him. “As far as we are concerned, nobody is planning to decamp among the warring parties and inasmuch as that is not happening, we will continue to talk among ourselves and if it is by election, we will go for the election peacefully, whoever emerges we will all embrace and come back together.” In an interview with newsmen shortly after the event, the Osun PDP chairman, Sunday Bisi, admitted that there were internal issues within the party but said such issues were being addressed.
