Tony Okafor, Awka THE National Chairman of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, Chief Victor Oye, has revealed that the party has engaged in prayers to seek divine guidance in the choice of the standard bearer for the Anambra State Governorship Election, scheduled for November 6, 2021. Oye said this while speaking to journalists, in Amawbia, Awka South Local Government Area of Anambra State on Sunday. He said, “We follow the INEC timetable. INEC said from June10 to July 3, you should be able to conduct your primaries and produce a candidate and that is what we are going to work with. Every other thing is speculation. “Our candidate will emerge between June 10 and July 3. We are law abiding; we follow due process. We have been in prayer; prayer is the force that moves the hand that rules the world. We believe that at the fullness of time, God will bring the anointed candidate for us. “We’re convinced that God will give us a veritable, judicious, prudent, careful, visionary, God fearing leader that will take over from Obiano. We are confident about that, that’s why while others are jostling and making noise, we are praying, seeking the face of God. It’s only Him that can give us a successor to Obiano. It is not something that can be done by our own making.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
