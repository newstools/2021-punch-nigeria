The Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas has disclosed plans to grow the potentials of Bonny Island, its host community, in Rivers State, in order to transform the place into an international tourism destination. The General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Mrs Eyono Fatayi-Williams, stated this at the end of a two-week intensive and hands-on training on tourism business and entrepreneurship for some Bonny youths in partnership with Goge Africa in Bonny, Rivers State. Fatayi-Williams said the initiative was part of the company’s Bonny-Dubai vision aimed at diversifying the economy of Bonny, its operation area from reliance on oil and gas to tourism. She said, “The Bonny-Dubai Vision is a strategic development intervention by NLNG that seeks to make Bonny a major international investment destination by the year 2040. “We aim to diversify the Island’s economy, especially with Bonny’s rich potential from its unique history, culture, and traditions, from reliance on oil and gas activities to other areas such as tourism.” Fatayi-Williams said the training was to equip the youths with skills to enable them to function as tour guides and champions of tourism, especially in the areas of culture and eco-tourism.
