Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Sunday said it would avoid repeating its oil sector mistakes in the mining industry. Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, said this in a statement issued in Abuja by an official of the Press and Public Relations department of his ministry, Tony Ekpo. Adegbite also stated that the Federal Government would give necessary support to investors who were keen in investing in the Nigerian minerals sector. He spoke during a working visit to the mining site of Multiverse Mining and Exploration Plc located in Awe Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. The minister was quoted as saying, “We have made mistakes in the oil sector, where the oil companies prosper and the communities are impoverished. “We want to avoid that pitfall in the mining sector, hence, as the company prospers, the community also prospers.” The minister expressed satisfaction with the company’s activities, which, he said, was in line with the Federal Government’s initiative to diversify the economy through the mining sector. Adegbite noted that Multiverse Mining and Exploration was one of the successful stories in the sector that would encourage other investors to invest in the industry. Copyright PUNCH.
