Dele Ogunyemi, Warri DELTA State candidate of the All Progressives Congress, in the March 2019 gubernatorial election, Chief Great Ogboru, has said the ongoing membership registration/ revalidation exercise will put the party in a position to reassess its reward system. He spoke to party supporters soon after receiving members of the Abiodun Aluko-led APC registration team, in his country home, Abraka community, Ethiope East Local Government Area, on Thursday. Ogboru said, “I know as a party, we have not been too fair to ourselves especially in the reward system, and that is why the leadership of the party has decided to embark on this exercise.  And it is on the strength of that commitment that am revalidating my membership. “Mr. President has even said that the party we all belong to must go back to the people and that gone are the days when decisions are made in Abuja by one person.  It is time the people decide who becomes their leaders”. The APC leader also expressed confidence that with the enthusiasm of the people of that state have shown in the APC registration exercise, the party will become the party to beat come 2023.
