THE National Chairman of the Action Alliance, Mr. Adekunle Omoaje, has said his re-election for a second term at the party’s national convention in Osogbo last week confirms him as the authentic chairman of the party. He said any other person claiming to be the national chairman of the party was an impostor. Omoaje spoke through a statement in Osogbo on Monday. The statement read in part, “The National Think Tank Committee of the Action Alliance had long before now expelled Udeze and his cohorts for anti-party activities. His expulsion was in line with the constitution of the party and this has not been lifted by the party or any court of law. “The NTTC is the highest decision ruling organ of our party and at no time did NTTC meet to lift the expulsion of Udeze. He is not a member of the party let alone being an official. His purported election is without photo, video or INEC representative.” He urged members of the public, especially political groups to disregard any action taken by Udeze in the capacity of the National Chairman of AA.
