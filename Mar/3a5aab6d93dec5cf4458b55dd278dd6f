They were on social media sending so many encouraging videos.”  Answering a question on the Dangote Refinery, the largest single-train refinery in the world, she said, “I wish we had done it years ago. If we had done it years ago and encouraged Alhaji Dangote, who is doing a good thing, we’d be producing our own fuel today.” Some of the issues she discussed with President Buhari include improving Nigeria’s share of global trade, developing Nigeria’s services sector, Covid-19, attracting investment, training and capacity building, and safe schools.
