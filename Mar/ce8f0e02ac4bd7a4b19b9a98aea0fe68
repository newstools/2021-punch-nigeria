Sunday Aborisade, Abuja THE National Assembly has expressed its readiness to amend the Constitution to ensure gender parity and enact laws to improve the fortunes of women and girls in Nigeria. This was just as the Senate resolved to expunge provisions of the law as contained in the Police Act, Federal Character Law, Electoral Act, Labour Act and Political Parties constitutions, which infringed on the rights of women in Nigeria. The decision was conveyed amidst resolutions reached on Wednesday during plenary when the Upper Chamber considered a motion on the 2021 International Women’s Day Celebration with the theme: “Women in Leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-l9 world #Choose To Challenge”. The motion was sponsored by Senator Betty Apiafi (PDP, Rivers West); and co-sponsored by Senators Aisha Dahiru Ahmed (Adamawa Central); Oluremi Tinubu (Lagos Central); Biodun Olujimi (Ekiti South); Akon Eyakenyi (Akwa Ibom South); Stella Oduah (Anambra North); Uche Lillian Ekwunife (Anambra South); and Chimaroke Nnamani (Enugu East). Coming under Order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, Apiafi noted that the International Women’s Day celebrated on the 8th of March, every year, “is a day set aside globally to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.” She said, “Gender parity is a statistical measure that compares women and men through their income, education, and work hours among other points. It is also an important tool for policymakers striving towards gender equality.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
