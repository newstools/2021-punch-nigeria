Joseph Olaoluwa E-hailing drivers under the National Union of Professional App-based Workers have faulted the launch of Lagos Ride, a ride-hailing service in Lagos, Nigeria. Lagos Ride is a new e-hailing taxi scheme to redefine road transportation in the state, according to the government. The state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, last week signed a partnership agreement with CIG Motors Company Limited for the take-off of the Lagos Ride scheme with a pilot fleet of 1,000 units of brand new Sport Utility Vehicles. National President of NUPABW, Ibrahim Ayoade, who expressed his displeasure with the launch in a telephone interview with our correspondent said he did not expect competition from the government. He said, “We did not expect that the government will go into the business. We expect the government to focus on regulation. “This is what we have been fighting all this while. The other side we looked at is the assembling of the cars. The assembling of the cars is an opportunity but the government doing the business is not something we are clear with. The government has not done the right thing.” Ayoade added, “There is an e-hailing drivers’ association on ground. They are meant to consult us so we can advise them on the right things to do. “These are the challenges that we are not clear about and we need more clarification on how to go about it.” Ayoade sought more clarification over the commencement of the new initiative. He asked the government to continually have them in mind as it introduced something that concerns e-hailing business. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
