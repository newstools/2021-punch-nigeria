Daniel Igoni, Yenagoa The immediate past governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has explained why he distanced himself from the administration of Governor Douye Diri. His explanation came amidst speculations that all was not well between him and Diri. In a statement he personally signed on Thursday, Dickson, who represents Bayelsa West in the Senate, stated that it was his decision before exiting office to give whoever succeeded him the freedom to govern. He said, “No one has a greater stake in the governor’s success than me. I am aware of the concerns raised about the distance I have kept since leaving office. This is deliberate and in consonance with my values and principles. “While I was governor I took a conscious decision that whoever was going to succeed me was going to have the free hand to run his government with my full support. I am not one of those who believe that a governor should be remote-controlled. “A governor should be free to take actions and decisions to pursue programmes, projects and policies he believes in. A governor must be in charge and I have always encouraged Governor Diri to take charge and to also take responsibility at all time. “In the process, where he deems it, he can consult stakeholders for their inputs and advice and that the governor does with me and others. This is why we did not enter into any agreement nor give the governor any condition for my and our full and total support other than to do his best for the state and the Ijaw nation and in doing so, he has our continuous support.” Copyright PUNCH.
