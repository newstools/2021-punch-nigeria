Temiloluwa O’Peters The Chief Executive Officer of 9mobile, Alan Sinfield, has affirmed the company’s support for the ‘Smart City’ initiative of the Lagos State Government. Speaking at a panel session on ‘Digital Transformation Solutions for Smart Cities’, Sinfield noted the significance of the Smart City master plan of Lagos State and how 9mobile would facilitate its realization, according to a statement from the company. He said, “At 9mobile, we have plans to further support an environment that enables creativity and visions to be realized by using our resources to build ICT development areas and sandboxes for entrepreneurs to develop their ideas for the future.” Sinfield added that an additional critical element would be the service management element, noting that nothing ever worked well or was sustainable without the necessary support teams to maintain and keep things working. “There is a real need to focus on developing the skills and support framework and not just the appealing artificial intelligence/machine learning and technology aspects,” he said. The CEO further noted that digital and tech hubs were crucial for building talent and highlighted the importance of big data and data mining as the lifeline of a smart city. Sinfield commended the Lagos State Government for sustaining the Ehingbeti Summit over the years while highlighting its economic impacts. Also speaking, the West Africa Consulting Leader, Deloitte, Yemi Saka noted that there must be an investment in human and social capital key to actualizing a smart city ecosystem. Copyright PUNCH.
