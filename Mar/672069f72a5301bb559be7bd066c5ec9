Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Students of the Nigeria Maritime University, Okerenkoko, Kurutie Campus, in Delta State on Monday embarked on a peaceful protest over the death of one of their colleagues, Emmanuel Oyi, a 100-level student of the Civil Engineering Department. As the situation became tense, the protesters forcefully shut down the university gate. The deceased student was said to have died on Sunday evening due to the alleged poor healthcare facility in the institution. Witnesses said the student community mobilised for the showdown by Monday afternoon when news broke that the deceased allegedly died of suspected expired drugs. Consequently, they marched around the campus with placards, singing anti-management slogans in condemnation of the development. The management of the University could not be reached for comments as of the time of filing this report. Only last week Thursday, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State hailed the take-off of the Maritime University in Okerenkoko, saying it had brought peace to the Niger Delta. While pledging support of the State Government to the growth and development of the University, the governor also assured that the administration would partner Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency to develop the stateâ€™s maritime potential. Governor Okowa made the assertions while hosting the Director-General of NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh, and his management team who visited him at the Government House, Asaba. The Governor commended the management of the agency for reaching out to stakeholders in the littoral states in its determination to develop the maritime sector.
