Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The continued suspension of international flights to and from the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, is denying the Federal Government a lot of revenue, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said on Tuesday. Sirika said this in his office in Abuja when he received a delegation from Kano State led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. The minister told his guests that it was the desire of his ministry to reopen the airport for international flight operations, as it made no economic sense for government to spend so much on the facility and decide to leave it inoperative. He, however, stated that the decision to suspend international flights to and from the airport, like the ones in Enugu and Port Harcourt, were for health and security reasons. Sirika in a statement issued by his ministryâ€™s spokesperson, James Odaudu, promised that all that was necessary for the resumption of international flight operations at the airport would be fast-tracked to ensure that it resumes sooner than later. He challenged Kano indigenes to create activities that would make the airport more viable through increased passenger traffic. In his address, Ganduje said he was in the ministry to appreciate the Federal Government for the completion of the international wing of the airport and to appeal for the resumption of international flight operations at the facility. The governor expressed concern over the effect of the continued suspension of international flights to and from the airport by passengers and service providers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
