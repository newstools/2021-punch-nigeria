Suspected herdsmen, on Monday, reportedly kidnapped five persons in the Ayamelum Local Government Area of Anambra State. One of the victims, Francis Onwuachu, is the President-General of Omor community. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Haruna, confirmed the incident. He said he was not aware of the number of victims as of press time, adding that the report he got was that the president-general of the community was kidnapped. Haruna said the command had commenced investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. He said until investigation was concluded to ascertain what led to the incident and those behind it, he would not be able to say if the abductors were locals or Fulani herdsmen. A former Chairman of the local government area, Udoji Amedu, said Onwuachu’s car had been recovered by the police. He stated, “Apart from the PG, we heard that four other persons were kidnapped by the herdsmen. “The abductors have established contact with us and they are demanding N10m as ransom to release only the PG. Nothing has been heard about the other victims for now.” Amedu lamented that his cousin was killed last month by herdsmen. He said many people had been killed and scores of women raped in the past few months by suspected herdsmen in the area. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
