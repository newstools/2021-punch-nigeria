Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt A former Acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Victor Giadom, on Monday, threatened to sue the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission if it includes the APC logo on the ballot for the Local Government Council elections, scheduled for April 17. He issued the threat after revalidating his APC membership, in his ward 16, in Bera community, Gokana Local Government Area. Giadom said, “Let me reaffirm and say it clearly here that the APC will not participate in the local government election in Rivers State. I am talking about the one purported for April, because we know that that election will not bring justice to anybody. “There will be no fair opportunity for people to contest that election. So, we are not participating. We are going to write RSIEC and for any reason, if RSIEC attempts to put our (APC) on that ballot, we will charge them to court and claim damages because we are not participating in that election.” Also speaking at the event, Nigeria’s former ambassador to the Netherlands, Chief Oji Ngofa while calling for healing and reconciliation in the party said, “Like I said, reconciliation is easier now because they are coming from a position of weakness. So, they cannot be making demands on the party. So, it is easy for us in a very open and genuine manner to welcome them back.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
