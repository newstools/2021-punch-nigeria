Nnamdi-Otto further said he knew his rival, whom he described as a crook, and that the court was condoning him. Not done, the chief walked out of the witness box, hit his palm on the floor and threatened to deal with the judge and his rival, as well as to petition the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and an unnamed minister. The presiding judge, Justice Aldolphus Enebele, after watching the drama for a while, ordered that Nnamdi-Otto be put back in the witness box and should show cause why he should not be committed to prison for contempt.
