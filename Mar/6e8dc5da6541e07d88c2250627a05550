Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives Committee on Judiciary has mourned a Justice of the Supreme Court, Sylvester Ngwuta, who died in the early hours of Sunday.

The statement read, “With heavy heart, we received the news of the passing of Honourable Justice Nwali Sylvester Ngwuta, Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, who passed away in the early hours of Sunday, March 7, 2021. “Justice Ngwuta was an intellectual and a legal icon whose legacies and influence straddled different legal circles and ecosystems. His track record bespeaks a man of hard work, discipline and commitment. “Starting out as a Judge of the High Court of Abia Region in October 1995, My Lord rose to become the Justice of the Court of Appeal in 2003 and was later sworn in as a Justice of the Supreme Court in 2011. My Lord also served in different other capacities including judicial panels and election tribunals. “Justice Ngwuta contributed immensely to the development, growth and expansion of Nigeria’s legal system and jurisprudence. His presence was felt in the legal firmament especially in the areas of electoral, civil and criminal laws. His industry and service to the judiciary and Nigeria will sorely be missed. “May his gentle soul rest in peace. Adieu, great jurist.” Ngwuta reportedly died in his sleep at his official residence in Abuja at almost the age of 70. The late JSC was said to be getting set for his retirement from the Supreme Court on March 30, 2021, upon attainment of 70 years mandatory retirement age. Justice Ngwuta was born in 1951 in Amofia-Ukawu, Onicha Local government Ebonyi.
