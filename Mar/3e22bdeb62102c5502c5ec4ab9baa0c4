Three hundred students of Chrisland University, Abeokuta, Ogun State, matriculated at a virtual ceremony to kick-start the 2020/2021 academic session. The students, who were sworn in on the university campus, were admitted into three colleges – College of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Natural and Applied Sciences, and College of Arts, Social and Management Sciences. Speaking at the sixth matriculation ceremony, the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Chinedum Babalola, urged the newly admitted students to abide by the rules and regulations of the institution and participate in all activities of the university. Babalola said the university had zero tolerance for cultism, hooliganism and corruption, adding that it would therefore spare no student caught on the wrong side of the law. She advised the students to show respect to colleagues and staff in the university to make them stay fruitful and productive. The guest speaker of the occasion, Prof. Kayode Adeoye, stressed the importance of education, saying the students should forego “certain junk” that would not lead to quality education. Adeoye added that policymakers needed to review the syllabus of all schools from primary schools to higher institutions so that they could start producing students as professionals
