The Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed June 10 to rule on the no-case submission filed by the immediate-past President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr Paul Usoro (SAN), in response to the money laundering charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The EFCC accused Usoro of laundering N1.4bn belonging to Akwa Ibom State, where he hails from. He was charged with 10 counts, which was later reduced to six after the Court of Appeal struck out four of the charges which featured the name of Akwa Ibom State Government, Udom Emmanuel, whom EFCC claimed connived with Usoro to allegedly launder the N1.4bn. Usoro had pleaded not guilty to the charges after which the EFCC called two witnesses and tendered some documents to prove the charges. At the close of the prosecutionâ€™s case, Usoro, rather than enter his defence, filed a no-case submission, through his legal team, headed by Chief Effiong Effiong. He contended that the EFCC failed to establish a prima facie case against him to warrant him to put in any defence. He urged Justice Rilwan Aikawa to strike out the charges against him and set him free. But the EFCC opposed the no-case submission, insisting that it had established a prima facie case against Usoro. Justice Aikawa fixed June 10 for ruling. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
