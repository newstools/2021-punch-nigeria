Samson Folarin The Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, on Wednesday broke his silence on the loss he suffered during the #EndSARS protest in the state, saying hoodlums stole $2m and N17m from his palace at Iga Idugaran, Lagos Island. Akiolu noted that many buildings were destroyed and vehicles vandalised in the state after hoodlums hijacked the protest on October 21, 2020. The monarch spoke during the inauguration of the remodeled Glover Hall Memorial, Lagos Island, Lagos State. Viral videos circulated online showed hoodlums breaking into the palace and stealing different items and artefacts, including the monarch’s staff of office. Akiolu said Lagos suffered more than other states in the country during the protest and urged the Federal Government to assist the state to recover its losses. He said, “I will support anything that will move Lagos forward. I have appealed to the Federal Government to assist Lagos with what we have suffered. The incident that happened here from October 20th to 23rd is so saddening. “The destruction we suffered in Lagos is so enormous than in any other part of the country. Many buildings were burnt, including vehicles used to generate income. I can now say publicly that they stole $2m and N17m from my palace. “Those who committed the offence would not have done that if they knew the implication. But as a father, I won’t place any curse on them.” The state Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the remodelling of Glover Memorial Hall reflected the determination of his administration to rebuild Lagos as well as promote the entertainment and tourism sector.
