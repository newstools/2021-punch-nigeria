Sovereign Trust Insurance Plc said as part of plans to make the brand a household name nationally, the management had set up machinery for establishing branches in all the major commercial cities in the country. A statement on Friday titled ‘Sovereign Trust Insurance Plc…committed to brand development in the insurance industry in Nigeria’. To date, it stated, the company has presence in Lagos with three area offices in Apapa, Ikeja, Lagos Central and an agency office in Lekki. The underwriting firm said it has significantly remained focused on building an enduring brand in the face of various adversities as it continued to compete in the insurance industry in Nigeria. One very critical area the company has placed much emphasis on was in developing a versatile and well-qualified workforce, it stated. As a transiting organisation conscious of its brand equity, the company stated that it has a well-entrenched culture of upholding sound moral and professional ethics beyond profit. From inception, it added, it had significantly shown upward progression in every area of its operations, making it one of the fastest growing and upwardly mobile insurance companies in the country. As a brand, the organisation has in the last couple of years recorded remarkable successes in corporate social responsibility initiatives and top-notch events in the country, it stated.
