Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Suspected ritualists have killed a man and woman in Amanze and Amainyi communities in the Ihitte/Uboma Local Government Area of Imo State. The incidents, our correspondent learnt, had caused panic in the communities as many residents fled the area. The decomposing bodies of the victims were discovered inside a big sack by a bush path in the area. The communities, an indigene told our correspondent, were border areas between the Ihitte Uboma and Obowo local government areas of the state. A source said, “The bodies of the unknown victims were discovered by villagers going to farm on Saturday following an offensive smell that emanated from the bush path where they were dumped. “Some of the vital organs of the victims such as their eyes, breasts and other private parts were missing and the hair on the woman’s head was shaved off. “The decomposing bodies could not be easily identified as their skin layers were already peeling off. Also, their genitals and eyes were harvested, making it difficult to identify the victims.” Our correspondent learnt that there were no reported cases of missing persons before the decomposing bodies were found. When contacted, the police spokesman in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, said he had not been informed of the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
