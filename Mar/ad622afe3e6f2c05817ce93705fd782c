A former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has asked Governor Hope Uzodinma to stop inaugurating the projects he already when he was governor. Okorocha, in a statement by his spokesperson, Sam Onwuemeodo, on Saturday, said it was embarrassing and worrisome for Uzodinma to be claiming and inaugurating his projects, urging the governor to build his own projects. The statement read, “We appeal to His Excellency, Governor Hope Uzodinma to stop claiming and inaugurating projects Senator Rochas Okorocha did when he governed the state from May 29, 2011 to May 28, 2019. “It is not only embarrassing to the governor, his government and indeed the people of the state, but worrisome for the government to be claiming or taking the credit for the projects done by any of the governors before him, especially by Okorocha. “It doesn’t speak well of the incumbent government.” He said they might be tempted to let the world know that the incumbent government had been claiming Okorocha’s projects. When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to Uzodinma on Print Media, Modestus Nwamkpa, urged Okorocha to stop provoking the people of the state. He said the governor had in one year in office surpassed the achievements of Okorocha in eight years. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
