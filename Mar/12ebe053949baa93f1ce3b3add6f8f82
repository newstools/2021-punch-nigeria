The Lagos State Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has said the state government would continue to consult its former senior employees on government polices, adding that their experiences matter. Muri-Okunola stated this at the seventh annual general meeting and inauguration of the executive committee of the Association of Lagos State Retired Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries on Thursday at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium in Alausa, Ikeja. The HoS, who noted that the state could not govern the state alone, urged the retired senior employees to partner the government. He said, “Engagement of stakeholders in determining government activities is paramount to us in Lagos. One of the important stakeholders is our senior citizens, especially those who passed through the annals of our public service. “The initiative behind establishing ALARHOSPS is that government cannot do it alone and all hand must be on deck. I urge them to continue to partner Lagos. We rely on them, their advice and guidance in policy formulations and service delivery to the people of Lagos. Their knowledge is measureless; their time-tested experiences gathered over the years to deliver quality public service that we are benefiting from. “The positive impact of ALARHOSPS over the years is appreciated. Our expectations should not be less, given the calibre of its membership and leadership.” The new President of the association, Femi Olugbile, promised to build on the success of his predecessor to take the association to higher heights.
