The Lagos State Government on Saturday and Sunday sealed 11 facilities, including Event Centres, Lounges and Night Clubs among others for contravening COVID-19 directives. The Director-General of the Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr Lanre Mojola, made this disclosure after the sealing exercise in Lagos on Sunday. Mojola said though the affected event centers originally informed the agency of their intention to organise parties and events, they failed to meet the expectations of the agency on complying with COVID-19 protocols.

He said that those facilities were sealed for non-compliance with COVID -19 Health Protection Regulations of the State and Federal Government. Mojola, who was represented at the sealing of the property by Dr Wale Adeboje, the Events Safety Administrator of LSC, maintained that the enforcement exercise saw event centres, bars and lounge sealed between Saturday and Sunday.
