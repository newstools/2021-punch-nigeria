Temiloluwa O’Peters The National Identity Management Commission has issued a disclaimer against National Identification Number verification website, https://nin-5gb-offer.online. NIMC on Friday warned the general public that the website, which claimed to verify numbers chosen to receive 5GB as part of a NIN verification reward programme was not associated with the commission. The commission noted that it was run by fraudsters and advised members of the public to protect their personal information. The disclaimer said, “This website/platform is not associated with NIMC; it is run by fraudsters. Protect your personal information; do not become a victim!” NIMC also notified the public on its website that NIN enrolment and NIN were free, adding that persons should beware of fake and unauthorised apps collecting NINs.
