Joseph Olaoluwa The Lagos State Government has announced the partial closure of the Marine Bridge for three months for emergency repair works on the Apapa outward section of the bridge. The closure date is expected to last from Tuesday, March 9 to Monday, June 21, 2021, according to a statement titled ‘LASG to close Marine Bridge for emergency repairs’. The statement signed by the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde was released on Friday. Oladeinde stated that the partial closure was necessary to maintain the bridge infrastructure. The maintenance work includes removal and cleaning of the existing expansion joints to prevent further deterioration. The commissioner explained that during the period of the partial closure, traffic would be diverted to alternative routes, while Apapa inward lane would be divided into two lanes to allow counter flow of traffic. To ameliorate the effect of the expected traffic, palliative works had been completed on alternative routes to ease movement, the statement said. Motorists inwards Apapa were advised to make use of Total underneath the bridge to connect Naval Dockyard to Danlami to Leventis corridor and/or to connect Marine Beach by Mobil through Federal Fire Service/Obanikoro to Naggaf/North Avenue to Wharf Road. Similarly, motorists from Ajegunle inwards Iganmu/or Ijora were directed to use Agbo Malu to Tego Barracks to Total underneath the bridge and ascend Marine bridge to connect their desired destinations.
