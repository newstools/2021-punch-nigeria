Matthew Ochei Low voter turnout and late arrival of electoral materials marred the conduct of Delta State local government election on Saturday. Our correspondent observed late arrival of materials at the various wards and polling units visited without the use of smart card reader while security personnel were at their duty post. At Uzoigwe DSIEC wards 11 and 20, in Oshimili South, and Ward 9 Okpanam in Oshimili North materials had yet to arrive at 9:30am. At DSIEC ward 3, 4 and 16 in Illah community, there were tensions at the polling units, as supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressive Congress allegedly clashed over the late arrival of materials. Speaking on the development, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Olise Ifeajika, said the late arrival of materials was the fault of DSIEC. He said, “There are basically two major political parties here, PDP and APC. Some APC supporters are making trouble, but, in all, I am impressed by the way the election is going on.” Copyright PUNCH.
