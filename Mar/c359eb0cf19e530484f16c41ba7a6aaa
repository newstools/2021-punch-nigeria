Dayo Ojerinde A six-year-old girl, Anuoluwapo Moses, has appealed to members of the public to assist her with funds that will enable her to go for surgery. Anuoluwapo who was diagnosed with congenital heart disease on December 11, 2019, would need N15m to travel abroad for the procedure. A letter from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, revealed that Anuoluwapo had been a patient of the paediatric cardiology unit. The letter with the title, ‘To Whom It May Concern,’ was dated February 10, 2020, and was signed by a consultant paediatrician, O.J Sokunbi. The letter partly reads, “Clinical evaluation indicated that Anuoluwapo has symptomatic congenital heart disease which was confirmed by echocardiography to be Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia ad hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. “She will require a further cardiovascular evaluation and possible open heart surgery to correct her heart defects in order to forestall irreversible and life-threatening complications.” Also, another letter sighted by our correspondent showed that a hospital in India, Indraprastha Apollos hospital, had accepted to perform the surgery required to correct Anuoluwapo’s heart condition. Members of the public can reach out to Anuoluwapo’s father, Moses on his mobile number, 0802 457 6529, while donations can be made into her First Bank account; account name, Moses Anuoluwapo; account number; 3172321375.
