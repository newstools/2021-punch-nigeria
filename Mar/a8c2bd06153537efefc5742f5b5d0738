Jos Electricity Distribution Company says 19,317 households in Gombe State have so far been metered. The Head of Corporate Communications, JEDC, Dr Adakole Elijah, told the News Agency of Nigeria that efforts were ongoing to meter more households, in line with the directive of the Federal Government, while expressing the JEDC’s desire to end estimated billing of customers. He stated that JEDC’s effort at metering customers in Gombe State was strengthened by the National Mass Metering Programme, which had brought great relief for both staff and customers of the company. Elijah noted that, in February, a total of 1,538 households were metered under the Mass Metering Scheme. He said though the company had 89,077 customers in the state, it was making strenuous efforts to meter all those yet to be reached. He, however, lamented the recurring cases of vandalism as a major challenge for JEDC during its day-to-day operations. “On Tuesday morning, through a tip-off from a concerned customer, some vandals were apprehended and handed over to security operatives for further investigations,” he said. The JEDC spokesman noted that 38 incidents of vandalism were recorded in 2020, involving mostly incidents of transformer oil and transformer cables. Elijah commended the law enforcement agencies for their efforts at curbing the menace in the state, while urging members of the public to be on alert and report suspected activities of vandals. According to him, aside from vandalism and other acts of economic sabotage, the huge outstanding bills yet to be paid by customers in the state is another challenge faced by the company. He said, in order to address the challenge, the company had adopted metering of highly indebted customers to avoid further accumulation of debts, stressing that the company was owed N2.2bn in 2020 by its various customers, including the state government.
