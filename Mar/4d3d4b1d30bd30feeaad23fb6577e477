Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt THE Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Plc has blamed the blackout being experienced in some communities in Rivers and Bayelsa States to activities of youths who forced the shutting down of transmission stations within the areas under its coverage. It was learnt that the aggrieved youths from the host community to the transmission station in Ahoada East Local Government Area of Rivers State carried out the action on Tuesday. Our correspondent also gathered that the youths from Ahoada were demanding for a 24-hour power supply from the distribution firm, saying in the past, they were enjoying more hours of electricity and wondered what had changed. But PHED in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Chioma Aninwe, noted that the action of the community was responsible for the power outage in the two states. The statement reads, “Please, be informed that the outage being experienced in some parts of Rivers and Bayesla states is as a result of unlawful barricade of Ahoada Transmission Station by some community youths who coerced the operators to shut down both Ahoada and Yenagoa transmission stations. “Areas affected are Yenegoa (Bayelsa State) Ikwerre LGA, Abua/Odua, Ahoada East and West, Emohua, Degema amongst others. Power supply will be restored as soon as this issue is resolved.” She urged the affected areas to bear with PHEDC as the firm engaged the community leaders for an amicable solution to the unfortunate incident.
