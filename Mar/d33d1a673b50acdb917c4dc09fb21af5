Dayo Ojerinde the Lagos State Government on Tuesday said it would continue to prioritise its extension officers to ensure they were able to help farmers to increase their yields. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, said this while declaring open a five-day training for extension workers. According to a statement on Tuesday, the training was an initiative of the Lagos State Agricultural Development Authority and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Olusanya said, “I see the extension agents as teachers of farmers, meaning we have to do more on encouraging and motivating them to ensure that they are able to help our farmers in terms of increasing yields and enhance productivity, and that we have a more food secured Nigeria and more food secured Lagos. “During the lockdown, so much focus was put on teachers by the government to ensure that they do not suffer as schools were shut down and income was not coming in. “But our farmers and our farming communities suffered huge losses; meaning that the impact of the lockdown would have been worse on extension agents and officers. Who thought about that? It is about time that we begin to move with one voice and begin to show ourselves more in the light that we want to be seen. That narrative needs to change going forward.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
