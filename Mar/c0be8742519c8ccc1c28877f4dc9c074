Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has asked the Governor of Enugu State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, to drop a proposed bill aiming to provide life pension for former governors and their deputies. SERAP said the bill also made provision for medical allowance not exceeding N12m per annum for one surviving spouse, provided that such spouse was married to the governor while in office. The rights group, in a statement on Monday, threatened legal action against Ugwuanyi if the bill is passed into law.

The bill also made provision for medical allowance not exceeding N12m per annum for one surviving spouse, provided that such spouse was married to the governor while in office. “While the state government would provide adequate security for the former governors for their lifetime, the bill would also mandate the state government to provide three vehicles for the ex-governor and replace them every four years.” READ ALSO: Asari-Dokubo declares self new Biafran body’s leader, names officials
