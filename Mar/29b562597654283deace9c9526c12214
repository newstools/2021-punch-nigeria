The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, on Sunday said the ongoing war against Boko Haram would soon be over. Attahiru, who was on a visit to the troops of Sector 2 Operation Lafiya Dole of the Nigerian Army in Damaturu, Yobe State, assured the soldiers that Boko Haram would soon be defeated. The COAS, while addressing the troops, said, “We have come to Yobe State to the sector headquarters to meet you, to get to know you and you get to know us as well. We promise ending this issue of Boko Haram. “I will like to tell you that I personally, as the Chief of Army Staff, I am here to take cognizance and note of the challenges you have and ensure that they are addressed to ensure you have the highest level of morale to be able to do your job and do it proudly as Nigerian soldiers.” The COAS said he was impressed with the performance of the soldiers. “I am very pleased, your commanders have told me what you have done collectively as part of Operation Tura Takai Bango, and how you pushed the Boko Haram insurgents. We are proud of you and I believe in the second phase of that operation, you will do more,” he added. He also appealed to the people of Yobe State to continue supporting and cooperating with the security operatives in their fight against the insurgents. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
