Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate Committee on Finance on Wednesday summoned the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, to appear before it over alleged inadequate remittances to the Single Treasury Account. The Chairman of the Senate panel, Senator Solomon Adeola, disclosed this while addressing journalists on his committee’s planned investigation into the alleged poor remittances of the ministries, departments and agencies of government to the TSA. Adeola said there was no record that the accountant-general had carried out a comprehensive reconciliation of the TSA since its full implementation in 2015. He said, “I want you to put it on record that since the inception of the Single Treasury Account was set up, there has not been any reconciliation done in this regard. “I believe if we are going to be crucifying, bringing the revenue generating agencies to book concerning how much was generated, how much was expended, it is only good that the agency that received the money, should answer questions. “The Central Bank of Nigeria is receiving the funds on behalf of the revenue generation agencies, and the Accountant-General of the Federation is saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that the revenue goes into the bank.” The senator said government should check leakages to prevent reoccurring yearly government deficit.
