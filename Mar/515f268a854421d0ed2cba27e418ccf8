Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate on Wednesday asked the Federal Ministry of Works and the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency to immediately put in motion, machinery to temporarily rehabilitate the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta expressway, pending its total reconstruction to reduce the hardship and suffering of Nigerians. The red chamber also asked the ministry to include further funding for the reconstruction of the Express Road in the next Appropriation Bill. The resolution was sequel to a motion sponsored by Senator Solomon Adeola and seven others during plenary. Moving the motion, Adeola said the vast stretches of the once motorable and ultra-busy Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta Express Road had totally collapsed without any sign or signal for palliative repairs, rehabilitation or reconstruction from agencies charged with road maintenance. He said that if no immediate remedial measure was put in place pending total reconstruction, the industries along the axis would be completely cut off from accessing raw materials from Lagos seaports. Senator Tolulope Odebiyi said priority must be accorded the road because of the industries on that axis. He urged the Senate to use its legislative instruments to find funding for the rehabilitation of the road. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
