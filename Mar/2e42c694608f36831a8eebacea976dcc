Ada Wodu, Calabar A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Cross River State, Chief Higgins Peters, has said the capacity of a candidate to govern should be given priority over zoning in the choice of Governor Ben Ayede’s successor. He also said the Northern Senatorial Zone would decide where the governorship position will go among the three zones in 2023. Party leaders in the Southern Senatorial Zone had insisted that it was the turn of the south. Peters, in an interview with journalists, in Calabar, on Saturday, said, “In democracy, there is no zoning. Was there any time the three zones did not contest the governorship ticket against one another? “In 2023 the Northern Senatorial Zone would decide where the governor comes from because we have the highest voting population among the three zones, and the incumbency factor. The incumbent Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, is from that zone and he would have a say about who succeeds him. “Any Cross Riverian that has capacity should be governor. I believe in politics of capacity, what you have to offer.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
