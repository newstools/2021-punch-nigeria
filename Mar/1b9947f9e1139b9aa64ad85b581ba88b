Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Senate and the House of Representatives are on a collision course over concurrence with bills. At the plenary on Wednesday, the Majority Leader of the House, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, had lamented that the Senate had allegedly not been reciprocating the House’ timely consideration and concurrence with bills passed by the other chamber. Ado-Doguwa made the allegation when he presented some bills from the Senate for concurrence by the House. In a record time, the House had on March 24, 2020, passed an Emergency Economic Stimulus Bill 2020, which mainly sought to provide a short-term relief to companies and individuals from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Senate has yet to consider the bill almost one year after. On Wednesday, the Majority Leader noted that there were many bills passed by the House and transmitted to the Senate, which had not been considered for concurrence as provided by law. He said, “I want to put on record that this House takes seriously the issue of working together with the Senate for maximum performance. That is why this House has always given speedy consideration to bills passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same thing about the Senate. “We have quite a number of bills passed by this House which are still lying on the table of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Business unattended to. This is a thing of concern to the leadership of this House.” Ado-Doguwa pointed out that there was the need for the two chambers to work closely and streamline their activities as components of a bicameral legislature.
