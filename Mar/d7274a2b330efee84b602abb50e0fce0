Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The cold war at the Imo State House of Assembly, Owerri, on Thursday, took another dimension as the lawmakers impeached their majority leader, Uche Ogbuagu. Ogbuagu, who represents Ikeduru state constituency, had defected to the All Progressives Congress from Peoples Democratic Party shortly after Emeka Ihedioha was removed in January 2020 by the Supreme Court as governor in order to emerge a principal officer of the house. At Thursdayâ€™s plenary which was held under tight security, Ogbuagu was removed by a majority vote. The speaker, Paul Emezim, who was presiding over the plenary announced that the majority leader of the house had been impeached. The PUNCH gathered that the impeached majority leader had been having cold war with deputy speaker, Amarachi Iwuanyanwu.
