Patrick Odey, Uyo The management of Akwa Ibom State airline says Ibom Air has airlifted a total of 500,000 passengers since it commenced operations on June 7, 2019. The Chief Operating Officer of the airline, George Ureisi, said this in a statement issued by the Group Manager, Marketing and Communications, Annie Esseinette, on Monday. Essienette quoted Ureisi as saying that the feat was an ‘indication of steady customer uptake and validation of services’. The statement said, “We are very pleased to record this key milestone of 500,000 passengers. Although we would have clocked this number around November of last year but for the three and a half months Covid-19 lockdown; still, it is an indication of steady customer uptake and validation of our services.” He added that the airline had consistently maintained above 90 per cent performance since inception.
