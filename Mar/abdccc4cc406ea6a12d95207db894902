John Charles, Makurdi BENUE State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said his decision to reconcile with his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed was taken in the interest of the Peoples Democratic Party and Nigeria. Ortom said this while speaking to reporters at the Makurdi Airport, on Wednesday. He spoke on his return from Rivers State where he had gone to honour an invitation by the state Governor, Nyesom Wike, who also mediated in feud between the two state governors. The Benue State governor said, “We decided to sheath our swords and find better ways to communicate with each other and I think that was our take home. “And so, we are to focus on the deteriorating security in the country. We need to partner with the Federal Government as governors we need to work as a team to ensure that we restore security for our people. “As at today, you can see that the entire security architecture has completely collapsed and there is a need to leave parties and ethnicity aside and work to ensure that all hands are on deck and provide security for our people because without security, there can be any meaningful development. “So, whatever it will take to make sacrifices to bring down our egos and allow peace to reign. And we call on all Nigerians, the Presidency, all governors and chairmen to work together to achieve this.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
