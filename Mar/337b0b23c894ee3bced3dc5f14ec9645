A non-Governmental organization, Living Home Ventures, has launched an online family forum called Familylifers.com, aimed at empowering young people and families. Speaking at the launch, the founders, Bisi and Yomi Adewale explained that Family lifers was a multifaceted platform that provided an opportunity for empowerment, employment, acquisition of skills, advertisement of businesses for SMEs/entrepreneurs, among others. They said it was created to help the Nigerian youth engage in meaningful ventures and ultimately help in nation building. According to Yomi Adewale, the COVID-19 pandemic brought about increased challenges faced by families, especially the youths with unemployment. She said it was on this premise that the initiative of creating an online platform was built to address structural and practical challenges faced by our youth today. “It’s a laudable idea as this will collaborate and support the efforts of the government to curb the rate of unemployment among our youths,” Adewale said. Also Bisi Adewale commented that the platform would help in wealth creation by providing an avenue for unemployed graduates to be linked with employers of labour as they upload their CVs on the platform. He said, “The new platform will also give room for young Nigerians to interact and showcase their skills, products and services free of charge.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
