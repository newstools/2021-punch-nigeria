Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia THE Abia State chapter of All Progressive Congress, has debunked provocative comments allegedly made against the person of former Senate President, Ken Nnamani by Prince B. B. Apugo. Apugo, was quoted to have berated Ken Nnamani for being a poor representative of the APC in the Southeast region. However, the state APC Chairman, Chief Donatus Nwankpa, at a media briefing in Umuahia, on Wednesday said the media report was false and that the relationship between the party, Apugo and Nnamani was cordial. Nwankpa wondered where the story about a frosty relationship between the two-party chieftains came from. He said, “I won’t even say they (reporters) were mischievous. I can only say that they are being theoretical and that they were fictitious.” The party chairman described Apugo as “our father who is cultured, the Prince and the custodian of the Ibeku culture and who cannot go outside to start fighting a man.” He also dismissed speculations that a member of the House of Representatives, Nkeiru Onyejeocha slapped Sen. Ken Nnamani. Nwankpa described the on-going APC membership registration and revalidation exercise in the state and the entire south east as a huge success. “Abia and south-easterners are cueing into the national grid. We have got one of the best, Gen Ihejirika, who has, after serving as the Chief of Army Staff, is yet to be faulted.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
