Sodiq Oyeleke The National Coordinator of the Oodua Peoples Congress, Gani Adams, has urged the police to fish out the killers of four men at Idiyan village, Igangan, Oyo State. The Oyo State Police Command confirmed that the four men were killed early Monday morning. This is coming barely 24 hours after members of OPC arrested a Fulani warlord, Iskilu Wakili, in the area. Adams, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, said the four men were killed in the “most gruesome manner”. “Wakili men have displaced more than a million residents in the over 10 villages in Oke Ogun. They have raped, and killed residents at will. They have been terrorising our people for more than six years. “It is sad that Kidnapping and killing still continue unabated without any clue as to the time it will end. Today, four men were hacked to death at Idiyan village, and it is sad and most unfortunate that the police have not been able to unravel the killers till the present time.” Adams, however, urged the police to release the OPC members, and concentrate on getting Igangan forests rid of bandits and kidnappers. Meanwhile, the Oyo Police Command on Monday confirmed the killing of four men in the Oke-Ogun area. Spokesperson of the Command, Olugbenga Fadeyi, a Chief Superintendent, said the police quickly moved to the scene to remove the corpse. He added the corpses were later deposited at Fadok Hospital morgue for autopsy. Fadeyi in a terse statement said, “It was reliably gathered that unknown gunmen attacked and killed four men at Kokobido village Idiko Ile via Ijio at about 0300 hrs of today 8/3/21. “The DPO Ijio quickly moved into the scene and removed corpses to Fadok Hospital morgue for autopsy. “Efforts intensified to arrest the perpetrators of the crime.”
