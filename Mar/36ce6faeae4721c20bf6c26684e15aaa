The Accident Investigation Bureau has transferred the investigation of the incident involving Air Peace’s B737-300 aircraft with nationality and registration Marks 5N-BUQ to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. A spokesman for the AIB, Tunji Oketunbi, in a statement on Thursday, directed further enquiries on the occurrence to the NCAA. The statement titled ‘Update on Air Peace Aircraft incident at  Lagos Airport,’ insisted that the aircraft suffered a burst tyre during taxing, according to a footage download obtained from the aircraft’s Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder. The statement read, “We refer to the occurrence involving a Boeing 737-300 aircraft with nationality and registration marks 5N-BUQ, operated by Air Peace Ltd, which occurred at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos on Monday, March 8, 2021. “Initial findings made by the Accident Investigation Bureau, Nigeria following a download of the aircraft’s Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder revealed that the aircraft experienced a burst tyre during taxing. “As the occurrence falls under the category of incident, AIB-N has therefore ceded the investigation to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.
