Sodiq Oyeleke The Chief Executive Officer of Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk, has added a new title: He is now to be addressed as Technoking of Tesla. The Chief Financial Officer, Zach Kirkhorn, also takes on a new title and is now to be known, called and addressed as Master of Coin. The new titles are without prejudice to their old titles of CEO and CFO respectively. This was disclosed in their SEC filing early Monday under Item 8.01, in which the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was formally notified. The SEC filing states: “Effective as of March 15, 2021, the titles of Elon Musk and Zach Kirkhorn have changed to Technoking of Tesla and Master of Coin, respectively. Elon and Zach will also maintain their respective positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.” The filing was signed by Kirkhorn under his old title of Chief Financial Officer. Elon has also updated his verified Twitter handle @elonmusk with the new designation. According to Forbes, the change appears to be the latest display of centibillionaire Musk’s idiosyncratic sense of humor, which in the past has included selling flamethrowers to raise funds for The Boring Co., building a medieval guard tower across from SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, or selling red satin shorts to mock investors who lost money shorting Tesla shares.
