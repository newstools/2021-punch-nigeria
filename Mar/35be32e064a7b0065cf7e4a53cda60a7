The Osun State Government, on Monday, said one person had been apprehended in connection with the killing of six members of a family in a Fulani settlement in Wasinmi. An octogenarian, Alhaji Momodu Yaya, popularly known as Samu; his wives, Adamo and Awawu; as well as his three grandchildren, Ibrahim, Abdulahi and Moriamo, were shot dead by gunmen on Saturday. The Chairman, Committee on Peaceful Coexistence between Fulani/Bororo and Crop Farmers in Osun State, Mr Mudasiru Toogun, broke the news of the arrest to our correspondent in Osogbo. Toogun said the suspect was in police custody. “One person has been arrested and he is with the police. The government is working very hard to unravel the mystery behind the incident,” he stated. But when contacted, the spokesperson for the Osun State Police Command, Yemisi Opalola, said detectives were close to a major breakthrough on the case. She, however, did not confirm the arrest. Toogun said the deceased were buried in Ilorin, Kwara State, according to Islamic rites. He stated, “At the burial, the Emir of Ilorin was represented. He appreciated the efforts of the Osun State Government on the way we have handled the matter. We told them that the act was not ethic-related, but a criminal act. We don’t have a problem with the Fulani ethnic group. “Three of the grandchildren were buried at a Muslim burial ground in Ilorin. The Baba and his two wives were buried in his estate opposite the Air Force School, Ilorin. They were buried behind a mosque he built on the estate. “The injured son is in a stable condition and Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has promised to provide the needed support for the victim.” Copyright PUNCH.
