THE Ondo State Government has said it will key into the National Livestock Transformation Plan of the Federal Government, but will not give land to herdsmen. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, who spoke while hosting a delegation of Food and Agriculture Organisation at his office in Akure on Monday, said the NLTP was important as it would curb the incessant clashes between farmers and herders. According to the governor, the NLTP does not include conceding land to herders. He said, “The National Livestock Transformation Programme; a number of our people don’t even know what it is all about. People see it as an attempt to give land to herders. Long before now, I have said we are ready in terms of having areas where the animals can graze. “It (herders-farmer clashes) is becoming too destructive, especially when it comes to your major area which is agriculture. In Ondo State, we are into animal husbandry and fish farming because we have the longest coastline in the country. “We do a lot of fishing; we are also into cash crops which we have been known for long before now. Our farmers are now afraid to go to farm because they can be kidnapped. We will ensure that there is grass and other ways of feeding these livestock. “What we need to do is to encourage haulage, not by bringing the cows by road. You will bring your cows and other livestock to the livestock grazing area and you pay to feed them. The FAO can offer advice. Our people give different interpretations to whatever we say or do.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
