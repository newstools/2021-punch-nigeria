THE Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Monday described Governor Hope Uzodimma as a poor excuse for democracy. The main opposition party also demanded an apology from the governor on behalf of Imo people for allegedly replacing leadership with “publicity stunts” as evidenced with his recent celebration of his first year in office. This was contained in a statement signed by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Ogubundu Nwadike, in Owerri on Monday. The PDP said funds used to organise the celebration could have been used to pay arrears of several months of pensions and gratuity to deserving workers. It described claims of achievements made by the governor during the celebration as tissues of lies. The statement read in part, “As a party, we will like to remind Uzodimma that governance is serious business. Deceit and half-truths cannot advance the cause of good governance. “We repudiate the tissue of lies and urge the governor to stop deceiving the people. Rather than trying to justify the unjustifiable, we invite the governor to look inwards, have a rethink and apologise to the good people of Imo State whose psyche he has destroyed with unprovoked military assault. “Today, civil servants are groaning under the excruciating pains occasioned by selective and non-payment of salaries in most cases 11 months arrears.” In response, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Print Media, Modestus Nwamkpa, said, “The few persons left in Imo PDP are frustrated politicians. They are internally displaced politicians. We understand their frustrations and we pity them.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
