Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The tenure of the Federal Road Safety Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, will end in July, 2022. Oyeyemi, 60, is serving his second term in office with some elements querying the legality of his continued stay, saying this contravened the civil service rules. A national daily had on Monday reported that the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, and the Corps Marshal clocked the mandatory retirement age on November 25 and 26, 2020, respectively. But findings indicated that Oyeyemi is holding a political office as the Corps Marshal and his tenure of office is at the pleasure of the President. This, it was gathered, meant that his appointment, unlike a career civil servant, was not governed by the  Public Service Rules. Section 7 (1) of the FRSC Act, 2007 provides that the Corps Marshal shall be appointed by the President, the only qualification required being that the  person must possess sound knowledge or ability in the organisation and administration of road traffic and road safety matters. A senior officer stated, “The fact that Dr Boboye Oyeyemi is a member of the Corps will not change the status of the office of the Corps Marshal from being a political office to a career public service office.” The source further argued that the heads of the corps had always enjoyed tenure duration, which he said Oyeyemi’s predecessors enjoyed Responding to inquiries from our correspondent on Monday, the FRSC  Education Officer,  Bisi Kazeem, clarified that Oyeyemi still had about 16 months in office. He said, “The Corps Marshal’s appointment is tenure-based. He is in his second and last term, with less than 16 months to go as accorded him by the  Federal Government.” Copyright PUNCH.
