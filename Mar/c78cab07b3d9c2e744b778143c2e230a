Matthew Ochei, Asaba SOME aggrieved opposition political parties in Delta State, on Sunday refuted claims that they’ve withdrawn a suit seeking to stop the state Independent Electoral Commission from going ahead with the March 6, 2021 local government elections. 48 political parties dissociated themselves from an announcement by the state chapter of the Inter-Party Advisory Council that the suit has been withdrawn. In a statement signed by Alex Oyoro and Austin Onori, Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator respectively for the Forum of Like-Minded Political Party Chairmen, in Delta State, the 48 parties described the claim as false. The statement read in part, “It is quite unfortunate that the hungry self-acclaimed IPAC Chairman and Secretary who withdrew the suit they filed on behalf of 74 Political Parties without our consent even when the case has not been heard because a meagre five million naira given to them by a PDP officer and with a promise that they will be given jobs and appointment.” “They fail to understand that we are in Court to seek justice for our parties so that we can all participate in the forthcoming Local Government Council Election in Delta State.” Copyright PUNCH.
