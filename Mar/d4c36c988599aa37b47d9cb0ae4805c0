Peter Dada, Akure An abandoned health centre located in Ikare Akoko, headquarters of the Akoko Northeast Local Government Area of Ondo State, was razed by fire on Sunday. It was gathered that the centre was built by the Federal Government as a constituency project of a former House of Representatives member representing the Akoko North-West/North-East Federal Constituency, Mr Stephen Olemija. The project was allegedly abandoned after the lawmaker left office. It was learnt that the building was burnt down as a result of bush burning by unidentified persons. An eyewitness, Mrs Margaret Owati, confirmed that the fire was caused by bush burning and frantic efforts were made to extinguish it, but nobody could move near the centre due to its high fence. “We called the fire service men in Ikare Akoko, but they complained of non-functional vehicles for such an operation,” she state. A community leader, Chief Teddy Ojuolape, described the incident as unfortunate, because huge sum of money had been expended on the project before the inferno. He called on the government to investigate the incident to determine its remote and immediate cause. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
