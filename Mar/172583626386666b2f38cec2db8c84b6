Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The father of one of the kidnapped students of Girls Secondary Schools,  Jangebe, Malam Ilyasu Gwaram, who was also kidnapped by bandits and rescued by the Zamfara State Government said he was ashamed of himself when the bandits beat him up in front of his kidnapped daughter, Zainab Ilyasu. Ilyasu said, he and other kidnapped persons were beaten every day by the bandits in bid to compel them to pay ransom. He said he was in the bandits’ den for over three months because he was not able to pay N1m demanded by the bandits. He maintained that his greatest agony and humiliation was when the abducted students of GSS Jangebe  were brought to the place where he was being held captive. “Immediately the girls were brought to the place where I was held captive, I nearly fainted because of the situation my daughter met me in. “The bandits would beat us in the presence of the students. I used to cry like a small child because of the pains, even though my daughter was seeing me. She also used to cry whenever I was beaten.  In fact I felt ashamed of myself,” said Ilyasu.
