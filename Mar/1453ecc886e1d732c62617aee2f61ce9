Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Drivers of petroleum tankers and other articulated vehicles on Wednesday blocked the Benin-Ore highway, at Ofosu, over the killing of two drivers by suspected Fulani herdsmen on Tuesday. Ofosu is a boundary community between Edo and Ondo states. The hoodlums were said to have also made away with an undisclosed amount of money stolen from their victims. The angry drivers, who blocked the ever-busy highway at the military checkpoint, refused all entreaties to vacate the road. A driver who delivers newspapers to Edo State lamented that he had been stuck in the traffic since Wednesday morning, saying his business had been disrupted by the blockade. He said, “It is a terrible experience getting stuck on the road. The protesting drivers said two of their colleagues were robbed and killed by suspected herdsmen. We are all stuck here and our business has been disrupted.” It was also gathered that operatives at the military checkpoint abandoned their posts due to the chaotic atmosphere, while the angry drivers insisted that Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State must come to address them before they open up the road. The Edo State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Kontongs Bello, confirmed the incident, but said the area was under the Ondo State Police Command. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
