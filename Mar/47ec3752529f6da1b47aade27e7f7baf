Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja It is high time the Federal Government stopped the illicit movement of cattle on various roads across the country, retired General Evangelist, Christ Apostolic Church Worldwide, Samuel Abiara, has said. He also charged the government to emulate other developed and emerging economies of the world on how to manage cattle for the betterment of citizens. Abiara, who spoke to journalists in Abuja during a prayer session for the nation, observed that most senior government officials were conversant of gainful attributes obtainable in other climes but would not implement the same in Nigeria. He said, “Although the government is trying on this issue (herders/farmers clashes), I will like to advise the government to borrow a leaf from developed nations where you cannot see an illicit movement of cattle across their roads. “Most of our leaders travel abroad to countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the likes, they can never see these animals moving about the city centres, we must find a way around this.” Abiara added, “It is very embarrassing, even for visitors, to see this happening in our country, so I want to advise the government to make adequate arrangements like other developed countries.” The evangelist also condemned the display of arms by herdsmen and urged the government to act fast on this before it degenerates further. “It is not good that the herdsmen carry arms in the farms, this is uncalled for, the government should find adequate solutions to this,” he said. To avert the food crisis in Nigeria, Abiara urged state governments to invest aggressively in agriculture. He said, “I want to advise all the states to go into farming. When the states have sufficient food and livestock, they will not bother about a shortage of food. “They should go into farming and livestock agriculture too to ensure food sufficiency and avert food crisis in their domains.”
