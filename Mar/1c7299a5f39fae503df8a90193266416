Chairman, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Cross River State Chapter, Mr Robert Obi, has kicked against the proliferation of illegal fuel stations in the state. He spoke when IPMAN paid a courtesy visit to the new Operations Controller, Department of Petroleum Resources, Cross River office, Mr George Ene-Ita. Obi said that the process of being a petroleum product marketer and getting DPR licence was difficult and expensive, saying it was wrong for one to get all the certification only to see someone open an unlicensed and uncertified station beside their own. He also lamented the lack of supply of Dual Purpose Kerosene and Automotive Gas Oil to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation depot in Calabar but to private tank farms in the state leaving them with only one product, the Premium Motor Spirit. He said NNPC tanks were available in Calabar but needed to be cleaned up and slightly recalibrated to take DPK and AGO. He said, “We had complained earlier and the Pipeline and Products Marketing Company promised to send us products but we were told that the Calabar depot doesn’t have enough storage facility. “The chairman of PPMC called and told me to engage with the Managing Director, Storage which I did last year before the advent of COVID-19 but up till now, we still have issues with the tanks and are still not receiving the products even though PPMC is ready to send us products.” Copyright PUNCH.
