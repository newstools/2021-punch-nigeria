Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Federal Government and the Ogun State Government have begun the construction of 500 housing units for victims of the 2018 flood incident in the state. The National Emergency Management Agency and the state government implementation team on Wednesday visited the proposed sites for the project at Soyoye, in the Abeokuta North Local Government of the state, donated by the state government. A predawn downpour pounded Abeokuta and its environs in July 13, 2018, leaving many houses and township roads flooded and destroying household valuables. Following the incident, the Federal Government pledged to support the victims on a short term basis with relief materials and also help to find permanent solutions by providing houses in safer places. The Director of Relief and Rehabilitation, NEMA, Kayode Fagbemi, during the visit disclosed that the project was part of Federal Government’s efforts to rehabilitate victims of the flood incident. He said “The building we are looking at will be about 500. This approval has been gotten since January 2020. You will recall that in January 2020, there was COVID-19; we could not do many things. “We are collaborating with the state; the state is going to support part of the project and will ensure that we can achieve that. We know that there is a little bit of inflation, but it’s nobody’s fault, we are going to work to ensure that we achieve our target.” The state Commissioner for Housing, Jagunmolu  Omoniyi, assured that the state government would support the Federal Government in terms of physical infrastructure and other necessary support that NEMA would request to ensure smooth delivery on the presidential mandate.
