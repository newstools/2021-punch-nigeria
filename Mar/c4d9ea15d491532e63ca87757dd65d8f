Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate has urged the Federal Government to immediately initiate a Build-Operate-Transfer or Public-Private Partnership arrangement for the construction of the abandoned Badagry-Sokoto Expressway. The upper chamber passed the resolution on Wednesday after it considered a motion titled, ‘Need for the construction of the Badagry-Sokoto Expressway to promote economic growth and development.’ The motion was sponsored by Senator Sadiq Umar (APC, Kwara North), and seven other senators. According to Umar, the Badagry-Sokoto Expressway is a Federal Government road which connects 12 states. The lawmaker recalled that the road was initiated as part of the 4th National Development Plan started by the General Olusegun Obasanjo regime in 1978. He said it was abandoned in 1979, over 40 years ago, after Obasanjo handed over power to Alhaji Shehu Shagari. He said, “The original conception of this expressway was a linkage road between the North and South and some West African countries through the Seme border; to ease carriage of goods across the borders as it connects Apapa seaports and Seme land border, as well as one of the largest industrial hubs in the country, the Agbara Industrial Estate.” Copyright PUNCH.
