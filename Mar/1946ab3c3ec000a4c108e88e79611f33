The audit further observed that the motor vehicles’ logbooks had not been updated, making it difficult to track the movement of these vehicles and track their record of maintenance. “It is also noted that some official vehicles carry private number plates and registered numbers. The above anomalies are because of failure on the part of the management to ensure proper record keeping, due process in the ministry. “The Permanent Secretary should account for the 55 vehicles not presented during the audit. He should also be sanctioned in accordance with provision of FR3129.” YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Lagos, Chinese investors sign agreement on automobile assembly plant The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Abel Olumuyiwa, however, failed to defend the allegation. Also, his efforts to present some vehicles as part of the alleged missing vehicles were rejected because the vehicles had no chassis number.
