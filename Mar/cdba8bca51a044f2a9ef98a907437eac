In the wake of the outrage that greeted the increase in the price of Premium Motor Spirit also known as petrol, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, on Friday, deleted an earlier published template announcing that the new price of petrol has reached N212.6 per litre.

The ex-depot price is the price at which the product is sold by the NNPC to marketers at the depots.

Nigerian marketers usually use the upper band for pump price. The expected ex-depot price, as seen in the template, is N206.42, while the landing cost is N189.61. With ex-depot price standing at N206.42 per litre, the March template (now deleted)  showed that the landing cost for petrol per litre is N189.61.
