The witness told the court that he was a management consultant. He said his firm, Crincad & Cari Nigeria Limited, was contracted by the PRTT for consultancy service. He told the court that one of the choice properties the PRTT recovered and handed over to the EFCC was grossly undervalued from N6bn in 2011 and sold to a renowned lawyer in 2015 for N1bn.
