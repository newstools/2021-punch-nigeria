A Lagos State High Court in Ikeja has adjourned till May 27, 2021 for the adoption of final written addresses in the case of a collapsed guesthouse of the Synagogue Church of All Nations. The Lagos State Government had prosecuted the SCOAN over the collapsed building, which killed 116 worshipers of the church on September 12, 2014. The defendants were two engineers, Oladele Ogundeji and Akinbela Fatiregun, charged alongside their companies — Hardrock Construction and Engineering Company and Jandy Trust Ltd. They were charged with 110 counts bordering on involuntary manslaughter, while the registered trustees of SCOAN were charged with one count of building without approval. The Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions accused the defendants of violating Section 75 of the Urban and Regional Planning Law of Lagos State 2010, as well as Section 222 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. At the resumed proceedings on Thursday, the court was informed about the death of Fatiregun and served a copy of his death certificate. However, the presiding judge, Justice Lateef Lawal-Akapo, who noted that the defence had filed their final written addresses, said he needed time to write his judgement on the matter. While appealing to the counsel, the judge said, “It is not convenient for me to take the adoption of final written addresses because of the workload in this court.” Justice Lawal-Akapo subsequently adjourned till May 27, 2021, for the adoption of the final written addresses.
