The Ondo State House of Assembly, on Monday, said only two people in the Assembly are in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission over the allegation of fraud and not four as earlier reported in the media. It was earlier reported that the Clerk of the House, Mr Bode Aladeyelu; a lawmaker, Mr Bankole Felemugudu, representing Akoko South West Constituency, and two other civil servants, were detained by the anti-graft agency but the Assembly said only the Clerk and the lawmaker were detained. Speaking on the development, the spokesman of the House, Gbenga Omole, said the two civil servants were not in the custody of the anti-graft agency. Omole noted that the N2.4 million that was allegedly mismanaged, which led to the detention of the duo, was not missing, saying it was in the coffer of the state Assembly. He said, ” two people in the custody of the EFCC are the Clerk of the Assembly and Honorable Bankole Felemugudu. They are being interrogated and before the end of the day (Monday) they would be bailed and released from custody. “No fund is missing, the money they are talking about is in the account of the House.” He noted that the EFCC acted on a petition written by one of the members of the Assembly.
