The Niger State Government has directed the closure of all Public Secondary Schools for two weeks commencing from Friday, March 12 to March 26. The Commissioner for Education Hanatu Jibrin, gave the directive during an emergency consultative meeting with the leadership of Association of the Proprietors of Private Schools and the Association of Model Islamic Schools; Executive Chairman, Niger State Universal Basic Education Board; heads of education agencies, directors and other stakeholders in the state. The commissioner said the directive was based on the decision earlier taken during a meeting with various security agencies in the state. She said although 22 secondary schools (11 day and 11 boarding) had earlier been closed, the two weeks closure of all Secondary schools will give security agencies the time needed to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all public secondary schools. She said the exercise would provide an all-inclusive mechanism that would guarantee sustainable security and safety of students, and teachers in the state. The commissioner reiterated the governmentâ€™s commitment to leave no stone unturned to ensure that all schools were safe for effective teaching and learning. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
