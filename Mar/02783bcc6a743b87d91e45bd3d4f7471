A Peoples Democratic Party aspirant for the Anambra governorship election scheduled for November, 2021, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, says Nigeria will fare better, when it is restructured. Okonkwo spoke after obtaining his expression of interest and nomination forms at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja, on Monday. He said, “It has become obvious from the things happening around that we need to rethink our corporate existence. I am one that believes that a stronger nation is beneficial to all. “We have had in the past, the republican system where we had some regional leadership and regional government. “A typical state has really about 80 per cent of what they need to run itself. So, when you have state assembly, you have your local government and then you have your laws and bye laws to generate your own revenue and use it to run your budget; then it has covered a lot more unless you are coming from a state that obviously has a larger natural resource that makes you earn more. “But a state like Anambra, what we have is skill; that is our own oil and gas for now. I am one who believes that we support discussions on how we should engage and come into a mutually acceptable situation where we should give more powers to the state. “The local government obviously must be independent because any development that is not bottom up, then a larger percentage of the population will not feel the impact of government. I support discussions that will give more powers to the states.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
