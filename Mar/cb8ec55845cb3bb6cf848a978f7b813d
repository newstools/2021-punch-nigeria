Nike Popoola Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc, a general insurance service provider, says it has embarked on an insurance awareness, tagged ‘If you love it, insure it’. A statement from the firm said the campaign was aimed at sensitising the general populace on the need to insure their valued assets. Speaking on the purpose of the campaign, the Executive Director, Operations, CHI Plc, Mary Adeyanju, said, “Insurance as a risk mitigator brings peace of mind and takes anxiety away.” Besides indemnifying individuals and organisations from covered losses, she said insurance helps to aid adequate planning and unnecessary financial burden in times of loss. The company also stated that this was in addition to the competitive rates being offered on all classes of insurance including motor, travel, home, marine, group personal accident, all risks, and many other covers.
