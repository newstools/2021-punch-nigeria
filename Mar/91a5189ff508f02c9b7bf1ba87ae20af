Tony Okafor, Awka A former governor of Anambra State and the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in 2019 general elections, Mr Peter Obi, has described Nigeria as a sad irony where political thugs earn more than professors. Obi stated this on Wednesday during the presentation of a book authored by Prof Chinyere Okunna of the Department of Mass Communication,  Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Awka, Anambra State.

He said, “Prof. Okunna (the author), who we are celebrating today; I can tell you earns less than a political thug. Nigeria prefers paying bandits and dialoguing with them paying or meeting with resourceful and hard-working intellectuals. “I never knew Okunna before I appointed her commissioner when I was governor, but I became interested in her when I saw her CV as a nominee. “Many people protested her appointment because she was not a member of our political party but I remained resolute to appoint her because I needed the right team to do the job. “People come to me to ask for advice on the kind of people they should give appointments to and I say to them, ‘take people who can tell you the truth no matter how painful’.
