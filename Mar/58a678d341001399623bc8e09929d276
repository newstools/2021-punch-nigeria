Temiloluwa O’Peters The Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria and other key stakeholders in the telecom and ICT sector will this month brainstorm and chart a pathway towards the realisation of the new target of 70 per cent of broadband penetration. In a statement signed by the President, ATCON, Ikechukwu Nnamani and ATCON, Publicity Secretary, Wole Abu, the association said it would host a virtual structured engagement with key stakeholders in the Nigerian telecom and ICT sector on the new national broadband plan 2020-2025. The event slated for March 25 is themed ‘Realising the new set target of 70 per cent of broadband penetration’. The association’s executives said the aim of the programme was to ensure that the national broadband plan was adequately positioned to deliver its ultimate purposes for the generality of Nigerians, more quickly and strategically. They added that it would complement the various strategic activities already embarked upon by the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to achieve the set target of broadband penetration in Nigeria with great speed. ATCON said, “It is an opportunity to review the relevance of the Nigerian policy environment vis-a-vis the telecom operating environment and will serve as a veritable platform to galvanise the needed input that reflects the thinking of the telecom and ICT sector. “It will leverage on the wide spectrum of ATCON sub-group for effective participation in the new Nigerian National Broadband Plan 2020-2025 by giving them the opportunity to access the plan and suggest various ways to speed up the realisation of the established target by the government.” Copyright PUNCH.
