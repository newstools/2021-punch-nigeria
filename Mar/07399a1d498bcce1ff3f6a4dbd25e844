Tony Okafor,Awka THE South-East chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria has expressed its support for Governor Willie Obiano’s pronouncement of treating any herder illegally possessing firearms as a criminal. The Chairman of the group, Gidago Sidikki, stated this on Thursday while reacting to a statement credited to Obiano wherein he ordered the police and other security agencies to treat any herder found in possession of AK-47 rifle as an armed robber. The governor had in a stakeholders’ security summit in Awka on Monday ordered security agencies to treat any herder carrying AK-47 as a criminal. Obiano said the order would be in force after the state had taken a headcount of herders in the state. Sidikki said, “The governor’s order is in line with the already existing agreement between the South-East governors and the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria. “My members have been having a good relationship with their host communities in spite of some isolated cases of misunderstanding, which is normal in every human society.
