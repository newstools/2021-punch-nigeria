THE Ondo State Government asked the immediate past deputy governor of the state, Mr. Agboola Ajayi, to return all government vehicles in his possession. Our correspondent gathered in Akure on Monday that the request was sequel to allegations that Mr. Ajaji was still keeping government property in his possession after the expiration of his tenure on February 23, 2021. The state government, in a letter dated February 16, 2021, directed Ajayi to submit all government property, including vehicles and other movable and immovable assets in his possession, to the General Administration Department of the Governor’s Office, on or before February 23, 2021. It was learnt that a lack of response from him prompted the state government to issue another letter titled, ‘Re: submission of all government properties’, dated March 1, 2021, which was also sent to him. In the letter, Ajayi was asked to return one Land Cruiser SUV and two new Toyota Hilux vehicles. When contacted, the embattled former deputy governor explained that he was yet to see the letter asking him to return the vehicles. He also said, “I will respond to them appropriately.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
