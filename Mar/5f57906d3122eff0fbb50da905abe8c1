Nike Popoola Continental Reinsurance Plc has announced that the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dr Femi Oyetunji, will retire from the company. The reinsurance company has also inaugurated its new headquarters in Lagos. It said these on Friday in a statement titled ‘Continental Reinsurance Plc positioned to deliver value post COVID-19 recovery of African nations as Group Managing Director/CEO, Dr Femi Oyetunji, announces his retirement’. Oyetunji stated that 2020 was one of the most challenging years ever experienced globally, following the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement said. He said, “We faced daunting business conditions, but our teams responded with the enterprise and commitment I have come to expect. We boldly adapted to the business environment and embraced a range of new opportunities.” The announcement coincided with the publication of an independent brand survey by Kantar that recognised Continental Re as a credible pan-African company. Conducted in six representative markets, the survey showed that the company exceeded the global reputation benchmark. On this development, Oyetunji stated, “It was gratifying to obtain an overall score of 79 points which is above the global benchmark of 73. Now, however, our goal is to keep pushing higher.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
