Temiloluwa O’Peters GOtv Nigeria has announced the return of its reward campaign ‘GOtv dey your side’, designed to reward loyal customers with discounts and more content. The company said in a statement on Tuesday that the customers on GOtv Jolli and GOtv Jinja would enjoy discounts up to 32 per cent and an upgraded viewing on GOtv Max from Tuesday. The Chief Executive Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe, explained that the offer was borne out of GOtv’s desire to show support to loyal subscribers by offering them more for less in an economic situation worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are committed to Nigeria’s efforts to curb the spread of the COVID-19, part of which requires people to stay home more. With this offer, we are making their stay at home a lot more enjoyable and affordable,” Ugbe said. GOtv noted that the limited time offer was open to GOtv Jolli and Jinja customers when they renewed their subscription. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
