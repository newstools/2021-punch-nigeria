Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin The Federal Government has been urged to update the global map of Nigeria to provide more information about the country for investors wishing to come to the country. Speaking during the annual Conference of the Association of Private Practicing Surveyors of Nigeria, which ended in Ilorin on Friday, Kwara State chairman of the association, Oluwafemi Opaleye, said the enabling law that would encourage investment in the country was not yet available. He said, “Nigeria has no global landmap to tell investors where there are mineral resources, farm land and animal husbandry as well as other areas of interest.” Opaleye said the country was still using the old land laws. He said, “If we want to encourage investors, we have to update our land map, tell the investors the content of the land they want to invest on and we should give them the enabling environment. “Goverment should come up with formidable solutions. We are surveyors and we are ready to assist the goverment to get the land law reviewed and follow the content to the letter.” Also Speaking at the Conference, National Chairman of APPSN,  Abayomi Babadoye, noted that the intention of the Land Use Act promulgated in 1977 was good but its implementation had been shoddy. He added that goverments at all levels failed to set up a committee that to implement the act. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
