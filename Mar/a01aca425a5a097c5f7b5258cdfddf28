It was gathered that the abductors abandoned the cleric’s car at the scene of the incident as they whisked him away. A member of the local vigilante group who spoke with journalists on the incident said that even though they heard terrifying gun shots by the kidnappers, there was no way they could combat the hoodlums with their ‘shoot and run’ guns.
