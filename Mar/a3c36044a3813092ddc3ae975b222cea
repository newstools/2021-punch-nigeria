Amnesty International has called on Nigerian authorities to immediately release Mahdi Shehu, the whistleblower who has been exposing alleged corruption by the Katsina State government and the inflation of money paid as ransom to kidnappers in the state. A video on social media shows the moment Shehu was dragged to court by policemen despite being in a poor health condition. According to rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, who shared the video on Twitter, “Shehu is being dehumanised because of his revelation on the abduction, the ransom paid and the racket ongoing in Katsina State. Governor Masari, what are you afraid of?” READ ALSO: NCAA suspends Azman Air operations She added, “What is happening to Mahdi Shehu affects us all. It is our monies that are being used to pay ransom and some are using it as an opportunity to inflate the amount and enrich themselves. His allegations should be investigated and not the state clamping on him. #FreeMahadiShehu.” Reacting to the situation, Amnesty, in a statement on social media, condemned the detention and ill-treatment of the whistleblower.
