A petitioner, Marc Chidibere Nwadi, has been awarded N7.5 million by the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Restitution and Inquiry set up to investigate cases of police brutality especially involving officers of the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The petitioner had complained that he spent six years in the prison without trial. Nwadi had alleged that his long stay in prison was because he could not offer a bribe. Chairperson of the panel, Doris Okuwobi, delivered the judgment on Friday. She upheld that the petitioner suffered unduly in the hands of police officers. Okuwobi subsequently presented a cheque of N7.5 million to the petitioner on behalf of the state government. Details laterâ€¦
