Wale Oyewale, Ibadan THE Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party Primary Election Committee for Oyo State, Senator Abdul, has said the party’s local government primaries were free, fair and credible. He spoke when he led other members of the committee to present a report of the exercise to the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, at the Government House, Ibadan. Ningi said, “So far, so good, the electioneering process is satisfactory to us as a committee. This is among the very best local government primaries that I have attended. I am satisfied, especially with the openness of the state government and the party. “We discovered there was a free and fair election because we went round the metropolis. We went to the outskirts of the city to witness the local council election and we are satisfied with what we have seen.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
