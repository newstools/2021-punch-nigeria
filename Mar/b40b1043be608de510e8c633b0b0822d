Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, who is representing Abia South Senatorial District at the National Assembly, has said he survived impeachment three times when he was a deputy governor to Senator Orji Kalu in Abia State. Abaribe stated this in his new book, ‘Made in Aba’ which will be unveiled today (Monday) in Abuja. Abaribe said, “I was not in the league of ‘Egusi’ peelers that thronged his mother’s abode for whatever reason. “His minions had not succeeded in binding me to some ethereal commitment on any false loyalty scale. “I lasted exactly three years and nine months in office, before I threw in the towel. “The bumpy ride ended on 7th March 2003, when I finally resigned and switched parties. “The one tenure was characterised by three attempts at impeachment.  The one thread that runs through them all is that government can make no error. “Once the idea stuck in the head of the chief executive, persons around him would leave no stone unturned to actualise the desired end. “The first attempt at impeaching me died on the floor of the House of Assembly, roundly defeated for the baseless shenanigan that it was. “The second attempt, I survived, by a hair’s breadth: by just one vote differential.  The third, I did not bother to respond to.” He added that during Kalu’s administration, two other deputy governors after him were impeached and removed from office. .Copyright PUNCH.
