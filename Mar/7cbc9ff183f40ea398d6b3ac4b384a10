A professor of parasitology, Federal University, Lokoja, Prof. Jaqueline Badaki, has said basic hygiene is vital in tackling elephantiasis. Badaki stated this during a two-day training of 44 health workers in Gombe organised by Amen Health Care Foundation. She said, “Elephantiasis is categorised into different grades; at the early stage which is grade one, the swelling of the affected part is not visible; the second grade, the swelling becomes visible and in the third grade, the affected area becomes hard as stone. “But with basic hygiene elephantiasis can be managed and treated.” The Executive Secretary Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Abdulrahaman Shuaibu, said the training was timely because it will go a long way in building the capacity of the state health workers in managing elephantiasis. “Elephantiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease which is epidemic in Gombe and the adverse effect of the disease on the population has negative impact economically and socially,” Shuaibu said. The president and founder of Amen Health Care, Mrs Rita Oguntoyinbo, lauded the participants for making themselves available for the training. She said, “Most people that develop elephantiasis do not know what to do, hence the need to pick them early, provide them the care that will enable them to live a meaningful life and not to suffer morbidity. “Sometimes patients developed sore which is very difficult to manage but if detected early could be managed.” Elephantiasis, according to medicalnewstoday.com, is a tropical disease caused by parasitic worms that are spread through mosquito bites.
