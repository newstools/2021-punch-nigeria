Sodiq Oyeleke A former Governor of Ekiti State, Mr Ayodele Fayose, has denied plans to attend a reconciliation meeting with Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, today. Both Fayose and Makinde have polarised the PDP as a result of their differences as both party leaders have been supporting different factions of the party in the South-West. Both of them have also nominated different men and women for party positions in the forthcoming zonal congress of the party in the South-West.

In a bid to reconcile the two leaders, ex-Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola of Osun State has reportedly convened a peace meeting. His earlier meetings in South-West states had been shunned by Fayose supporters, who alleged that any meeting called by Oyinlola “is self-serving and for personal gains.” READ ALSO: Senate queries 55 vehicles allegedly missing from federal ministry While reacting to reports that he would be attending a reconciliation meeting with Makinde, Fayose tweeted, “My attention has been drawn to a publication that I will attend a reconciliation meeting by former Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola, today (Friday). “Let me state clearly that I have no business with Prince Oyinlola’s so-called reconciliation.” The crisis between Fayose and Makinde started over the latter’s role in the Ekiti PDP crisis as well as the leadership of the party in the South-West.
