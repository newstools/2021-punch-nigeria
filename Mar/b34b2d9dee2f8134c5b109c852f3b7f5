Truck drivers under the National Association of Road Transport Owners have accused Hitech Construction Company Ltd, a construction company rehabilitating the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, as part of the impediments frustrating the electronic call-up system. Vice-Chairman, NARTO, Dry Cargo Section, Abdullahi Inuwa who spoke to our correspondent on the phone sought government intervention on the Tin Can stretch of the port access road. He said, “We have challenges most especially in Tin Can axis. The contractor is not helping issues. The contractor is part of the impediments frustrating the e-call up system. “This is because the contractor blocks some portions of the road along the Tin Can axis, then at midnight he opens the road to some certain group of people to pass. We don’t know what their reasons are. We hope something can be done regarding that.” Speaking regarding the status of the oil tankers which were previously seen on the Tin Can axis on Tuesday, Inuwa said the Lagos taskforce had begun to clear the road on Thursday. He said, “There is progress everyday. I learnt that it is not up to an hour that the task force came to mile 2 to clear some of the trucks along Tin Can axis.” A video posted on Twitter on Thursday by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor of Lagos State on New Media, Jubril Gawat, showed the task force team ridding the axis of fuel tankers.
