The President, Major Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has appointed 42 traditional rulers as chancellors and 27 other individuals as pro-chancellors of some federal universities and inter-university centres. This was contained in a statement by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, on Thursday, revealing that the decision was in line with the establishment of new universities and also to replace deceased chancellors. He said, “Mr. President has, following the establishment of additional universities, approved the appointment, reassignment of chancellors to 43 federal universities. The exercise is intended to also replace deceased chancellors of some federal universities. “As royal fathers, these chancellors are expected to be the moral compass of the various universities to which they are assigned. They have been taken from their kingdoms and primary constituencies to other kingdoms and these appointments are expected to play a role in cementing relationships between communities in the country.” Below is the list of chancellors and their assigned institutions, as revealed in the statement: 1.
