Commuters were left stranded for several hours on Thursday as residents of the Urokuosa community, Uhunmwode Local Government Area of Edo State, blocked the Benin-Auchi-Lokoja Road in protest over insecurity. The blockade, the second in less than a month, left many commuters disappointed as both sides of the road were blocked by the protesters, who made bonfires with disused tyres in the centre of the road. It was learnt that the protest was triggered by the recent activities of kidnappers on the road. The protesters, while recounting the daily abduction of travellers on the road, said a driver of one the popular transport companies was shot dead last week. Some of the protesters called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to come to the rescue of the masses plying the road by putting an end to the activities of criminals on the route. “We are calling on President Buhari, who we voted for due to the change he promised us, to please come to the rescue of those plying this road daily. These criminals have become daring as their activities have led to the abduction and death of many people,” one of the protesters said. The Edo State Police Command spokesman, SP Kontongs Bello, confirmed the incident and said the protesters dispersed after the police had a discussion with them. “The information was that those who blocked the road were protesting against insecurity, but they opened the road and dispersed as soon as the police in the area had a discussion with them,” he stated.
