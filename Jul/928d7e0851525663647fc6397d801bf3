The Chief Executive Officer of Rotimax Integrated Service and Alcochem Hygiene Nigeria, Mr Tolu Caleb, has advocated access to clean and safe water for Nigerians. Caleb said this while unveiling a borehole donated by the firm to the people of Isolo community in Akure, Ondo State. He said the gesture of the pest control firm was part of the corporate social responsibility of the company. “This unveiling of the borehole facility reflects the importance of corporate social responsibility for all of us. I also believe that CSR continues to be important in the company’s efforts to see that there is easy access to water in the community. “I lived in Akure for few years and that particular area; there exists just a single well that brings out water during the dry season. You can imagine a whole community drinking from just one well. It was born out of the fact that I knew about the town, their challenges and the need to enable them have access to safe water,” Caleb said. He added that the project which was financed by the firm would be extended to other areas in need of safe and clean water. Caleb said there was the need for other corporate organisations to key into this initiative which its direct result would have a great impact on Nigerian society and also makes the world a better place. According to a United Nations global analysis report published in 2015 63 million Nigerians do not have access to an improved source of drinking water. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
