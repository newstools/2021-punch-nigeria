FORMER Governor of Zamfara state, Alhaji Abdul Aziz Yari has donated 575 cows and 800 rams to members of the All Progressive Congress in the state. This was announced in Gusau on Thursday by the representative of the former governor, Alhaji Lawal Liman, at the APC stakeholders meeting held at the party’s secretariat. Liman said the gesture was part of the former governor’s efforts in assisting the party members to celebrate the Eid- El-Kabir. He said the animals would be distributed to all the 147 wards in the state as soon as the committee for the distribution of the animals was set up. He maintained that both the old and new party members would benefit from the gesture. Liman also urged the APC members to continue praying for peace to return to the state. Copyright PUNCH.
