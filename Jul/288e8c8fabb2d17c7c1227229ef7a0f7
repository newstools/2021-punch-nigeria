A Councillorship aspirant, Osularu Muyiwa, has dragged the Vice Chairman, Caretaker Committee of Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun State, Efuwape Muhammed; the All Progressives Congress and the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission, to the Sagamu High Court, over the alleged illegal substitution of his name. The aspirant in an originating court summons dated July 8, and filed by law firms of Fazaz Segun Daud and Co. and Hussein Omikunle and Co, challenged the party’s action. The OGSIEC has fixed the forthcoming local government election for July 24. Osularu in the affidavit he deposed to, claimed that he won the APC councillorship primaries for Ward 5, Iperu Remo held on May 20, 2021 but his name was allegedly substituted for the first respondent, Muhammed. Osularu, in the court summons, urged the court to compel the three respondents to appear before it within seven days after being served the court process. He is praying the court to determine, among other things, whether it was lawful according to section 87 (9) of the Electoral Acts 2010 (as amended) and APC constitution and electoral guidelines to substitute candidate’s name without his consent. He also urged the court to grant an order nullifying the name of Muhammed as the APC councillorship candidate for Ward 5, Iperu Remo. Osularu pleaded with the court to order the second respondent, APC to forward his name to the third respondent, OGSIEC and the third respondent must accept the list, publicise and print his name on the ballot paper as the APC councillorship candidate for Ward 5, Iperu Remo in the coming local government elections. The applicant also urged the court to give an order of perpetual injunction restraining Muhammed from parading himself as the standard bearer of APC for Ward 5 in the coming local government elections.
