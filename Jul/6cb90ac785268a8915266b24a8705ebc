Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday, described the decision of Southern Governors Forum to enact laws to ban open grazing of livestock in the region as a bold and patriotic move that will bring to an end the lingering crisis caused by armed herdsmen. The Governor in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, also lauded his counterparts in Southern Nigeria for backing their May 11 Asaba declaration against open grazing with the resolve to legally prohibit nomadic cattle rearing; a resolution which conforms with the global best practice of animal husbandry. The statement read in part, “The Governor also commends the Southern Governors Forum for their position on rotation of the Presidency between the north and south, beginning from 2023. “Governor Ortom believes that only equity, fairness and justice can strengthen the unity of Nigeria, give all citizens a sense of belonging and reduce tensions across the country.”
