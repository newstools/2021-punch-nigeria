China has issued a circular banning the construction of new skyscrapers above 500 meters amid efforts to tighten scrutiny over high-rises. All buildings above 250 meters are strictly restricted, and if they needed to build new ones, the construction plans should be reviewed over a slew of aspects. These aspects should include fire safety and filed with the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said the circular issued by the National Development and Reform Commission. For buildings above 100 meters, the construction plans would face strict scrutiny over their seismic performance. The high-risings should match with the city’s size and firefighting capacity, it said. Local governments have been improving the management of construction projects in terms of safety and quality, however, there were still loopholes that may lead to safety risks, the circular said. The circular stressed strengthening the management of construction projects, adhering to the principle of quality first, and ensuring the safety of people’s lives and property, it said. (Xinhua/NAN)
