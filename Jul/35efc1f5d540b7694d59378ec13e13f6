LASACO Assurance Plc has paid N365m group life insurance claims to 159 relatives of deceased workers in the State Universal Basic Education Board and Local Government in Lagos State. During the presentation of the cheques to the beneficiaries on Friday, the Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr Wale Ahmed, said Lagos State was taking care of both the living and the dead. The presentation was attended by some relatives of the deceased workers. He said, “Today, we are remembering the dead. Our government has shown priority to the welfare of its staff. “We appeal to the beneficiaries to ensure that the money is judiciously used to take care of the children of the deceased to become responsible in the society.” The commissioner, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Morenike Sanyaolu, said employees always got their salaries before the end of the month. According to the commission, the cheques presentation was the first batch for the year and another presentation will take place later. The Managing Director, LASACO Assurance, Razzaq Abiodun, said the underwriting firm had continued to be responsible and paid over N3bn on the group life insurance policy for workers in Lagos over the years. He said the disbursement of the monies to the beneficiaries had been possible because the Lagos State Government had remained consistent in payment of premiums on the policy. “LASACO is committed to prompt claims payment and we are proud to be associated with Lagos State,” he said.
