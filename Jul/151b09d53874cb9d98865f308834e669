Manchester City’s friendly at Troyes, scheduled for July 31, has been called off, the newly-promoted French side said Wednesday, citing “sanitary restrictions linked to the critical development of Covid-19, notably in the United Kingdom.” Had City made the cross-Channel trip they would have had to quarantine thereafter and therefore the game will be called off to avoid what would have been a major disruption of the English Premier League champions’ pre-season preparations.
