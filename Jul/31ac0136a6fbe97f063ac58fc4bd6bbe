Former D’Tigers captain, Olumide Oyedeji has commended the team for their historic 90-87 win over Team USA in Las Vegas on Sunday, but warned that the players shouldn’t allow the victory get into their heads. It was the first time an African side will beat the US in a basketball game. “I am not taking away the credit from the team for this win. I am really excited, the win is a record and I hope that we can build on it, go to the Olympics in Japan and win a medal,” Oyedeji told The PUNCH. “It will be a tough task but it is realisable. The team should not get carried away and lose focus.” D’Tigers squad heading for the Olympics is made up largely of players born abroad to Nigerian parents, with Miami Heat star Precious Achiuwa the player born in Nigeria. Oyedeji, however, advocated for the inclusion of more local talents in coach Mike Brown’s squad. “I guess I’m feeling this way because I’m an home-grown player and I’m back home to give young people the chance to fulfil their dreams. I could have stayed back outside Nigeria to continue my progress in life, but my desire is to give back to the society that made me.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
