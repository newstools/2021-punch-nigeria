The sitting of the ad hoc committee of Kano State House of Assembly investigating the suspended Chairman of the state Public Complaints and Anti-corruption Commission, Muhuyi Rimigado, has been postponed until a later date. The postponement, according to the Secretary of the committee and Deputy Director, Legal Services, Kano State House of Assembly, Abdullahi Bature, was due to a letter forwarded to the House by counsel for Rimigado stating that he was indisposed and requesting some documents. “We were served a letter by the lawyers of the suspended chairman of the commission stating that he is ill, attending to his health in Abuja and demanding some documents, which we will oblige them,” he said. When asked on the next date of the sitting, Bature said that would be communicated to the counsel for Rimingado at a later date. Speaking to journalists, Rimingado’s lawyer, Usman Fari, said the suspended anti-graft agency boss was attending to his health in Abuja and had forwarded documents from the National Hospital Abuja to the committee.
