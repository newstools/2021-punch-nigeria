Singer Victor AD has revealed how he was healed of a skin disease by the late founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations, Pastor Temitope Joshua, popularly called TB Joshua. Victor AD also revealed the financial and spiritual impact the clergyman had on him while he was alive. He made this known in an Instagram post titled, ‘Tribute To Prophet TB Joshua,’ a day after the late clergyman was buried. The singer wrote, “My Dad, late Mr Emmanuel Adere introduced me and my entire family to SCOAN in 1996 and ever since then you’ve been a blessing to us. “I still remember how God used you to heal me of a skin disease as a little boy, after moving from one hospital to another but all to no avail. You showed me so much undeserving love, helped my family and me countless times. “I remember when I was going through some challenges and I was planning to speak to you about it. But before I did you, reached out to me and gave me over a million naira, and I was like, I was about to tell you that I was going through challenges. You smiled and said I know what you are going through… God is with you. I felt peace in my heart. “You taught me how to pray for grace and God’s mercy and exclude all boasting from my achievements. You never judged me even when you knew my flaws. You welcomed me with so much love and said everyone makes mistakes and mistakes are correctable. “I can go on and on… words are too weak to express your good deeds for this generation. We love you, Daddy. Rest on till will meet again.”
