A Lagos State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Yaba, on Monday, granted bail to the 49 Yoruba Nation agitators, who were arrested by the state police command. A motion for their bail application was filed by human rights lawyers led by Olasupo Ojo and Oladapo Kayode. Among those granted bail are Olasunkanmi Tanimola, Kabiru Lawanson, Chinemerem Emmanuel, Rasaki Musibau, Lukman Ololade, Olasanmi Oladipupo, Bashiru Shittu, Taofeek Abdusalam, Olamilekan Abata, Abdullahi Sikiru, Tosin Adeleye and Babatunde Lawal. The agitators were arrested at Ojota on July 3, 2021, while protesting in support of the actualisation of Yoruba Nation and the command had paraded 47 men and two women in connection with the rally. The Communications Manager for the umbrella body of the Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, Mr Maxwell Adeleye, in a statement on Monday, said the agitators were granted bail in the sum of N300,000 with two sureties each. “One of the sureties must be a family member and the other a community leader or clergy with proof of tax payment,” Adeleye added.
