The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, has said the ministry is partnering with Aurelia in a move to welcome more investors into the Nigerian mining and boost the sector. He said this during a courtesy visit to the Ministry by the management team of Aurelia Mining Company Limited from the UK on Monday. The minister said that the ministry had made efforts towards inviting more investors into the mining sector, adding that the partnership with Aurelia Mining was a result of such efforts. He further disclosed that gold mining would kick-start in Ilesha by a mining company known as Thor Exploration. The minister said, “One of the investors told me in Canada that these are shark-infested waters, who would dare dive in first, and I said okay, Thor Exploration is already in there, and very soon, maybe in the next couple of weeks, they will start their production from Ilesha. “There has been a little delay because of COVID-19. But I spoke with the MD of the company, and in the next couple of weeks, they will start producing gold.” The minister hoped to leverage the success stories from partnering with private firms to drive growth in the mining sector.
