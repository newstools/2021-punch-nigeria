Nigerian Grammy award winner, Burna Boy, has sent an appreciation message to his friends and fans for celebrating him on his 30th birthday. The African Giant took to his Instagram story to thank everyone who went out of their way to celebrate him. He further noted that turning 30 was a big deal for him because there was a time in his life he was not sure he would turn 30. The Odogwu singer wrote, “I really wanna thank everyone involved in making my birthday special. This birthday really meant a lot to me. I remember a time I wasn’t sure I’d even see age 30. From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate everyone who went out of their way to make my day. “Thank you to every club we went to. Thank you to everyone in Miami who held us down. Thank you to everyone back home and all around the world who celebrated me even in my absence. May you all be celebrated the same way. Love you all.” (sic)
