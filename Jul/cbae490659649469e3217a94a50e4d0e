Despite the crisis rocking the All Progressives Grand Alliance, a factional national chairman of the party, Chief Edozie Njoku, has said the party would win the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State. According to him, the only threat to APGA in the state is the Peoples Democratic Party. Speaking with some journalists in Abuja on Sunday, Njoku said he was willing to reconcile with Chief Victor Oye, who was said to have been removed as the national chairman by some party officials. He assured that the internal crisis resulting from the parallel governorship primaries a few weeks ago in Awka, the state capital, would not affect the fortunes of the ruling party in the state. The APGA chieftain further claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission has recognised him as the authentic chairman of the party, notwithstanding its position that he had been suspended. He stated, “Forget about the internal crisis going on, I want to assure every member of the party that APGA will win Anambra state. I don’t need to announce it again because I have been saying that we are going to come together. “I have said that Victor Oye is my last national chairman, and I have no problem reconciling with him. “We observed that someone’s name was released as the candidate of APGA for the Anambra governorship poll. “I want to tell members of APGA to remain calm because there is no need to raise any alarm”. Speaking on the list released by INEC last week, he noted: “My major assurance is that Anambra is an APGA state and the only threat I know is PDP; they can only try their best but Anambra is truly an APGA state.”
