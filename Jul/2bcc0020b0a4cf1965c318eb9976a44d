Roberto Mancini was not too proud to admit his Italy side had been made to ‘suffer’ before their penalty-shootout victory over Spain. The Italians had just 35 per cent possession and needed some dogged resistance to take an enthralling semi-final all the way. But Mancini, while accepting the brilliance of their opponents, gave credit to the character of his players, who will now face England or Denmark in Sunday’s final here at Wembley. “Almost no-one believed we could do it, yet we’re into the final,’ said Mancini following Jorginho’s winning spot-kick. “From day one we have believed we could produce something incredible – but there is still one game to go. “We are delighted to provide a wonderful night of entertainment for the Italian people, and we hope to produce one more. “We knew this would be very tough. In terms of ball possession, Spain are the best around. They caused us problems and we had to dig in when we needed to. “I really want to take my hat off to Spain, they are a wonderful team. It was a very open game, but we kept going. “When you are involved in an intense championship like this, you will always have one match when you have to suffer. And we knew it would be this game. “But, occasionally, you can win matches in a different way.’ To think, Mancini was worried about a lack of support here inside Wembley, as if fearing an occasion sedated by the neutrality of the crowd. He had decried travel and ticketing restrictions as ‘unfair’. The only unjust element of this wonderful contest was the partisan presence of his many thousand countrymen, and boy did his side need that backing to overcome opponents who gave them their toughest test yet.”
