Popular Nollywood actor, Salami Rotimi, has narrated his experience with armed robbers who attacked his car while he was in a traffic jam on Monday. On his verified Instagram page, the actor posted a video showing the damage done to his car by the attackers. “Guys, I just got robbed like an hour ago, I just got robbed along Mile 2,” the actor said in the video. In the caption, Salami clarified that while he was not hurt, his car suffered damages. He also explained that his car was caught between trailers in the standstill traffic when he was attacked. “Four very young boys showed up from nowhere, broke my car glass with gun when I refused to whine down,” he wrote. The filmmaker also said the armed robbers threatened to shoot him and his younger brother who was with him in the car if they refused to drop their phones. While trying to disconnect his other phone, help came his way as motorcyclists parked on the other side of the road chased the boys away. He then warned people not to respond to any WhatsApp chats from his phone number but speak directly with him before transacting any business.
