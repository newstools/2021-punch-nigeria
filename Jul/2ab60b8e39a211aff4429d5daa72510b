The Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has congratulated Nigerians, especially Muslims on the occasion of the Eid-el-Kabir festival. Sanwo-Olu advised them to celebrate with caution in the wake of the third wave of COVID-19 in the country, adding that they should maintain all protocols against the spread of the virus. According to his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, Sanwo-Olu “advised Lagosians, especially Muslim faithful to imbibe the lessons of sacrifice made by Prophet Ibrahim and work for the peace, stability, unity and progress of the country.” Akosile quoted the Governor as saying, “On behalf of my family and government of Lagos State, I join millions of people around the world, to wish our Muslim brothers and sisters in the state and in Nigeria happy Eid-el-Kabir, which comes with significant lessons for mankind. “Eid al-Adha has become a symbolic event in the history of mankind, following the events that led to the sacrifice by Prophet Ibrahim, who held tenaciously to his faith in God despite his unpleasant circumstances at the time. “The festival, therefore, reminds us that there will always be great rewards when we have abiding faith and patience in trying periods; persistence in prayers and tenacity in our belief, as well as sacrifice for the progress of mankind and development of our society.” The Governor also implored Nigerians to support government at state and federal levels in building a better society that is free from violence, insecurity and other social vices.
