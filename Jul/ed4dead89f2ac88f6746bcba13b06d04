The Lagos State Government has said the Jakande Leadership Academy initiative it has planned to build is to train and prepare youths to take up leadership positions, thereby creating society of resourceful individuals. The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, said this, according to a statement on Sunday, on Jordan 105.5FM, on a programme, Lagos in Focus. Omotoso, who explained that the present administration in Lagos had many strategies to ensure youth participation in governance, said, “During the funeral of the late Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, the major thing that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced was that we are going to build the leadership academy because Jakande showed sterling qualities in leadership. “We felt the only way to immortalise him is to build a leadership academy that people can come into and gain experience, have training and skills for leadership qualities that have made people like Alhaji Jakande, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to be great today.” Omotosho added that the government was supporting youths in the state in the area of entrepreneurship, tourism, entertainment and technology. “There are no fewer than 4,000 young graduates in various companies under the state internship programme. They are trained for jobs opportunities and made employable. The Lagos State Employment Trust Fund encourages people interested in business with low-interest loans,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
