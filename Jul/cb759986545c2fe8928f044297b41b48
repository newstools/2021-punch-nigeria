The Presiding Pastor-in-charge of the First Baptist Church, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Dr Olukayode Ayinde, said on Saturday that he was not the person arraigned before an Ekiti State Magistrate’s Court for the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl. Ayinde, who said he had been inundated with calls and visits since the news of the arraignment broke out on Thursday, said it was a matter of coincidence of names, pointing out that the cleric, with the names Dr Olukayode Samuel Ayinde, remanded for the alleged rape was another person who belonged to another church. The cleric, who spoke at a press conference in Ado Ekiti, said the clarification became necessary to prevent his hard earned reputation from being tarnished for offence he did not commit. He also cautioned those attempting to tarnish his name by linking him with the incident to desist, threatening to seek redress in court. He said, “I have been receiving calls from Baptists and members of the public on why the purveyors of the news cleverly linked me with the accused person.” According to the charge, the defendant, one Rev. Ayinde was allegedly charged “for offence reasonably suspected to be rape of a 12-year old girl sometime in August, 2020”. But the Baptist pastor said, “I wish to categorically state that after much finding, the said Olukayode Samuel Ayinde, remanded at the correctional service for rape is of another church and therefore has nothing to do with me or the church I preside over.” Copyright PUNCH.
