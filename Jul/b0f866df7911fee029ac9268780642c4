Gunmen have kidnapped two persons from an event centre in Abalamabie community, Bonny Local Government Area, Rivers State. The gunmen were said to have stormed the place, shot indiscriminately before whisking the two men away. It was learnt that scores of residents and fun seekers took to their heels when the gunmen struck. A stakeholders’ in Bonny, Alwell Brown, on Thursday gave the names of the victims as Dennis Hart and one Akwe. Brown said five other residents of Bonny who were abducted since September 2020 were still in captivity. “I am using this opportunity to call on the state government and security agencies to come to our aid to ensure that the now seven kidnapped Bonny residents are released,” he said. Calls to the spokesman for the state police command, SP Nnamdi Omoni, rang out. Omoni did not reply to a text message sent to him. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
