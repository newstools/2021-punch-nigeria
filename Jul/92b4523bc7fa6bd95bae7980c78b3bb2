Four women were on Wednesday arrested in Benin City, Edo State, for selling donkey meat, known as ‘Jaki’, to unsuspecting buyers at the New Benin Market. The Permanent Secretary of the state Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr Peter Aikhuomobhogbe, who led officials to make the arrest, said the team was alerted that some persons were engaged in the sale of the meat despite its prohibition. He stated, “This is an issue of food safety. In Edo State, donkey meat is not approved as one of the meats that we consume, but our people still indulge in its sale. We will take all necessary steps to ensure that we eradicate its consumption in Edo State. “We will continue to ensure that we pursue those involved in the business so that we will bring them to justice, because it is not right for us to provide food that is not healthy for our people.” On his part, the Assistant Director, Department of Veterinary Public Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr Peter Osagie, stated, “Donkey meat is not part of the meat legislated for human consumption in Edo State; the traders do this business under the cover of darkness and secrecy.” The Chairman, Association of Edo State Practicing Butchers, Akhere Odijie, noted that the donkey meat was being brought into Benin City from Agbor in Delta State.
