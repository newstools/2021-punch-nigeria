The Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, has ordered the commencement of computer-based tests for fresh applicants of the national driver’s license. This was contained in a statement released on Thursday titled, ‘Creating a safer road use culture and enhancing the integrity of the national driver’s license: FRSC commences computer based test for applicants.’ The statement reads, “In another great move towards enhancing the integrity of the National Drivers license through the Driving School Standardisation Programme eliminating all incidences of road traffic crashes resulting from bad road use culture, the Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi has ordered the commencement of Computer Based Test (CBT) for fresh applicants of the National Drivers License in all the Driving Schools nationwide effective from 1 June, 2021. “This is contained in a statement issued by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, who revealed that the introduction of the Computer Based Test is to ensure conformity with globally acceptable standards on drivers training, and the urgent need to tackle high level of road traffic crashes occurring as a result of human factors; since these factors contribute more than 75% of road traffic crashes in Nigeria.” The statement quoted Kazeem as saying, “A total of 35 multi-choice questions are to be answered within a duration of 30 minutes and applicants must be able to score 60% and above to secure a pass mark that will guarantee the issuance of their driving certificates. Failure to secure the pass mark will lead to rewriting the test 7 days after”. “Oyeyemi therefore called on the various State Governments to expedite action by ensuring that the State Motor Licensing Authorities key into this life saving programme as Driving Schools have been mandated to ensure compliance with immediate effect. He also advised State Governments to ensure CBT is compulsory for all applicants before driving tests are done,” the statement revealed.
