The Special Adviser to the Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade on Cocoa Development and Control, Oscar Ofuka, who was arrested on Tuesday in Calabar has been taken to Lagos. The state Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo confirmed this on Thursday evening. According to her, “They (police) have taken him to Lagos. They came for what the police call investigation activities. They came for him based on a petition against him.” The PPRO blamed the initial botched arrest which was mistaken for abduction by gunmen. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Ofuka was prevented from being taken out of Calabar on Tuesday owing to the commando-style he was arrested at the premises of the Cross River Broadcasting Corporation where he was scheduled to begin the distribution of cocoa seedling to farmers in the Southern Senatorial District of the state. Some workers of the media corporation where Ofuka was arrested tried to prevent the arrest on Tuesday but were threatened by the gun-wielding policemen who sped off with the victim in a red Ford pickup truck. The intervention by the state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande led to the interception of the policemen at Jonathan Bypass as they were speeding away with Ofuka. They were brought back to the Command probably for proper documentation before he was eventually moved to Lagos.
