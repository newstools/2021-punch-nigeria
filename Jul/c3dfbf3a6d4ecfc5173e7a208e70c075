Immediate past governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, has canvassed for narrowing of the number of governorship aspirants jostling for the State’s 2023 governorship ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party. He specifically advised the political actors to narrow the number of aspirants seeking to fly the party’s flag from Delta Central to help reduce confusion ahead of the 2023 governorship election in the state. He also cautioned the gladiators to avoid comments and actions capable of scuttling the relative peace in the state ahead of the 2023 governorship election in the state. Uduaghan gave the exhortations on Sunday when PDP leaders from Urhobo ethnic nationality under the auspices of Delta Central 2023 paid him and PDP leaders from Itsekiri ethnic nationality, a consultative visit in Warri. He said, “We used the G3 platform to narrow candidates for the governorship to one person who flew our senatorial flag. “I will advise that you borrow our template. Narrow the aspirants to one person otherwise it will create a lot of confusion. “I want to commend you for using words that are endearing and conciliatory to make your request. Continue on this path as you go round to solicit support.” Earlier, the Chairman of Delta Central 2023, Chief Ighoyota Amori, commended former Governor Uduaghan and Itsekiri PDP leaders for receiving the group. Amori said, “We don’t have a problem with our Ijaw brothers or any other ethnic group contesting for Governor as they have been contesting in every election.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
