Policy makers should adopt the strategic PR tools of trust building and dialogue as a veritable tool for solving the insecurity challenges in Nigeria. This was the position of Lagos Chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations in commemoration of the World PR Day on Friday. According to a statement by the chapter, Lagos NIPR believes that the right application of the tactics and components of the profession will promote dialogue and trust among the different warring factions in the country. The statement said the application of trust and dialogue would help to reduce prejudice and build up mutual confidence to reduce agitation and create a more peaceful society. The Lagos chapter said by establishing channels for dialogue in times of crisis, the pains of victims would be soothed, tensions lessened and there would be amicable resolutions of disagreements among the different stakeholders in the country. The statement called on all policy makers at all levels of government to prioritise the need to engage certified public relations professionals to lead their communication and dialogue efforts.
