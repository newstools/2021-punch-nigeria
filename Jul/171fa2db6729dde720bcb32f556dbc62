Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Katsina State, on Saturday, declared that the North Central part of Nigeria should produce the next  president in 2023. The PDP members, who were led by a party leader in the state, Abubakar Adamu, declared their support for a former Senate President, Abubakar Saraki, to be president in 2023. Adamu, who spoke on behalf of the party members, said Saraki had the wherewithal to lead Nigeria, citing his performance as a two-term governor of Kwara State and Senate President. He stated, “It is an open secret that we currently have security challenges in Nigeria. So, we need someone who can secure Nigeria for the sake of the future of our youths. In addition, If you consider the votes the PDP got in the 2019 election, for instance, it clearly showed that the North Central is owned by the PDP because the votes we got there were more than two million. “But, in the North-East, where the PDP presidential candidate came from in 2019, we only had 800,000 votes. That shows that if PDP decides to pick the presidential candidate from the North Central, it can win the election.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
