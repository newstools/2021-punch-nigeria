The Gombe State Police Command has arrested two suspects for buying and selling adulterated fertiliser in Gombe, the state capital. This was contained in a statement issued by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Mary Malum, in Gombe on Friday. Malum said the arrest was made on July 4 by police detectives attached to the State Criminal Investigation Department that acted on credible intelligence. She said the suspects were “one Ibrahim Salisu, 26 years from Marke village, Kankara LGA, Katsina State and one Maina Bukar, 46 years from Biu LGA, Borno State, who is the buyer here in Gombe State”. The PRO said the suspects confessed to have been in “this dirty and unlawful business where the said Ibrahim Salisu who is the supplier brings the unbranded and misbranded fertiliser” and adulterate it with sand. She said that the command had recovered as exhibits all 600 bags of the fertiliser, adding that the products had been sent to the Ministry of Agriculture Gombe State for authentication and laboratory analysis. Malum added that both suspects would be “subsequently charged to Court for prosecution”. She, therefore, warned all individuals or groups involved in such nefarious activity to desist, while assuring the people of Gombe State of the command’s readiness to protect lives and properties.
