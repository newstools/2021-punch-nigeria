Jigawa State Governor, Badaru Abubakar, has expressed sadness over the death of former Military Administrator of the state, Brigadier General Ibrahim Aliyu (rtd) who died on Friday in Kaduna. Aliyu was the Military Administrator of Jigawa State from December 1993 to August 1996 during the military regime of the late General Sani Abacha. A statement issued by Habibu Nuhu Kila, Special Adviser, Media and Public Relations to the Governor on Saturday, said Badaru described the death of Aliyu as a great loss to the people and Government of Jigawa State, noting that, the late General sacrificed his life in the service of humanity. The statement recalled that early this month the Vice President Yemi Osibanjo was in Jigawa state to commissioned a road named after Aliyu as part of the recognition of his contribution to the state. “Governor Badaru pray to the Almighty Allah to grant him eternal rest and condole his family and people of Jigawa State the fortitude to bear the loss,” the statement said.
