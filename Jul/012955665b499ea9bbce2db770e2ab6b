The Accident Investigation Bureau’s recent report on Hawker Siddeley’s accident at the Port Harcourt airport showed that the runway headlights were unserviceable at the time of the accident in 2015. Speaking on the report of the accident at a press conference via zoom on Thursday, the AIB Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Akin Olateru, spoke on the accident involving a Hawker Siddeley HS-125-800 XP aircraft owned and operated by SWAT Technology Limited. He said the investigation identified the causal factor was a black hole effect disorientation causing low-level manoeuvre into grass verges. The AIB also released reports on other incidents.
