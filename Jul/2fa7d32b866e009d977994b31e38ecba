A new graduate of Law, Chioma Jane, is celebrating her father, who was also her classmate for five years. In an appreciation post on Twitter, Jane shared her experience, while thanking her father for his efforts on her. She said that anytime, her father was asked a question in class, he would, first of all, introduce her as his daughter and that he never missed classes unless it was unavoidable. Jane tweeted, “Then I became the girl whose dad was in her class. This man would leave work and come to class every day. If I’m a minute late, I’m in trouble. He saw my results before me, he pays my fees first before his. So many stories to tell, or how he fell sick and couldn’t walk for days, or how he stood by me when I thought I’d be suspended from school. God, thank you for my daddy. This man is proud of me! And I am proud of him!” On some of the privileges she got, Jane said that her father got her a car, even though her house was five minutes from her school and the car was mostly parked in front of the hostel. One of the quirks of their father-daughter relationship was that she must greet him every morning when she comes to class. Jane said, “I must greet him every morning when I come to class. Mehnn! I hear of people having their parents in their school with them but not the same class. And I did it for 5 years. Kept at it for 5 years! God, I was so angry sometimes. “If you’re in my school you’d understand, boys couldn’t even talk to me! The man was a force to contend with! How did I even do it?” “The special treatment I got because of him. His presence gave me grace. Daddy and daughter are barristers!!!DADDY!,” she added. About the school fees, Jane said, “And should I mention that it’s a private uni for the fees were over the roof? Paying over 1m twice and I never owed a dime!! I never lacked a thing. He never made me feel the pressure. God, I have no words to thank you.”
