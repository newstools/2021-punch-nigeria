The Federal High Court in Lagos has discharged a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Paul Usoro (SAN), of the N1.4bn money laundering charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Justice Rilwan Aikawa made the decision on Friday while ruling on Usoro’s no-case submission. According to the judge, the anti-graft agency failed to establish any prima facie case against Usoro which would warrant him to enter a defence. The EFCC had in the charges alleged that Usoro, in connivance with others, converted N1.4bn belonging to the Akwa Ibom State Government and laundered same. In an attempt to prove the charges, the EFCC called two witnesses and tendered documents. But after the prosecution closed its case, rather than enter defence of the allegations, Usoro, through his legal team led by Offiong Offiong (SAN), filed a no-case submission, contending that the anti-graft failed to establish a prima facie case against him. Ruling on Friday, Justice Aikawa said, “On the whole, I hold that the prosecution has failed to establish any prima facie case. Accordingly, the defendant is hereby discharged.” Copyright PUNCH.
