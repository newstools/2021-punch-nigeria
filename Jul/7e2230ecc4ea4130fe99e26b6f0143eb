The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra said it has concluded plans to drag the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to the International Criminal Court of Justice over what it described as systematic annihilation of pro-Biafra agitators in Nigeria. MASSOB, in a statement on Sunday signed by its National Director of Information, Comrade Edeson Samuel, however, appealed to the United Nations, African Union, United States of America, G8 Nations and International Human Rights Organizations to intervene and save the Indigenous People of Biafra. It said the “atrocious acts of the Nigerian government” had led to the killings, unlawful arrest, abductions, torture and detention of hundreds of innocent Biafra agitators, including Nnamdi Kanu. In the statement titled, ‘Save Biafrans From Annihilation’, the group stated, “We wish to inform the people of Biafra that MASSOB has finalized plans through our legal team to sue Major General Mohammadu Buhari led Nigerian government to the international criminal court of Justice, Hague. “MASSOB warned that nothing harmful will ever happen to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Sunday Igboho and other Biafra/ Oduduwa freedom agitators that have been held, tortured, starved and denied medical attention.”
