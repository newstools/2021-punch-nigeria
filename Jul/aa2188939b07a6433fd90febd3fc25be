THE Nigeria Basketball Federation has described the decision of FIBA to stop Nneka Ogwumike and Elizabeth Williams from playing for D’Tigress at the Tokyo 2020 OlympicGames as discriminatory. The federation, in a tweet on its Twitter page on Monday, described the move as “repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience.” They accused the world body of approving African players to play for other countries, but denied both players the chance to represent their country of birth. “We do tacitly believe that there are undercurrents and motivation for such a decision, which is repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience. “It is also discriminatory because players of African descent are approved to play for other countries constantly but the reverse is not the case,” NBBF wrote on Twitter. D’Tigress coach Otis Hughley Jr. also called on FIBA to help basketball grow in Nigeria and Africa by allowing the duo to play for Nigeria. “Allow them the opportunity to help grow the game,” Hughley said after D’Tigress 93-62 loss to the USA on Sunday. “That continent would just be turned on its head for basketball in a good way. You have no idea how many lives would be impacted and changed for the ages. “They didn’t anticipate us being in that position. So there are some things going on that nobody sees and nobody talks about. It gets in the way of integrity. It’s gonna catch up with whoever’s doing that. It’s just dead wrong. I know FIBA is better than that. I’ve been part of them a long time; it’s a great organization.” PUNCH Sports Extra reported on Monday that Ogwumike and Williams have appealed FIBA’s rejection at the Court of Arbitration for Sports.
