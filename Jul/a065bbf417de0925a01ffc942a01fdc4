The International Air Transport Association has announced the appointment of Brendan Sullivan as its global head of cargo. According to IATA, Sullivan has worked in air cargo for 20 years including spending 14 years at IATA. It said since January, he had been acting global head of cargo alongside his role as head of cargo operations and e-commerce. Sullivan began his career in air cargo at Air Canada in 2000, where he gained frontline operational experience and developed expertise in dangerous goods handling that facilitated his transition to IATA in 2007, the statement said. The IATA’s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security, Nick Careen, said, “Brendan will be a great Global Head of Air Cargo. He knows the industry from frontline operations to the development of global standards. “He recognises the critical need for modernisation to meet the needs of air cargo’s biggest business opportunities — e-commerce and special cargo. And he has the passion to drive a post-crisis agenda that will strengthen air cargo’s contribution to the global economy and to the airline business.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
