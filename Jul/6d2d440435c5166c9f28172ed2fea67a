Team Nigeria contingent to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics appeared in uniform kits for the first time on Saturday, days after arriving Kisarazu, Japan, venue of their pre-Olympics training camp. This comes after Saturday PUNCH’s report that the contingent had on different attires despite AFA Sports being named the country’s official kits supplier for the Olympics. According to the report, the athletes and officials wore different attires on their arrival in Japan, with one of them putting on an Arsenal jersey during the visit of the Nigerian Ambassador to Japan, Abubakar Moriki, to the team’s camp. After the report, pictures of the contingent in green T-shirts with Nigeria inscribed on it, and black shorts flooded social media platforms Saturday morning – the first time the team were uniformly dressed. The pictures had 21 athletes and officials. A top official of the ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told SUNDAY PUNCH that the kits for the entire contingent were already disbursed to members of the contingent. He added that sports minister Sunday Dare had put in place everything needed to ensure Team Nigeria won medals at the global sports showpiece. “We (ministry) wanted a full picture of the 58 athletes (representing Nigeria) at once. “The minister has been dealing with the logistics of settling the athletes down.  They have a perfect and one of the best pre-Games camp in Kisarazu, top-notch catering and feeding. Also, quality kits have been handed over directly to the athletes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
