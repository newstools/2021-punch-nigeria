Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has vowed to never betray the trust bestowed on him by the electorate. He said the success records of his administration were manifestations of the fact that God had honoured the state, adding that he would never compromise the interest of the state for any political advantage. Wike stated this during the opening of the 5.33km Ogu-Ekporo-Kpogor-Wakama Link Road at Tende Ama and Ogu in the Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area on Friday, according to a statement titled ‘I can’t betray Rivers interest/electorates –Gov Wike’ by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri. The governor disclosed that several people had approached him but that he had vowed never to compromise the interest of the people of Rivers for personal political gain. He acknowledged the doggedness of Ogu and Okrika women in resisting the military from rigging the 2019 election, saying God had also disappointed those who foisted several election reruns on the state. Wike stated that he would remain eternally grateful to the women of both communities who steadfastly risked their lives and thwarted compromised soldiers’ attempts to truncate the mandate of Rivers people. He said, “This is one of the local governments that was very strong for me. During the last 2019 election, it was historic, it is like the Aba women’s riots. “It was here that the women’s revolution started as against the military that wanted to rig us out in that election. Each time I remember, I say, ‘God, thank you for using these women.’ “So, I want all Rivers people to be firm and walk with their shoulders held high. We are not second-class citizens in this country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
