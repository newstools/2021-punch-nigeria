The Osun State Government on Friday reopened the Inisa Town Central Mosque, following the ongoing peaceful resolution of the Imam-selection crisis that plagued the community. The government had in May ordered an indefinite closure of the Mosque to prevent the possibilities of an intra-religious or communal crisis trailing the Town’s inability to choose its substantive Imam. However, in a statement signed by Prince Abdullah Binuyo, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor, “With this new directive, worshippers can now congregate at the Mosque for their Juma’at and Eid prayers. “The government hopes that the community will justify the confidence reposed in it, to allow peace to continue to reign.” Recall that Eesa of Inisa town, Chief Enoch Ajiboso, took ill and died last December while presiding over a peace meeting at the palace of Olunisa of Inisa, between groups involved in a tussle for the post of Chief Imam of the town.
