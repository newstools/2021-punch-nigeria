An up-and-coming artiste, Kayode Taiwo, aka Richkjtmusic, has said that his music revolves around real-life situations. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, “I’m an American rapper and singer living in Nigeria with my mum. I grew up in Canada and Nigeria. I am also a graphic designer and digital creator. My audience is mostly Nigerians and Americans online. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been hard doing shows in Lagos and elsewhere. However, I want to explore all genres of music, including trap music. “My songs are about real-life experiences. One of my songs titled, Sad Valentines, is about not having a girlfriend. Another song, Sad Christmas, was about a lonely holiday period when my mum was detained. Flip the Switch and Hating on a Man are about the haters and ignoring them. My Extended Play album is titled KidJustTrying, and it matches my names— Kayode Joshua Taiwo.” Richkjtmusic, who is a son to controversial journalist, Kemi Olulonyo,  also noted that his mother had been helpful to his music career. He said, “I go to assignments and interviews, including concerts with my mum. My songs are inspired by singers such as Bryson Tiller, Jay Z, Kanye West, Drake, Wizkid, Davido and Burnaboy. I want to explore all genres of music.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
