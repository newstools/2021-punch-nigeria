In this episode of So This Happened, we review the recent kidnapping of the Bethel school students who were abducted in Kaduna state. The most shocking thing is that the kidnappers were reported to have demanded foodstuffs from the school to cater for the children. Still, on the issue of Bandits, some youths in Katsina state have devised ways in which we can combat armed bandits using the catapult. Lastly, Former finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun has been vindicated after a Federal High Court in Abuja ruled that a National Youth Service Corps certificate is not mandatory for appointment into political office in the country.
