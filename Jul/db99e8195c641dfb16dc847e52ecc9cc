The Lagos State Government has relocated the burnt Igbosere High Court by to a new temporary complex at Osborne, Ikoyi. Recall that Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu had promised to relocate the court, which was burnt in October 2020 during the #EndSARS protest. The State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo, said the new complex was temporary, as the  Igbosere court complex would soon be rebuild. He said, “The temporary court complex consists of eight court rooms with equal number of judges’ chambers, secretary’s office, registrar’s office, general office for administrative staff, restrooms on each floor, canteen, litigants’ room, and an office for the Chief Judge. “The new temporary court complex is equipped with the latest technology to enhance digital recording of court proceedings.” While receiving the new temporary court complex, the Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Kazeem Alogba, commended Sanwo-Olu for providing a replacement. He said, “The edifice will be a relief to the judges whose property got burnt during the #EndSARS protest which was quite traumatic because they are used to working and not being idle for a long period of time.” Copyright PUNCH.
