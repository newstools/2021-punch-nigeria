The US Consulate General in Lagos and Ascend Studios Foundation have partnered to implement the 2021 Academy for Women Entrepreneurs, an initiative that supports women entrepreneurs around the world. According to a statement by the organisation, 200 participants will be selected from the 17 states of southern Nigeria for the 2021 cohort. Participants who graduate from the AWE would gain automatic membership to the US government exchange alumni community, the statement said. It added, “Women’s meaningful economic participation is integral to achieving greater security and stability around the world. “The AWE initiative is a great opportunity for Nigerian women entrepreneurs to gain university-level business and management training, strengthen their networks, and grow sustainable businesses.” The US Consulate Public Affairs Officer, Stephen Ibelli, said, “Women have a key role to play in Nigeria’s future prosperity. “As we have seen time and time again, when women do better, countries do better, communities do better, and families do better.” Chief Executive Officer of Ascend Studios Foundation, Ms Inya Lawal, said, “We are delighted that the US Consulate General in Lagos has partnered with us to implement this programme, the largest yet. “AWE is a transformative initiative that is helping women in Nigeria build and sustain their businesses; the opportunities that come from this programme are immense.” It stated that female entrepreneurs interested in participating in the AWE programme could apply at no cost by filling out the application form on its website.
