The Sultan, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar-led Jama’atu Nasril Islam has described as “unfortunate” the continued wave insecurity occasioned by banditry, kidnapping and insurgency across some parts of the north. The JNI noted that the continued insecurity across the North without any solution was condemnable, calling on Nigerians to provide intelligence tips to security operatives to end the security challenges. The Muslim body stated this in a statement by the JNI’s Secretary General, Dr Abubakar  Khalid-Aliyu, titled, ‘Press release on the first 19 days of Dhul-hijjah 1442AH(2021) and the need for sustained prayers and virtuous acts of devotions,’ on Monday. It reads partly, “Jama’atu Nasril Islam under the leadership of His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar,the Sultan of Sokoto, urges the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to be more dedicated and be committed in virtuous acts during these days which have commenced yesterday, Sunday, July 11, 2021. “We therefore use this occasion to call on the Muslim Ummah to imbibe the spirit of forgiveness and shun acts that will attract the anger of Allah (SWT). “We should all be more generous in alms and should also seriously engage in supplications for an end to the myriad of challenges bedevilling the Nigerian nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
