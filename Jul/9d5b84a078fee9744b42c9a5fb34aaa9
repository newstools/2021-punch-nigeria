The Governor of Kwara State, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said that the state is set to establish an education trust fund to mobilise resources for school infrastructure and provide affordable and qualitative education. This was disclosed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, in a statement titled, ‘Why we’re setting up Kwara Education Trust Fund: AbdulRazaq’. The Governor spoke about the fund while attending the inauguration of a multimillion naira information communication technology centre and a central administrative block donated to the Ansaru-ud-Deen College Ijagbo by Prince Lateef Fagbemi (SAN). “Our administration recognises the limitations of government to shoulder the burden of infrastructural development in all local government areas of the state. That is why we have sent Kwara State Education Trust Fund Bill to the House of Assembly. When passed into law, it will ensure contributions into schools,” the statement quoted AbdulRazaq as saying. He added, “The law will empower the state government to partner with philanthropists, foundations and corporate bodies to raise money and help support strengthening educational infrastructure in the state.” The Governor also commended Fagbemi for his contribution to the college, saying the gesture represents a major boost for human capital development in Kwara State. “Let me commend Lateef Fagbemi’s effort in this community. This is a huge development. What else can you give to your community better than solid education? We are very grateful for this. You are not just the pride of the community, you’re an ambassador of the state. We appreciate your efforts,” AbdulRazaq said.
