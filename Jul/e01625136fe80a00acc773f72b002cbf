Binance has burnt about $390m worth of Binance Coin in its 16th quarterly token burn event. The company announced that it had destroyed 1,296,728 BNB tokens valued at around $400m at the time. In a tweet, the Chief Executive Officer of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, said, “In summary 1,296,728 BNB ($390,855,150) burned by Binance. “The remaining 16m BNB unlocked, and moved to a team address, according to the schedule in the white paper. Binance team has never used or sold a single team BNB thus far, only burned them.” The exchange said that an additional 5,163 BNB had since been destroyed through its Pioneer Burn Program. This program is an incentive that helps users who have lost tokens through honest mistaken transactions to smart contracts. According to Cointelegraph, Binance has pledged to burn 20 per cent of its profits quarterly, with the latest burn suggesting that the exchange could have profited by $2bn during Q2 of 2021. This latest burn is the second-largest in Binance Coin’s history by fiat value, after it destroyed $600m worth of BNB in March. According to Investopedia, coin burning is the process by which digital currency miners and developers can remove tokens or coins from circulation, thereby slowing down inflation rates or reducing the total circulating supply of coins. In simple terms, burning a coin, refers to sending an otherwise usable token to an unusable account. The act of burning effectively removes tokens from the available supply, increasing its relative scarcity. Last Friday, Binance halted the sale of its stock tokens. Copyright PUNCH.
