THE Ekiti State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Wednesday denied allegations that it shut out supporters of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, from its stakeholders’ meeting held in Ado Ekiti, last Friday. Public Relations Officer, of the party in the state, Ade Ajayi, said, “All efforts were taken to ensure notice of the meeting reached every concerned person, including placement of the adverts in national dailies, broadcast of jingles on radio stations and posting of posters at the state party secretariat and branches across the state.” National Coordinator of South West Agenda for 2023, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, had alleged that members of the group who are Tinubu’s loyalists were being ostracized. However, Ajayi, in a statement titled, ‘Re: Ekiti APC Stakeholders parley – Stop lying, you were well informed’, stated, “They claimed that the party leadership in the state excluded certain people from the meeting and that they were not carried along. These are blatant lies. “We encourage those bent on causing divisions among us to stop lying – you were all notified of the meeting, like everyone else. You are all invited to join the rest of us in the ship of unity and progress. As Ekiti people, that is the honourable thing to do. “We cannot force anyone to drink from the fount of peace and reconciliation that is flowing freely among members of the party in the state. As a party, we shall do all within our power to encourage all members to participate in genuine efforts to reconcile all parties and build one big and united family. Copyright PUNCH.
