The case instituted by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project against the Federal Government over recovered Abacha’s loot, could not continue at the Federal High Court Abuja on Thursday, due to the absence of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN). Justice Taiwo Taiwo adjourned the matter to July 27 and issued a hearing notice to be served on the AGF. SERAP had sued the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, and the AGF as first and second defendants respectively. In the suit, SERAP prayed the court to compel the Federal Government to disclose the exact amount recovered from Abacha’s loot and also the details of projects executed with the recovered loot. SERAP’s lawyer, Opeyemi Owolabi, informed the court that he had a motion on notice seeking to apply for an order of mandamus against the defendants. Owolabi told the court that he had earlier brought the motion ex parte but was directed by the court to put all the parties on notice. He also informed the court that he has now served the parties. The lawyer to the Minister of Finance, Abdulamin Ibrahim, informed the court that they have also filed their processes accordingly. However, the AGF was absent neither was he represented in court. Consequently, SERAP’s lawyer applied for an adjournment. He also applied for a hearing notice to be issued and served on the AGF. The matter was coming up for the first time after the strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria.
