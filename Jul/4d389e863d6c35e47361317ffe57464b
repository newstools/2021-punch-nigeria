Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested five suspected kidnappers while the gang attempted collecting N3.5m ransom for an eight-year-old boy, Sadiq Abass. The police identified the suspects as Abdul-Raman Umar, Falalu Abubakar, Danjuma Bako,  Idris Lawal and Fauziya Falalu . The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. Oyeyemi said the suspects were arrested on Friday following a complaint lodged at the Ogere divisional police headquarters by the victim’s father, Riliwan Mohammed. The PPRO said the five suspects conspired to kidnap and collect N3.5m from Mohammed. He said, “The suspects were arrested following a complaint lodged at the Ogere divisional headquarters by one Riliwan Mohammed, who reported that he left his wife and three children at home at about 12 noon, only for him to receive a phone call from a strange number that his eight years old son had been abducted. “He reported further that the caller demanded N3.5m as ransom if he wanted to see the boy alive. “Upon the report, the DPO, Ogere division, CSP Abiodun Ayinde, quickly mobilised his crack detectives to go after the hoodlums. “The detectives embarked on technical and intelligence-based investigation, which led them to the hideout of the suspects, where they were arrested and the victim rescued unhurt.” Oyeyemi said the state Commissioner of Police, Edward  Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the anti-kidnapping unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation.
