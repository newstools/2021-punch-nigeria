The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has threatened to depose any monarch and community development committee leaders that attempt to extort money from companies handling government infrastructural projects. He issued the warning during the flag-off of the construction of the Rumuepirikom Flyover in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state on Wednesday. The governor stated that “any monarch from Rumuepirikom and other communities in the state who summoned contractors handling government projects to his palace for the purpose of demanding inducement will be deposed.” The governor’s threat was contained in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, titled, ‘Rivers State Government will depose chiefs, CDC leadership that harass contractors, disrupt government projects.’ He also warned youths in the state to “resist the temptation of disrupting government projects communities,” saying the era when government winked at such acts was over. The governor also advised Julius Berger and other companies handling construction works to ensure implementation of the local content component of the project. “Now, I’ll not be a governor that will go and meet somebody in 2023 when I leave to complete my village road, no, I won’t do that. Every road in my community, I must do it now. I am not forgetting any road,” Wike said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
