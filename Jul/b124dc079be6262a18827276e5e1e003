Former Flying Eagles midfielder, Nnamdi Ofoborh, has completed his move to Scottish champions, Glasgow Rangers, from AFC Bournemouth, The PUNCH reports. The 21-year-old signed a four-year pre-contract with the Gers in February, after rejecting a contract extension with the Cherries, where he made just five senior appearances. Ofoborh spent last season on-loan at League One Wycombe Wanderers, where he made 25 appearances in what was a truncated season, scoring twice. His spell at Adams Park saw him help the Chairboys win promotion to the Championship through the play-offs, with Ofoborh playing his part in the Wembley final. The former Tottenham youth player took to Instagram to thank his former club and also express his readiness for a new start with Rangers. “As this chapter in my life closes, I just want to thank AFC Bournemouth for taking me in at 16 and helping me grow into the player I am today,” he wrote. “Teammates who have turned into brothers. I wouldn’t change it for nothing. Thank you. Thank God, I can’t wait for this next chapter, let’s go!” Speaking on his arrival, Rangers Sporting Director, Ross Wilson, said, “We look forward to welcoming Nnamdi to our group in the summer. We are extremely impressed by his qualities and he is a player that has real progression in him. “He has a positive and determined personality and is very much looking forward to becoming a Rangers player.”
