Akwa United extended their lead at the top of the Nigeria Professional Football League table with a 1-0 win over title contenders Enyimba to go five points clear of second-placed Nasarawa United with six games to the end of the season. Charles Atshimene scored the only goal of the encounter from the penalty spot in the 89th minute as the Promise Keepers moved closer to winning their first domestic league title in their 25-year history. Akwa play third-placed Rivers United, who defeated Warri Wolves in their match-day 33 fixture in Port Harcourt, next Sunday with the Uyo side’s coach, Kennedy Boboye, hopeful they can get a meaningful result. “We played against a very strong and tactical team, but kudos goes to the players, they fought hard for the three points,” Boboye said after the match. “It’s just for us to take it one game at a time, this one (against Enyimba) is done and dusted and our next target is to go to Port Harcourt and fight to get something, and we need to achieve that if we want to become champions.” In other results, relegation-threatened Sunshine Stars continued their fairytale run with a 1-0 win over Kano Pillars, their third straight win in as many matches. River United moved closer to picking a continental ticket with a 2-1 win over Warri Wolves. Dakkada FC, Jigawa Golden Stars and Lobi Stars pipped Heartland, Plateau United and Adamawa United 1-0 respectively. Enugu Rangers, FC IfeanyiUbah and Abia Warriors beat Wikki Tourists, Nasarawa United and Kwara United 2-1 respectively, while MFM played a goalless draw against Katsina United in Lagos.
