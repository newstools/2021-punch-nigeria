An FCT High Court, sitting in Kubwa, on Tuesday, ordered a 21- year-old student, Abraham Umuibe, who cheated a Chinese woman of N113,000, to sweep Mpape Government Secondary School for 90 days. Delivering the judgment, Justice Kezziah Ogbonnaya said the court had been enjoined to give non-custodial sentencing geared towards decongestion of the prisons, depending on the case; adding that the parties entered a plea bargain. Ogbonnaya ordered the prison officers to provide a register for Umuibe to sign in daily for the 90 days, after which he would be free to go home. She warned him to desist from committing crimes and to be of good behaviour. Earlier, the defence counsel, Ruth Mamza, had prayed the court to temper justice with mercy, adding that the defendant was a firs-time offender, with no criminal record. According to Mamza, he is remorseful and understood the gravity of his offence. “The defendant has repented and refunded everything he collected from the crime,’’ Mamza said. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the prosecuting counsel, Ijeabalum Diribe, told the court that Umuibe and his defence counsel had entered and signed a plea bargain on June 16. Diribe urged the court to sentence and convict Umuibe in line with the terms of the plea bargain entered, which states that upon conviction, the defendant should pay N113,000 fine or one month in prison. The EFCC charged Umuibe with cheating and falsely representing himself as a Chinese citizen and military man named Maisbay Chang. The prosecuting counsel said Umuibe fraudulently induced a Chinese lady on We Chat and collected N113,000 from her. She said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 95 of the Penal Code.
