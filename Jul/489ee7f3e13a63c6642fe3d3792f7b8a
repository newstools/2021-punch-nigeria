Italy and Spain meet in a blockbuster first semi-final at Euro 2020 before an expected crowd of 60,000 at Wembley on Tuesday as anticipation builds ahead of host nation England’s last-four tie against Denmark. Tuesday’s game is the latest episode in a burgeoning rivalry between Italy and Spain with the nations meeting in a fourth consecutive European Championship. Spain won on penalties in the quarter-finals in Vienna in 2008 on their way to winning the trophy and then thrashed Italy 4-0 in the final in Kiev four years later. Italy gained a measure of revenge by winning 2-0 in the last 16 at Euro 2016 and the Azzurri appear the favourites this time as they arrive at Wembley having knocked out Belgium in the quarter-finals to stretch their unbeaten run to a remarkable 32 games. “We know that if we play the way we have in the last 30 matches or so then we can come away with a good result,” said Italy’s defensive stalwart Leonardo Bonucci on Monday. While Italy — whose only European Championship title came in 1968 — have been the standout team at the tournament so far, Spain have overcome a difficult start to reach the last four as they target a record fourth continental crown. Luis Enrique’s team beat Croatia 5-3 in extra time in the first knockout round before edging Switzerland on penalties in the last eight. “We simply need to be motivated by the fact we are coming up against such a great and prestigious side in such a wonderful arena as Wembley, in the knowledge that we could be involved in the final in just a few days’ time,” added Bonucci. Both Italy coach Roberto Mancini and Luis Enrique expressed regret that supporters of the two semi-finalists will not be able to travel to attend the game in London.
