Popular Nigerian entertainer, Denrele Edun, has revealed that he does not get enough credit for his work. He made this known on Thursday via his verified Instagram page where he shared a recent photo of himself. Describing the picture, he wrote, “Not a throwback. This is a real authentic Living-Life-On-His-Own-Terms NonConforming Unproblematic 40 Year Old!” He went further to share how he started out and changed the narrative. “Started out in 1993 and I sincerely don’t get enough credit for my Portfolio of Work. Singlehandedly made a long list of A-list Stars, changed the narrative, sparked off conversations around the world (Heck, I was recently a ‘Case Study’ for a course at the Warwick Business School in London) and many more I don’t even bother to mention,” Denrele said. He continued, “Sha don’t come and rubbish my craftsmanship…Feel free to diss my personae (I’m a sweet soul!). “Oh, and a popular cross dresser scuttled out of a building the moment they heard I was around. Start to fear! ‘Cause I’m putting my karate to good use now. Keep my name outta your mouth!” (sic) As a popular entertainer in the Nigerian space, Denrele has delved into various artistic ventures including cross dressing, event hosting, acting, and a host of others.
