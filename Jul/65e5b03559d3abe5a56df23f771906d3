Nigerians on social media have reacted to a GoFundMe account set up for embattled actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, also known as Baba Ijesha, who is standing trial for alleged sexual assault of a minor. As the court case continues, some friends and fans of the thespian had created a GoFundMe account to help him to cover his legal fees. The fundraiser, with a target of €50,000, (over N20m) titled, ‘Help Olanrewaju Omiyinka with Legal Costs,’ was organised by Oladele Matti, who resides in Dublin, Ireland. However, the opening of the GoFundMe account did not go down well with some Nigerians on social media as they have taken to Facebook to express their disapproval. A Facebook user, Jessica Mogbo, said, “See some people supporting this act. How many sick actors or actresses have they raised funds for? Misplaced priorities.” Olatunji Amida also said, “This is a fraudulent act and must be condemned. Oladele Matti who resides in Dublin, Ireland, should know the implication of the charges leveled against Baba Ijesha. I think he has ulterior motives and personal interests in the GoFundMe proceeds! This is absolutely a misplaced priority.” Tajudeen Buhari said, “They … can’t raise money to empower the youths and unfortunately, many senseless graduates will still keep hailing their action. What a nation!” Describing the action as “arrant nonsense,” Ogunsola Nurudeen asked, “Why not persuade those human rights lawyers for legal assistance…?” “Same friends that bash the Nigerian government every day, why raise money for someone accused of sexual assault? With a child for that matter. Absolute lunacy… ” Lucianno Omo said.
