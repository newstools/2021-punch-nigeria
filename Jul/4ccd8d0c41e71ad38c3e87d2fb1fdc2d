According to a statement by the Group Corporate Communications and Event Manager, Dufil Prima Foods Plc, Mr Temitope Ashiwaju, the field search exercise that started from the 2nd week in July would run till the end of August. Ashiwaju said, “We strongly believe in this initiative. This is one of the ways we sow into the future of Nigeria because when you support the Nigerian child, you are invariably investing in the future of the country.” Speaking on this development, the Managing Partner and Principal Consultant, Mark Analytics & Research Services Limited, Mr Magnus Adiele, and Managing Director, BanahGrace Research Agency, Ms Abiola Olaonipekun, assured that all stories would be thoroughly verified and authenticated by way of thorough investigation and gathering of witnesses who could testify to the authenticity of the stories. Olaonipekun added, “Nothing will be spared in verifying the authenticity of the stories and we intend to ensure more quality stories are obtained this year. The search exercise will not be limited to just the eight approved locations as we intend to explore neighbouring areas within these locations for stories.” The field search exercise would last for seven weeks to give ample time for the search process to be held in eight locations spread across Nigeria, the statement added.
