A Toyota Camry has careened off the Mobolaji Bank-Anthony Way, directly opposite the Police College, Ikeja, Lagos State. Onlookers said that the accident happened in the early hours of Sunday morning, but they could not say how the driver fared. The accident, which appeared to be a lone one, featured the car which seemed to be coming from the Sheraton end of the road, and heading towards the Airport. The car plunged into the ditch by the side of the road, where there are rows of shops, artisans sheds and â€˜just a few meters away from the gate of Olowu Street. The car levelled the electric poles on its path, and high tension cables are currently strewn all over the ground. Residents currently guarded the iron cables with discarded wooden furniture.
