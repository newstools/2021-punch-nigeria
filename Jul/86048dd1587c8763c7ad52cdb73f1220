Troops have killed at least 37 ISWAP-Boko Haram terrorists in Bula Yobe, Jabullam, Yobe State, in a joint military operation by the air task force and ground troops of the Nigerian military. Similarly, airstrikes by the Nigerian Air Force attack jets destroyed dozens of terrorists’ camps in the Abadam area and the Sambisa forest. PRNigeria reported that accurate airstrikes coordinated by the Air Task Force Command destroyed the hideouts of ISWAP terrorists in Jabullam and Yauma Wango in the Abadam Local Government Area of the state and Parisu in the Sambisa forest on Wednesday. Intelligence sources said the air raids were launched after a series of aerial surveillance missions indicated massive convergence of the terrorists in standby to stage attacks. The NAF spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said in a statement, “The Nigerian Air Force jets dispatched by the ATF Command scored accurate hits on the targeted locations, obliterating and killing scores of the terrorists in the general areas. Several gun trucks and armoury of the terrorists were destroyed, while a ground assessment by sources revealed that a number of ISWAP high-value fighters were eliminated. “The operation, which was efficiently coordinated by our Air Task Force and ground troops, resulted in the neutralisation of the terrorist elements. We have also sustained aerial bombardments to rout the fleeing ISWAP-Boko Haram criminals.”
