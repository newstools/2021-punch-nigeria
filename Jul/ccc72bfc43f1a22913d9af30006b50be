The Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Works and Infrastructure, Mrs Aramide Adeyoye, has said that the Ikeja G.R.A Urban Regeneration Project would be completed within six months in order to reverse the environmental and infrastructural challenges posed by occasional flooding. This was disclosed in a statement by Adeyoye during an inspection tour of rehabilitation work on Oduduwa Way, Oduduwa Crescent, Oba Dosunmu and Sobo Arobiodu streets within the Ikeja municipality. Adeyoye explained that flooding had affected multi-billion-naira property investments in Ikeja G.R.A with many property owners failing to ensure proper drainage and water channels along their roads. She said, “In order to address and reverse flooding and infrastructural challenges, the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in 2020 awarded the reconstruction and upgrading of Oduduwa Way, Oduduwa Crescent, Oba Dosunmu and Sobo Arobiodu Streets, four strategic roads in Ikeja GRA. “Ikeja GRA was designated to have urban regeneration. For now, we are working on Oduduwa Way, Oduduwa Crescent, Oba Dosunmu and Sobo Arobiodu. This is a network of four roads totaling about five kilometres. “We are here to see the progress of work and address some of the issues along with the residents.” Copyright PUNCH.
