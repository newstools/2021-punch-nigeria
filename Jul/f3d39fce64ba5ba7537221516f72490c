Tricycle riders under the agies of Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria and Aba Tricycle Riders Integrated Welfare Association have embraced Keke Pass insurance cover in Umuahia and Aba. A statement from the Universal Insurance Company said the Chairman, ATRIWA, Umuahia Zone, Chisom John, while speaking at the launch of the product in Aba, applauded Universal Insurance Company for the initiative. He said, “The product is for the welfare of keke riders and we will accept it. A lot of our members die as a result of keke accident just because they don’t have enough to take care of hospital bill. We believe this product will go a long way to improve their lives.” The Chairman, TOAN, Umuahia Zone, Victor Nwoswgwu, described the initiative as a good development that should be applauded. According to him, the product was cheap and affordable for their members, and the health package made it better for its members. He said the association was assured that the company would do its best to keep its promise of prompt claims payment. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Universal Insurance, Mr Benedict Ujoatuonu, said the product became necessary because conventional insurance products did not take into account the peculiarities of ordinary Nigerians. He said, “Keke Pass is Keke Passenger Assurance Safety Scheme and it is intended to provide some personal accident cover for the riders and their passengers in terms of injury, death and third-party liability while riding their keke. “Beyond the unique benefits this product provides for the riders, it makes it affordable because it is cheaper. It is also very flexible. This is because we are dealing with people in the lower cadre.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
