The Lagos State House of Assembly on Wednesday held a public hearing on a proposed bill that will provide the legal framework for the regulation of organ transplantation from living or dead donors to patients in the state. According to a statement on Thursday, the hearing on the ‘Bill for a Law to Regulate Organ Harvest and Transplant’ was needed “considering the disturbing trend of illegal trafficking of human organs by unscrupulous elements.” The Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, who was represented by the Deputy Speaker, Eshinlokun Sanni, stated that the bill was important. He said, “Organ harvesting is a very important aspect of medical practice in our common bid for healthy existence. Harvested organs are what experts transplant in the treatment of those in medical need of those organs due to failure of their own organs.” Obasa noted that the regulation of organ harvest and transplant will end the unethical and dangerous practices being perpetrated by some nefarious individuals. “This bill seeks to create a system that will annihilate the bad ethics and illegalities being perpetrated by some nefarious elements, which call for concerted effort like we are seeking to make today. This bill seeks to introduce a system that will introduce structural sanctity in that aspect of medical profession,” he added. The Chairman of the Committee on Health Services, Hakeem Sokunle, said the bill would ensure that persons in need of organ transplant had access to available organs. Copyright PUNCH.
