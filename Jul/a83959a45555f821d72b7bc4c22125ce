Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, on Monday accused the Federal Government of bypassing the state government in the distribution of relief materials to the residents of the state. Ishaku stated this shortly after he inspected the areas of Jalingo that were affected by flood on Saturday. The governor, who called on the Federal Government to assist victims of the flood, however, lamented that most times relief assistance from it did not pass through the state government, a situation he described as bad procedure. He stated, “Last week, I understand that the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs was here sharing money to the people. I tried to get to the minister, but I couldn’t get her. “Generally, assistance from the Federal Government doesn’t get us in Taraba, and even when it does, it comes through some certain proxies. This is an unknown procedure. “Any help that is coming to Taraba should come through the government. We have established ways of doing things in the state. We have the State Emergency Management Agency and the ministry of Humanitarian Affairs exists in the state. “I see no reason why the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs cannot liaise with her counterpart ministry in the state in reaching out to the people.” While pledging the state government’s support to the victims of the flood, Ishaku said they would be relocated to other areas to avoid a repeat of the incident. Our correspondent reports that the flood submerged over 300 houses and washed away farmlands in Lau, Karim Lamido, Jalingo and Ibi local government areas of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
