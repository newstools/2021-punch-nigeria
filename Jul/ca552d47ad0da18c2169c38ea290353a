The Lagos State Police Command will on Monday carry out a post-mortem examination on Jumoke Oyeleke, the salesgirl who was allegedly killed by a stray bullet during the Yoruba Nation rally in Lagos on July 3. Agitators for the Yoruba Nation gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park at Ojota amid the presence of armed policemen and soldiers. Jumoke, 25, who displayed soft drinks at her boss’ shop in a compound close to the rally ground when security men chased some agitators into the premises, was hit by a stray bullet. However, the police in a statement denied killing the victim, saying she was an abandoned corpse with a wound sustained from a sharp object. But her family and witnesses said she was killed when police opened fire on protesters. Speaking with our correspondent on Sunday, a lawyer with the Femi Falana Chambers, Taiwo Olawanle, said the police would conduct an autopsy on the corpse on Monday to ascertain the cause of her death. He said, “The police will be conducting the autopsy tomorrow (Monday) and the Lagos State Government will be responsible for it. As of last week, we were told to pay money for an ambulance and the burial, but the information we got this evening (Sunday) was that the corpse would be released for autopsy and that the family would have to write a letter to the Attorney-General of Lagos State for us to get permission to bury her after the family had made preparations for the burial.” Copyright PUNCH.
