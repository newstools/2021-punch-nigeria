The Lagos State Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, on Tuesday called on Nigerians to ensure that peace reigns in the country, saying insurgency could result in poverty and underdevelopment. He said this at the Eid-el-Kabir prayer which was held at Dodan Barracks praying ground, Obalende. He said, “We must, as people, do everything to ensure that peace reigns in our country; so that everyone can live well and go about their daily activities without fear or molestation. It is our prayer that all will be resolved and peace be restored in our country. “For us as a country, we need to grow our economy. For this to happen there must be peace in our country. Insurgency brings war, poverty, and underdevelopment.” Similarly, the Chief Imam of Lagos, Sheikh Sulaiman Abou-Nolla, called on all arms of the government in the country to discharge their duties without favouritism and discrimination as they should be aware that they will be held accountable for everything they do on earth. He added, “Nigerians must also ensure peace in the country.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
