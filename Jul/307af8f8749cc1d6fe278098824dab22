A Magistrate’s Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has granted bail to a defendant, Favour Ibama, who was accused of drugging, raping and robbing female victims after luring them to hotels through social media. The Chief Magistrate, Obiageri Onugbum, granted Ibama bail following an application by the defence lawyer to amend the charges against him. Onugbum granted the defendant bail in the sum of N750,000 with two sureties in like sum. She adjourned the case till July 30 to enable the defendant to take his pleas on the amended charges. The chief magistrate had earlier ordered the female victims to appear in court to prove their cases; but none of them was present during Thursday’s proceedings. The defendant was arraigned on 15 counts bordering on rape, administering of illicit drugs, stealing, among others. Ibama, a father of four, was arrested on November 17, 2020, and later handed over to the Elekahia Police Station following a report of rape and sexual abuse of six ladies, before the case was transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department in Port Harcourt.
