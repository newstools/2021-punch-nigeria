Angel Di Maria scored in the 22nd minute to put Argentina ahead of Brazil in Sunday’s Copa America final. Brazil take on Argentina in the decider at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, with Lionel Messi and Neymar pursuing their first-ever continental crowns. Messi’s Argentina have not won the Copa since 1993, while injury meant Neymar was not part of the Brazil squad which triumphed in 2019. Brazil are chasing their 10th Copa title, while Argentina are looking to end their 28-year wait to add to their 14 continental crowns. Argentina have won five games in a row, including their semi-final victory over Colombia, and are unbeaten across their past 19 games. Brazil are undefeated in their past 13 games and have only conceded two goals at Copa America 2021
