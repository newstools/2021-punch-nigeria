Donny van de Beek is wanted by Real Madrid – and Manchester United are willing to let him go, the Daily Star reports. The midfielder joined the club from Ajax in the summer of 2020, but has found himself fallen down the pecking order behind Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba. The newspaper says an initial £2m will be offered for a Van de Beek loan, with the option to buy should he impress in Spain. Real Madrid star Raphael Varane has agreed personal terms with Manchester United ahead of a move to Old Trafford, according to reports. Arsenal have eyes on Bayer Leverkusen’s Edmond Tapsoba as an alternative to Ben White if they cannot clinch a deal with Brighton – although the centre-back would actually be more expensive than the Brighton man.
