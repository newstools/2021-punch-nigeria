The Plateau State Command of the Nigerian Correctional Service has confirmed the escape of four inmates from the Jos Custodial Centre. The Controller-in-Charge of the command, Mr Samuel Aguda, who confirmed the development to journalists on Friday in Jos, stated that the incident occurred in the small hours of Thursday. Attributing the development to negligence on the part of the personnel on duty, he said, “You are all aware of the ugly incident that happened in our major facility here in Jos. Yesterday, around 1am, four suspects, who are awaiting trial over kidnapping and armed robbery, escaped from our facility. “When I came to the scene, I realised that it was either that they duplicated the key to the cell or there was serious negligence on the part of the personnel on duty. The inmates escaped through the fence.” Aguda said the service had commenced investigation to unravel the remote and immediate causes of the incident. “Currently, the Assistant Controller General in charge of Operations is personally on the ground investigating the matter. “We have also constituted a search party who visited motor parks, markets and other places in search of the escapees, but none has been arrested yet. But I want to assure members of the public that we will soon get them,” he assured. Aguda called on Plateau residents to avail the service information that could lead to the arrest of the escaped inmates. He also assured the public that any officer and personnel of the service found wanting in the incident would be punished. Aguda said the officers on duty on the day the incident occurred had been detained within the prison yard, pending the conclusion of investigation.
