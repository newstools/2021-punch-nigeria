The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Sterling Bank Plc, Mr Abubakar Suleiman, has called on players in the private sector to provide vigorous support to the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination exercise so that more people will get vaccinated and drive a speedier reopening of the economy. He said this while addressing participants at a seminar in Lagos with the theme, ‘Closing the gap in COVID-19 vaccination’, which was organised by Sterling Bank in collaboration with the Healthcare Federation of Nigeria, Tremendoc and Helium Health, among others. Suleiman said those who would benefit significantly from the opening of the economy must pay for those who could not afford to pay to be vaccinated so that the economy could function again. He said, “The money which the government must put out is not for vaccination per se even though that is what it is buying. “It is to ensure that the economy does not go back into a lockdown with its attendant social crisis in forms of massive unemployment and security challenges. Then, suddenly we are able to find one or two billion dollars when we could not find one million dollars because we did not do the vaccination.” He added, “For Sterling Bank as a corporate, we have remained committed to the vaccination exercise by participating in every single path of the fight against COVID-19.
