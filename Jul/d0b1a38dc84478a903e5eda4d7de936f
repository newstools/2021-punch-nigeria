The Owerri branch of the Nigerian Bar Association has frowned at the way people impersonate lawyers in the state. The chairman of the Anti-Impersonation Committee of the branch, Ihediohanma Akponye, who spoke when his committee visited the state commissioner of police, Abutu Yaro, said that fake lawyers were causing huge economic loss to the state. The Senior lawyer said that NBA was unhappy at the spate of fraud ravaging the state. He said, “We have observed that Imo State is now riddled with fraud caused by persons that impersonate as lawyers. This is very disturbing to the Bar and as a Committee, we are committed to ensuring that impersonators face the wrath of the law. “The Anti impersonation committee of the NBA is determined to identify and flush out fake lawyers and unscrupulous elements who illegally engage and carry on some businesses that are the exclusive preserves of members of the legal profession thereby hurting the trust of the public and the economy of the state.” He commended the police in the state for recently arresting a fake lawyer, adding that more persons who impersonate the profession should be arrested and prosecuted. Akponye said, “It is important we say this that only those called to the Nigerian Bar are legally qualified to practice as lawyers in Nigeria. Even if you are a graduate, as long as you are not called to bar you can’t practice as a lawyer. That your spouse, father or mother is a lawyer does not also qualify one as a lawyer or to parade NBA stickers.” Those who accompanied the chairman were Ifeoma Ihesie, Peter Oduba, Eke Onyeforo, T. O.B Okey, Blaise Iwunze, E.C Onyema, and Williams Okere.
