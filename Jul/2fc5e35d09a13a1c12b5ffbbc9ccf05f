At least 45 people were killed and dozens injured Sunday when a Philippine military aircraft carrying troops crashed and burst into flames after missing the runway in the countryâ€™s south, the armed forces said. The revised death toll includes 42 military personnel who were on board the C-130 Hercules transport plane which was trying to land on Jolo island in Sulu province around midday. Three civilians also died in the crash, the armed forces said in a social media chat group. AFP
