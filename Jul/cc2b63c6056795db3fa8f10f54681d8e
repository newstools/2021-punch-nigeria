Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Wednesday, says he has confidence that Nigeria will neither experience another civil war nor break-up. The governor declared that the socio-economic challenges confronting the country will also be eventually surmounted. Abiodun spoke when he hosted the League of Imams and Alfas in the state at his Iperu country home, as part of the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. He admitted that though the country was going through a difficult time owing to insecurity and other challenges but expressed faith that Nigerians would overcome the situation in the end. The governor called on Nigerians not to give up but continue to have faith and trust in God, saying no problem is not too big for God to solve. He said, “I have a mountain-moving faith in God because He alone can do the impossible. “This country will not break into two; nothing will happen to us in this country, we will not go into civil war, the unity of this country is non-negotiable, God will give us peace in this country, He will give us rest. “As a government, we will try our best, please continue to pray for us,” he urged the clerics.” Abiodun stressed the need for Nigerians to unite and fight their common enemies as the diversity of the country remains her strength. He canvassed religious tolerance among adherents of different faiths, admonishing Nigerians to imbibe the virtues of Prophet Ibrahim who was regarded as the Father of Faith by having absolute trust and faith in God.
