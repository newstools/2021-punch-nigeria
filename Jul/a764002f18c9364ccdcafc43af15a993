Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said he will not support anyone, who does not have the vision and clarity of mind to make the state to progress, to succeed him in 2023. The governor said he was more concerned about the progress the state should continue to make after his tenure. Wike stated this during the inauguration of the official residence of the Speaker of the state House of Assembly at the Old GRA, Port Harcourt, on Thursday. This was contained in a statement issued by the media aide to governor, Kelvin Ebiri, titled, ‘I will only support anybody who can move Rivers State forward – Gov Wike’, and made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt. The governor warned blackmailers and those whose stock-in-trade was to create confusion within the Peoples Democratic Party to know that such indulgence would not fetch them the governorship ticket of the party. “I cannot support anybody who cannot move Rivers State forward. I will support those who mean well for this state and have the heart to continue to support the party,” he added. Wike declared that no serious politician focused on winning any election could ignore the electoral strength of his political ward in the Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of the state. He stated, “You need me. I am a governor that comes from the most populated electable voters. There is nobody in this state that wants to be governor that will not look for my local government. Our local government cannot be underrated. “Don’t hate me too much. Let people know that we must all work together to move Rivers State forward.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
