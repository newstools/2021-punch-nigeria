The Lagos State Government on Wednesday said it has planted 7.6 million trees in the last 10 years to address the challenge of climate change. The General Manager, Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency, Mrs Adetoun Popoola, stated this at a press briefing in Ikeja while announcing July 14 as this year’s tree planting day. She said, “Between 2011 and now, the government had planted 7.6 million trees, but 50,000 additional trees would be planted this year. Between January and June 2021, 4,000 trees had been planted, while in the last two years of the current administration, 24,000 trees were planted. “Lagos, the most populous city in Africa, is also one of the most vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding. We are not immune to global warming and the various other climatic challenges. A computation of the Climate Change Vulnerability Index identified Lagos as one of the top 10 global cities and only city in Africa with ‘high risk’ from climate change. “The importance of trees to the environment cannot be overstated. Trees give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world’s wildlife,” she added. Popoola said on July 14, trees would be planted simultaneously across Lagos by both private and public sector institutions. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
