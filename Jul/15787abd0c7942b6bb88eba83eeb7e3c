The Edo State Government has concluded plans to acquire a mobile digital mapper to improve land management. According to a statement, the Managing Director, Edo State Geographic Information Service Agency (EdoGIS), Frank Evbuomwan, disclosed this in a chat with journalists on Sunday. Evbuomwan also disclosed that the agency planned  to open zonal offices in Auchi in the Edo North Senatorial District and another in Uromi in the Edo Central Senatorial District before the end of 2021, with a target to issue a minimum of 10,000 Certificates of Occupancy (C-of-O) yearly. He said,  “At EdoGIS, we have done our best to ensure we deliver on our mandate. At the end of this year, we hope to have cleared the 10,000 mark, and after that, we will start doing a minimum of 10,000 digital C-of-O yearly.” He added, “Our capability is improving by the day to greatly impact land management in the state. We want to get to a level where every centimetre in the state is carefully and completely mapped with owners information, land use, land size and many more.”
