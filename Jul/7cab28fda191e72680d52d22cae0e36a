The Commissioner of Police in Plateau State, Edward Egbuka, has cautioned youths in the state to desist from crime and taking law into their hands. The Commissioner gave the caution on Thursday in a statement made available to The PUNCH in Jos, the Plateau State capital. The Commissioner recalled that early last week, six Fulani herders were killed at Chol Village in Vwang district of Jos South LGA, and three cows rustled in Tajol Village of Riyom LGA. He noted that two days after the incident, two persons from Kum Village were killed by suspected herders, a development that sparked protests from the communities. The Commissioner who condemned the killings said that he had “directed homicide detectives and other Police Operatives in the Command to go all out to arrest perpetrators of recent dastardly crimes of culpable homicide and mischief in Riyom and Jos South LGA of the State. “Operatives of the Command were immediately deployed to tighten security in the affected areas. “Investigations are ongoing and anyone arrested in connection with these dastardly acts will face the full wrath of the law. “The Command is advising community leaders to warn their youth to desist from crime and taking law into their hands but to assist Police with vital information that will aid investigations.”
