A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has denied a “defamatory and libellous” story (not by The PUNCH) alleging that he connived with the Universal Basic Education Board and squandered N1bn school renovation money. Dogara, a member representing Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency of Bauchi State, said the story, which was published on June 28 by an online news medium, lacked any iota of truth and was aimed at defaming him. The lawmaker, in a letter by his lawyer, Ahmed Accanny and S. N. Yusuf, addressed to the publishers of WikkiTimes Media and Publishing Ltd, dated July 2, 2021, a copy of which was obtained by Sunday PUNCH, demanded an immediate retraction of the story and a written apology within three days from the date of receiving the letter or risk legal action.
