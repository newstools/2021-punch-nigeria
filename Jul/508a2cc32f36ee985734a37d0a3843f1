The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has commended the gallantry of the pilot of a Nigerian Air Force Alpha jet, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, who successfully ejected from an aircraft that came under “intense ground fire from bandits” in Zamfara State on Sunday. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘President Buhari Applauds Air Force Pilot for Gallantry’, signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in Abuja, on Tuesday. The President, who was briefed on the successful operation by the nation’s defence forces to rescue the pilot, said he was pained by news of the air crash. “I was shocked by the devastating news of the air crash, but felt much relieved following the successful ejection by the pilot and his eventual rescue. May the injured pilot recover at the earliest time,” the President was quoted as saying. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
