The Ogun State House of Assembly has passed Animal Grazing Regulation and Cattle Ranch Establishment Bill, 2020, recommending three years jail term for offenders without any option. The violators, according to Assembly, will also forfeit their herds of cattle or livestock to the state government. The Assembly said it passed the bill to address incessant clashes between herders and famers in Ogun State, which had led to loss of lives and property. Part of a section of the bill prescribed a jail term of not less than three years without the option of fine including the forfeiture of the herds of cattle or livestock under his/her control to the State Government. The passage of   the bill titled, ‘HB No. 045/OG/2021- A Law to Regulate Animal Grazing, Establishment of Cattles Ranches in Designated Grazing Areas of Ogun State and for other Matters incidental thereto and connected therewit,’ followed the presentation of the report of the House Committee on Agriculture by Ganiyu Oyedeji at a plenary presided over by the Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo. A statement on Thursday said Oyedeji thereafter moved the motion for the adoption of the report, seconded by Olusola Adams and supported by other lawmakers through a voice vote. The bill was later read and adopted clause-by-clause after which the motion for its third reading was moved by the Majority Leader, Yusuf Sheriff, and seconded by Wahab Haruna. Oluomo directed that the clean copy of the bill be transmitted to Governor Dapo Abiodun for his assent. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
