The atmosphere at Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ojota, Lagos, is currently charged ahead of Yoruba Nation mega rally slated for today. Armed policemen and soldiers attached to OP MESSA were seen in patrol vans and armoured vehicles stationed in strategic points around the park where the rally is billed to hold. Our correspondent could not sight any agitators as of 9.10am despite promise by Olayomi Koiki, the spokesperson for Chief Sunday Adeyemo well known as Sunday Igboho, that the rally would commence “at exactly 9am.” The Lagos State Police Command had in separate statements on Thursday and Friday warned the agitators to shelve the rally, citing intelligence report that the protest would be infiltrated by hoodlums. But the organisers of the rally comprising Sunday Igboho-led group and the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, led by a renowned historian and former senator, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, insisted that it would hold as scheduled. In a live Facebook broadcast monitored by Saturday PUNCH on Friday Koiki maintained that the rally would hold as planned, adding that Igboho would be back stronger. He had said, “I can still confirm officially that the Lagos rally, irrespective of whatever news or rumours you’ve been listening to from different outlets, will go as planned. The 3rd of July mega rally will go on as planned. All arrangements for the rally have been planned and nothing has changed. “I have spoken to the organisers, nothing has changed so far. On 3rd of July from exactly 9am [the rally will start]. The whole arrangement and planning are going on. I’ve spoken with the General Secretary of Ilana Omo Odua, George Akinola and Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye and he (Akintoye) is working tirelessly for the release of those taken away. “The rally in Lagos is going to be a peaceful rally, it is going to be a mega rally, do not be disturbed about what happened. So many developments took place at Igboho’s house.”
