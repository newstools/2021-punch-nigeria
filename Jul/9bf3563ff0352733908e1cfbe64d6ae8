Music producer, Samklef and media personality, Daddy Freeze finally buried the hatchet on their three-year-old feud on Sunday. The conflict between the two started after the #FreeTheSheeple movement leader, Daddy Freeze, criticized a report about the healing of a mentally challenged man at an RCCG (Redeemed Christian Church of God.) church in 2018. This did not sit well with Samklef who said the OAP’s famous war against churches was getting “boring”. A back and forth ensued with Daddy Freeze labeling Samklef’s career as an “Egyptian mummy, well preserved and buried” while the music producer fired back, asking him to go wash his brain. However, things took a turn on Sunday when Samklef took to his verified Instagram page to apologize to Daddy Freeze for his past behaviour. “I was blind and ignorant but now I understand and can see clearly.” He admitted. He further agreed with Daddy Freeze’s take on religion, stating that “90% percent of Nigeria so-called men of mammon are 419. It’s your faith that makes you whole. So dey collect money for miracles that happens through you (sic).” In response, Daddy Freeze also took to his Instagram page, expressing his regret over the fight. “Dear brother @samklef I should never have fought you, that was so wrong of me. Rather, I should have waited for you to see what I saw. May Yahweh deliver us all,” he wrote.
