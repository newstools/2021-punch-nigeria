One person was wounded when armed robbers attacked the Gure community, a border town between Nigeria and Benin Republic in the Baruten Local Government Area of Kwara State. The incident, which occurred on Saturday, left a petroleum dealer in the area injured, while the robbers made away with about N8m. Confirming the incident, the spokesman for the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kwara Command, Babawale Afolabi, said, “A petrol dealer, Jimoh Werewere, was on Saturday attacked by yet-to-be identified gunmen, who stormed Gure community in Baruten. “The gunmen, numbering about five and armed with sophisticated weapons, might have been trailing the businessman for some time before they attacked him on Saturday. “The incident occurred around 9pm on Saturday. Our officers in the locality, who were on a routine patrol, were attracted by a gunshot, but before they got to the scene of the incident, the gunmen had escaped, leaving the man in a pool of his own blood.” Afolabi added that checks revealed that the gunmen made away with the businessman’s 11 million CFA franc (about N8m) and that the victim was being treated for the gunshot wounds he sustained at an undisclosed hospital. “Men of the Nigeria Police Force and the operatives of the NSCDC in the area have visited the injured businessman in hospital, while security has been beefed up in the area. Efforts are ongoing to track down the perpetrators of the evil act,” the NSCDC spokesman said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
