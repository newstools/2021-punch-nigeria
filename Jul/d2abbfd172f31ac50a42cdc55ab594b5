Residents of Garmar Hannu village in the Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State, on Thursday, blocked the Sokoto-Gusau Road in protest against persistent killing of inhabitants by bandits. The road is the busiest in the state as it links Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states to other parts of the country, including Kano, Kaduna, Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt. The villagers, who were mostly women and children, blocked the road near Tashar Abu in the Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State and prevented motorists from passing through. Residents of Bingi village in the Maru Local Government Area of the state had last week similarly staged a demonstration on the same road. Our correspondent, who was at the scene of Thursdayâ€™s protest, reported very long queues of vehicles stranded on the road. Security personnel sent to secure the road could not disperse the angry protesters until some bandits, who were carrying guns and riding on motorcycles, approached the place. The security agents as well as the protesters and motorists hurriedly dispersed and ran in different directions. Efforts to get the spokesman of the state police command, SP Mohammed, to comment on the development did not succeed as he did not take his calls. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
