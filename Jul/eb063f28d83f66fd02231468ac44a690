The Federal Government has debunked claims in a viral video that the body of those who took coronavirus vaccines can light up an electric bulb. The Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, described the claim as “false”, saying that the COVID-19 vaccine does not also create magnetic field around the vaccination site. The FG agency’s head made this known during the weekly media briefing on the progress of COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria held on Tuesday in Abuja. While expressing concerns on the increasing wave of COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation, Shuaib urged Nigerians to make themselves available for vaccination. Shuaib, in a speech delivered at the media briefing, said, “The anti-vaccination elements have come up with magnetic conspiracy, in which they claim, and are deceiving people with videos, that COVID-19 vaccine creates a magnetic field around vaccination site and can cause the body to light up an electric bulb. Today I would like to make very clear and demonstrate publicly that COVID-19 vaccine does not create any magnetic effect around the vaccination site or any part of the body for that matter, neither does it cause the body to light up an electric bulb. “It is also a well-known fact that persons with wet, moist, or sticky skin can have objects stuck to their skin especially in smooth areas. Strong friction also allows for objects to stick to the skin. COVID -19 vaccines do not contain any metal – this is another fact! So how can it generate magnetic field or light an electric bulb?”
