An Ekiti State member of the House of Representatives, Femi Bamisile, on Sunday, harped on the need for the All Progressives Congress, to strengthen its internal democracy and ensure credible primaries to elect party leaders at the Ward, Local Government and State levels. This, he said, was necessary in order to pave way for the election of a credible standard bearer for the 2022 Ekiti Governorship poll. Bamisile, who also serves as Chairman, House Committee on Federal Roads Maintenance Agency, urged the party leadership to take steps to avoid the pitfalls of the 2018 primary which almost destroyed the party in the state. He spoke in an interview with journalists in Ado Ekiti. Bamisile said, “I have made myself clear that the processes for the ward, local government and state congresses must be democratic. The idea of someone staying somewhere and concocting the list by proxy won’t work. Democracy should be allowed. “We shouldn’t allow anything that can cause some people to be an operating faction which may cause unnecessary litigation. We have to avert a repeat of what happened in Zamfara in 2019 where APC lost all positions it had won due to perceived illegalities and factional crisis.” The federal lawmaker further said, “We held a stakeholders’ meeting on Friday, July 2, 2021, where our leader, Governor Kayode Fayemi, assured that everybody would be involved in the coming congresses.”
