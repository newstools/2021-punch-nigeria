The Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities has said all proprietors of higher institutions in Nigeria are poorly funded by their proprietors. Speaking at the conference of the CVCNU, which was held at the Kano State University Of Science And Technology, Wudil, Kano State, Interim Chairman CVCNU, Prof. Timothy Olagbemiro, said funding was a major challenge to all universities in Nigeria. The theme of the conference was ‘Pathways To Going Green: Creative Funding & Darq Technologies In Nigerian Universities.’ “None of our proprietors are adequately funding their institutions. For federal universities, the challenges that have occasioned the implementation of IPPIS, the embargo on replacement of staff and recruitment of new ones, and pressure from all manner of federal agencies and inauguration of Governing Councils constitute the core challenges. A number of our members in state universities have been sacked by their visitors in circumstances that violate the extant laws of the university while some private University Vice-Chancellors struggle with their proprietors for funding of their basic operations.” He also advised universities across the country to develop and implement the ‘going green’ agenda, adding that the promotion of a greener, healthier and sustainable environment was one of the global Sustainable Development Goals.
