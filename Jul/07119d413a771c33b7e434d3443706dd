A GoFundMe page that was set up to raise money for the legal cost of embattled actor, Olanrenwaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha, has been taken down. The actor had been charged with indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault, which contravene sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law, 2015. However, a supporter, Oladele Matti, based in Ireland, set up a fundraiser titled, ‘Help Olanrewaju Omiyinka with Legal Costs’ with the aim of raising €50,000. Explaining the reason behind organising the fundraiser for the distressed actor, Matti said, “Hi, my name is Oladele Matti and I am fundraising for Olanrewaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha, legal costs. A gesture of support/goodwill/solidarity to assist with the legal costs of a complicated and lengthy process will likely offer the best chance of successfully obtaining fairness and justice.” The move sparked an outrage online with many wondering why the actor would be given such assistance. Our correspondent, who visited the website on Monday, observed that the page could not be found.
