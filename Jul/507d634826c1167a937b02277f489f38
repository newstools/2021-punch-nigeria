Two-time medallist at the 1996 Olympic Games, Falilat Ogunkoya, says Blessing Okagbare, Tobi Amusan and Ese Brume are Nigeria’s biggest prospects to winning a medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The retired quarter-miler expressed confidence that the three athletes would get to the final of their events in Tokyo. “We have a good chance, Blessing is running very well, Tobi too, Ese is also doing very well and I hope they will do well at the Olympics. “Olympics is a different thing entirely, once an athlete gets to the final in their event, any of them can win the gold and the three of them will make it to the finals,” Ogunkoya told The PUNCH. On Team Nigeria’s preparation for the Olympics, Ogunkoya said any serious Nigerian athlete who knows how the nation operates would not depend on the country to prepare for the Olympics. She also tipped the wrestling team to win a medal for the country. “As an athlete, if you want to win a medal at the Olympics, you will prepare very well, you won’t not wait for your country to prepare you. “Nigeria is Nigeria; it’s a tough country, so the athletes on their own go out of their way to train very well. I remember when I was going to Atlanta, nobody believed I would come with any medal, but I trained on my own and came back a winner. “We can also win medals in wrestling, I also saw the D’Tigers when they defeated the USA, it was very nice, but they have to go and prepare very well for the Olympics,” she added.
