The Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce has elected Mrs Bisi Adeyemi as its new president and chairman of the council. The chamber said in a statement that the installation of the president took place at the 42nd Annual General Meeting held on Friday. According to a statement, Adeyemi, who was elected as the 17th president and chairman of the council, is also the second female president in the chamber’s 44 years of existence. It said Mr Ray Atelly and Prince Bimbo Olashore were elected as deputy presidents. In her acceptance speech, Adeyemi said years ago, when she joined the chamber, she never envisioned the day she would be installed as president. She paid tribute to the Body of Past Presidents for the sacrifices they had made in promoting the chamber to a premium position. The statement also recognised the first female president of the chamber, Mrs M.R.A. Adeleke, for being a source of inspiration. The newly elected president promised to consolidate on the laudable achievements of the immediate past administration of the chamber, to ensure consistent and sustainable growth of the chamber and prosperity for all members. Earlier in his address, the outgoing President and Chairman of the Council, Kayode Falowo, indicated that in two years under his leadership, the chamber focused on the pledge to “create value for members and enhance membership benefits”.
