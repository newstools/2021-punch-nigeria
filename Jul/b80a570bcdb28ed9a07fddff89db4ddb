The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers has said it is collaborating with the Nigerian Institute of Chartered Arbitrators to enhance the image of the insurance industry. A statement on Friday said the Executive Secretary, NCRIB, Mr Tope Adaramola, expressed the need for better synergy between insurance brokers and the arbitrators’ body in order to shore up the image of the industry and enhance its public acceptability. Adaramola, who led the delegation of the NCRIB secretariat to the institute in Lagos, noted that the policy direction of the council’s present leadership was to strive to collaborate with professional intuitions that could assist the council and insurance brokers generally to accelerate insurance awareness and obviate the image challenges of the industry. He said that as professional intermediaries in the insurance value chain, insurance brokers were in a position to restore public confidence in the insurance industry by reducing areas of conflict between the insured and insurance companies. The Registrar of the institute, Mrs Shola Oshodi-John, said that arbitration was the new way to resolve conflicts in social, business and professional relationships, and that if fully imbibed, would help to reduce unnecessary litigations between insurance clients and insurance companies, particularly when claims arise.
