Coach of Team Delta, Samson Okotie, has said that no team can stop his girl from qualifying for the Premier League after posting 100 per cent record at the National Division One Handball League in Benin, Delta State. Having beaten their closest rivals Abia Valiant 24-21 on the opening day, Okotie noted that the “coast is clear” for his team’s voyage to the Premier League. He stated, “My aim is to take the team to the elite division. After beating Abia Valiant, we are poised to pick one of the two qualification tickets. Having failed under another coach in 2019, the Delta State Sports Council gave me a mandate to take the team to the elite class.” He stated that the experience garnered at the National Sports Festival, where his team won the gold medal, had helped his players cope with the pressure of playing in the league. In some of the games played in the male category on Monday, Tojemarin defeated Gateway 25-17, Mindscope lost to Police Machine 18-10, Benue Buffalos outplayed Bayelsa United 25-17, Owena Kings beat Unity Boys 17- 15, while Team Akwa Ibom and Rivers Bullet ended 18-18. In the female category, Abia Valiant beat Police Machine 22-17, while the game between Confluence Queens and Mindscope ended 18-18. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
