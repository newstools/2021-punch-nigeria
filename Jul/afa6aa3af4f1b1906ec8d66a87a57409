The 13th edition of the Wole Soyinka International Cultural Exchange project emerged again on Tuesday with young leaders around the world holding visual and live discourses in honour of the Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, who turned 87. The WSICE is a global networking and empowerment platform for like-minded scholars and intellectuals, both young and old. The Executive Producer of the project, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of the ZMirage Multimedia Company, Alhaji Teju Kareem, noted that the WSICE in its 13th year had refocused strictly on discovering and grooming young intellectuals and change-makers from around the world through its newly-initiated International Youth Assembly. According to him, the IYA forms the nucleus of the three-in-one programming contents for the 2021 edition of the project slated for Tuesday and Wednesday in a hybrid format â€“ virtual space and live.
