Eight persons travelling to Port Harcourt, Rivers State, on a passenger boat have been kidnapped along the Kula-Abonrma waterway in Rivers State. The state Chairman of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, Jonah Jumbo, said the passengers were abducted by suspected pirates on Monday. He disclosed that five of the victims were members of his union in Kula, in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of the state. While appealing to the abductors to release the victims unconditionally, Jumbo called on the state government and security agencies to intervene. He said, “The Kula and Abomema units (of maritime workers union) were asked to come for a meeting in the state office in Port Harcourt this morning (Monday). “On their way from Kula, we got a report that the officials were kidnapped. “All the passengers were kidnapped, including three others on the boat. Up till now, nobody has heard anything from the kidnappers.” A spokesman for the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, said, “I don’t have that report yet. I will find out and when I get it, I will get back to you.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
