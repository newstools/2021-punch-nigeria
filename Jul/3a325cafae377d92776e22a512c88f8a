The Bishop, Diocese of Nnewi, Anglican Communion, Rt. Rev. Ndubisi Obi, has lamented the plight of Nigerians, stressing that people in the Southeast have suffered unbearable harassment under the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Addressing reporters on Thursday, on the forthcoming Diocese of Nnewi Synod at the Bishop’s Court, Nnewi, Obi expressed worry over the high abduction of school children, banditry, killings and destruction of property across the country. The Synod will hold from September 2 to 5 at St James Anglican Church, Ichi, Nnewi. He also regretted that both federal and state governments, and security agencies, are not doing enough to arrest the situation. According to The Guardian, the cleric said citizens are suffering from hunger, unemployment, high cost of living, sickness and a host of other problems, yet people in authority seem not to be bothered. He further accused the government of making appointments in favour of the Fulani ethnic group. He said, “Nigeria has no leadership. The government has failed woefully. To me, Nigeria is going down. If you advise them, they go after you. People are ready to die. There is no exception. When you create an unbearable environment, when people are not comfortable with happenings around them, what do you expect? You see agitations.” “People are agitating in the Southeast, Southwest, Middle Belt and Ijaw areas. When you are talking to the people in government and they do not listen, what do you do?” He said people in the Southeast have come under undue intimidation, harassment, arrests and detentions, wondering why the government is meting out such treatment to Ndigbo. According to him, “In a country where you make it impossible for people to survive, you cannot stop agitation with force. People are ready to die because you made them have no hope. What else do you want them to do? That is the agitation you are seeing here and there. It is no longer peculiar to the Southeast.”
