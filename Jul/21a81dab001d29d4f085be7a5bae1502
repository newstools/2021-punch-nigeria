National coordinator of the group, Michael Nsan, said this at a press conference in Abuja, on Thursday. He lauded the party leadership for uniting the party and making it attractive enough for members of the opposition to join. Nsan said, “The Buni – led exco has an opportunity to write its name in gold with the upcoming congresses and national convention. History beckons on Gov Buni and his team; on our leader, President Buhari and the entire leadership cadre and mass of membership of the APC. “That history is to deliver the best ever congresses and National Convention of the party in the months ahead and thus lay a formidable foundation for the party’s Presidential primary next year and resounding victory in the 2023 Presidential election. “This will be Gov Buni’s greatest legacy and the beginning of the immortalization of his leadership team in the pantheon of APC. ‘’ Copyright PUNCH.
