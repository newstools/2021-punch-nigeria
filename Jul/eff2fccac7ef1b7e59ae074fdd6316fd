Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has said Nigeria needs to heal from mistrust. He also has tasked Nigerians on peaceful co-existence, mutual respect and tolerance, as they celebrate 2021 Eid-el-Kabir festival. Abubakar made this call in a statement personally signed by him. He said that peaceful co-existence, mutual respect and tolerance were virtues needed by Nigerians to heal the country of all shades of mistrust. He said, “The season is here with us again to celebrate Eid-el-Kabir and most importantly, give thanks to the Almighty God for sparing our lives as individuals and families to celebrate this significant festival of sacrifice. “Eid-el-Kabir teaches and reminds us of the meaning of sacrifice, love and forbearance with God and in our relationships with one another. “As Muslims more especially, Eid-el-Kabir and the stories of Prophets Ibrahim and Ishmael (Peace and Blessings of Allah be with them) that accompany it requires that we take the whole of humanity as one nation. “The significance of the celebration today is rooted in peaceful co-existence, mutual respect and tolerance. These are the virtues that we, as Nigerians, need to imbibe as we seek to heal our country of all shades of mistrust. “According to the teachings of Noble Prophet Muhammad (SAW), the slaughtering of animals in celebration of this festival is to evoke and reinforce the consciousness of God in all our deeds and wishes. “We would not be able to fully appreciate the love from God if we allow killing of the innocent souls and propagation of hateful rhetoric become a norm amongst us. “As I congratulate Muslims in Nigeria and across the globe on this year’s Eid el-Kabir, may I remind you of our beloved Prophet’s saying that, “no nation is superior to the other. But the best amongst you is the one with the best piety to Allah.”
