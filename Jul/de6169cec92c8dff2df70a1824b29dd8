The Nigerian Army on Thursday launched a manhunt for a soldier who allegedly killed his lover, Jennifer Ugadu, in Bayelsa State. Ugadu, a student of the Niger Delta University, Ammasoma, was reportedly shot dead and buried by the soldier, identified as James Matol. The suspect thereafter went into hiding. The Director of Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement titled, ‘Alleged killing of a student by a soldier in Bayelsa under investigation,’ commiserated with the family of the deceased woman and condemned the “barbaric act.” “As an institution that is accountable to the people, the Nigerian Army would ensure that justice is served. The Nigerian Army has taken the allegation seriously and a joint investigation has commenced, while effort to profile and ascertain the true identity of the suspect is ongoing. “The Nigerian Army, being a professional and disciplined organisation, will continue to uphold and respect the fundamental human rights of citizens as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Members of the public are rest assured that details of the investigation will be made public. The Nigerian Army also wishes to reaffirm that as a force with zero tolerance for any form of criminality, such allegations will not only be investigated, but the culprit will be made to face the full wrath of the law.”      ,, Copyright PUNCH.
