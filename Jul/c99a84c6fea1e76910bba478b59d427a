The Acting Commissioner for Health in Ebonyi, Dr Richard Nnabu, has confirmed three deaths from the cholera outbreak in Amachi-Igwebuike Village, Agba. Nnabu made the disclosure on Thursday while briefing newsmen on the unfortunate development. He said the deaths recorded were due to the victim’s refusal to visit the hospital for treatment. He said that 12 cases were recorded from the outbreak but expressed delight that the situation was under control. “We have directed that the affected persons be treated at no cost and residents should immediately report suspected cases to the health facility nearest to them. “Drugs had been adequately provided for treatment and we assure the people of government’s readiness to check the outbreak,” he said. Nnabu further said the state epidemiology team had visited the area and that the cases were being handled at the General Hospital. He said, “We have intensified sensitisation of the people on ways of preventing further spread. “These include keeping the environment clean, drinking of clean water and safe preservation of food items.” A native of the village told the News Agency of Nigeria  under the condition of anonymity, that the people drink water from ponds due to non-availability of pipe-borne water. “Government and well-meaning organisations should assist us in this regard and also provide other amenities for improved living condition in this place,” Nnabu said.
