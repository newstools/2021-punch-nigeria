THERE was tension in Okpanam community, Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State on Thursday following alleged attacks by armed herdsmen. Residents of the community, especially those around New Era area, were said to have scampered for safety when news broke out that herdsmen were in town to avenge the alleged killing of a cow by unknown persons. The PUNCH learnt that the alleged killing of the cow was believed to have provoked the herders, who purportedly embarked on an attack on innocent persons. The incident was said to a caused a heavy traffic along Awai-Ugbolu road. In a circulating audio recording, a female voice was heard urging residents to move towards Asaba on account of attacks by herdsmen. When contacted, the acting Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Bright Edafe, described the situation as a hoax. He said, “There is nothing like that in Okpanam; the area is peaceful. If they hear gunshot, they will begin to speculate about what is not happening. I can tell you that what is going on in Okpanam is a situation issue which I will not discuss in public.” Residents in Asaba have become more security conscious since an anonymous letter threatening to attack the state capital and Agbor if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban placed on open grazing by southern governors.
