THE Bayelsa State House of Assembly, on Thursday, reinstated the suspended Clerk of the Assembly, Owudogu Kozigene, eight months after he was suspended. Kozigene was suspended via a unanimous voice vote by the lawmakers in November 2020 over allegations bordering on “infractions of certain privileges and rights of members.” He was “fingered to have acted wrongly when out of insubordination, he refused to collaborate with the leadership or financial team of the House in a matter relating to the budget of the House for 2021.” The Deputy Clerk, Kent Adogu, was appointed to act in Kozigene’s stead during his suspension. The Clerk’s reinstatement followed the submission of a report by the three-member ad hoc committee set up by the legislature to probe the allegations against him during a Committee of the Whole session on Thursday. The chairman of the committee, Bernard Kenebai representing Sagbama Constituency 2, presented the report and moved the motion for its adoption which was seconded by Ted Elemeforo (Yenagoa Constituency 2). It was gathered that Kozigene had tendered an official apology to the leadership of the assembly and the lawmakers, which earned him a reprieve as “a first-time offender.” In his remarks, the Speaker of the 24-member Assembly, Abraham Ingobere said, “Mr Owudogu Kozigene is hereby pardoned and reinstated back to his office as the substantive clerk of the House.” Ingobere said the clerk had learnt his lessons, and commended the committee for doing a great job.
