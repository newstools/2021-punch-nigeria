Former Super Eagles midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, says Lionel Messi has paid his dues after the superstar inspired Argentina to their first Copa America win in over two decades. La Albiceleste defeated Brazil 1-0 in the final of Copa America on Sunday, with Angel Di Maria grabbing the winner in the 22nd minute. It’s Messi’s first major title with Argentina at senior level and Adepoju gave kudos to the Barcelona legend. “One good thing is that Messi has finally won a continental trophy with his country and that may open the doors for many more honours,” Adepoju said. “This is his time to win laurels because many people say that he has not won anything with Argentina’s national team but he has done that now. “Ballon d’Or or not, he has paid his dues to Argentina, and I believe that young man has laid a path for many more Messis to come in football.” Copyright PUNCH.
