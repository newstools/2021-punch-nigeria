BAUCHI State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has lashed out at federal political appointees from the state whom he described as “Abuja politicians” saying that they have nothing to offer other than hatred, treachery. He also alleged that the unnamed politicians were plotting to pull him down, adding that security reports at his disposal indicate that his political detractors were behind the criminality in his state. The governor said this while distributing cash and starter packs worth N75 million to 500 selected people in Darazo town in the Darazo Local Government Area of the state on Tuesday. Mohammed said he knew those masterminding the incidences of kidnappings and criminality in Bauchi state, vowing to fish them out. He stated “I want our people to always be together, we should eschew rumour and rumour -mongering, hatred, treachery and mischief. Don’t listen to the Abuja politicians who have nothing to offer other than to pull down Bala Mohammed, Kauran Bauchi. “By the grace of God, I have become governor with or without them and of course, I will live my time allotted to me by Allah. I may go for second term, I may not even live to that time; I may go for the presidency, there is nothing they can do. I know what they are doing. “Those Abuja politicians are not doing anything for us other than bringing mischief. I know some leaders of the state who are busy bringing criminals to the state. I will talk when the time comes. We will prove tough but certainly, we are not afraid of them.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
