The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, Segun Agbaje, had said the bank has launched a training complex to boost empowerment of youths. The bank disclosed this on Thursday in a statement titled ‘New Guaranty Trust training complex dedicated to memory of co-founder Tayo Aderinokun’. “Through our new training complex, we will continue to nurture and empower young people to think critically and break new grounds in excellence,” Agbaje said. He said during the launch of the complex in Abeokuta, Ogun State that all entrants to GTB would pass through the complex, called ‘Tayo’s Plaza’. He said they would undergo an intensive screening and extensive onboarding programme on delivering the best customer experience in financial services. According to him, the launch was taking place 10 years after the passing of the co-founder and former Managing Director of GTB, Mr Tayo Aderinokun. Agbaje said Aderinokun was one of Africa’s most influential and renowned bankers. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
