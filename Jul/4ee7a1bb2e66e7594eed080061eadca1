The Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has warned that Nigerians have a lot to lose if the country is divided. He, therefore, urged those who are fanning the embers of disunity and division to stop it and embrace things that could further unite Nigeria as a country. Ndume, who is representing Borno South Senatorial District, in the National Assembly, made the appeal in a statement he issued on Tuesday, to mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebration. The statement is titled, ‘Eid-el-Kabir: Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume felicitates with Muslims, calls for unity, tolerance among Nigerians’. He advised Nigerians to shun acts that are capable of heating the polity. He noted that the diverse nature of the Nigerian people remained the main source of its strength and unity. The Senator said, “We stand to lose a lot if we continue to dwell on what divides us rather than focus on what unites us as people.” He particularly enjoined Muslims to imbibe the spirit of unity, tolerance for peaceful coexistence. Ndume also admonished Muslims and all Nigerians for their prayers and commended them for the roles they have played in sustaining the peace, unity and development of the nation despite the numerous challenges confronting them.
