The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development will hold a joint session in a bid to deepen the commodities trading ecosystem and attract foreign exchange. The webinar, with the theme, ‘Financing the solid minerals sector through the capital market and the critical role of commodity exchanges’, will hold on Thursday (today), according to a statement. According to the capital market regulator, the country is currently developing its solid minerals sector to diversify its economy and government’s revenue sources. The SEC said, “This is in line with the commission’s 10-year Capital Market Master Plan (2015-2025), which has as one of its major goals, the development of a vibrant commodities trading ecosystem. Targeted commodities include non-agriculture commodities such as products of mining activities. “The ecosystem can foster inclusive mining prosperity by efficiently mobilising medium to long-term funding for solid minerals projects, linking commodities to industries, creating jobs, unlocking the economic potentials of mining communities, and ultimately engendering economic development, through better access to market, price transparency and standardisation. “The webinar is open to mining companies, artisanal and small-scale mining operators, federal and state government officials, regulators, industry bodies, academics, asset managers, pension fund administrators, legal and advisory service providers, stakeholders in the capital market and the solid minerals sector.” Copyright PUNCH.
