The Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed July 19 to decide on the no-case submission filed by a former Governor of Adamawa State, Murtala Nyako, and others in response to the N29bn fraud charges filed against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. In the no-case submission filed through his lawyer, Ibrahim Isiaka, Nyako argued that the anti-graft agency failed to establish a prima facie case against him. Isiaka argued that for the charge of money laundering pressed against his client to succeed, the prosecution must show that the funds laundered are proceeds of an illegal act. Thus, he urged the court to uphold the no-case submission and dismiss the charge against the defendants. But the prosecuting counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Oluwaleke Atolagbe, urged the court to discountenance the no-case submission and compel the defendants to enter into defence. Justice Okon Abang adjourned till July 19 for ruling. The EFCC had taken Nyako, his son, Abdul-Aziz; two companies, Sebore Farms and Extension Ltd and Pagado Fortunes Ltd, to court on 37 counts, bordering on criminal conspiracy, stealing, abuse of office and money laundering, to the tune of N29bn. But the defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
