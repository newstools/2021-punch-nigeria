A group, Advocate for Good Governance, Lagos State Chapter, has commended the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for providing essential infrastructure across the state. The group made this known in a statement titled ‘Something Good is Happening in Lagos!!!!’ and signed by its Coordinator, Mr Biyi Adebisi, on Saturday. It said Sanwo-Olu had shown decisiveness and vision, despite the challenges faced by his administration. The statement read, “The recent #EndSARS protest, which led to the wanton destruction of properties in Lagos State, creating a huge loss for the Lagos State Government led by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, might have thrown a clog in the wheel of progress of the nation’s economic seat. However, the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration has shown its commitment and strong resolve to reposition the state for more industrial cum economic growth and unprecedented development.
