The Chairman, Kwara North Stakeholders Consultative Forum, Abdullahi Lade, has said that it would be the turn of the zone to produce the next governor of the state in 2023. He said this while addressing journalists, in Ilorin over the weekend, after a peace meeting of members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Central Senatorial District, led by Oba Ajara. Lade said, “Already, the journey has started and we have begun consultations to politicians across all divides in the state so as to achieve the goal. “The people of Kwara North Senatorial District have paid their dues to the people of other two senatorial and this is the time they should be allowed to lead the state.” Lade, who insisted on equity, justice and fairness noted that Kwara North is pleading for understanding from the two other senatorial districts to produce the next governor, quoting the Yoruba adage that three stones should not throw away the soup pot. He said, “We don’t want to be left behind in the power equation. It has to do with grabbing political power. By calculation Kwara central got its first four years through the late Mohammed Lawal, then eight years from Dr Bukola Saraki, so the central had twelve years and Kwara south had eight years through Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed. “The Yorubas say three stones do not throw away pot soup, we are three in number, they should allow us in Kwara north. We realised that if we don’t cry out that they should think about equity, justice and fairness and allow Kwara north to produce the next governor irrespective of party affiliation.” Earlier, the chairman, Kwara central senatorial of PDP, Oba Ajara told the forum to be watchful in their demand so that those that are not part of them would spoil their agitation. He said, “It is a normal agitation but the agitation would need to pass due process before it can be achieved.”
