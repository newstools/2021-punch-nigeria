The coronation of the Olu-designate of Warri Kingdom, Prince Tsola Emiko, scheduled for the 21st of August, 21 will be held as scheduled, the Director of Palace Administration of Warri Kingdom, Chief Clement Maleghemi, has said. Maleghemi, who is also the Udefi (Obaloye) chieftaincy holder of Warri on Friday said the traditional three lunar months mourning being observed by the Itsekiri nation on the passage of the late Olu of Warri, His Majesty, Ogiame Ikenwoli, would end at Ode-Itsekiri, their ancestral home, midnight on Saturday (today) with Ogono Deleketa, Itseko-Igba, and Ogiri dance by Itsekiri delegates from Delejeta, Ajigba and Ugbolokposo communities. High chiefs of Warri Kingdom, led by the Iyatsere, had been on the ground whilst the 14-day traditional mourning period lasted. Maleghemi said, “The days of mourning for Itsekiris all over the world are over as the final funeral rites for His Majesty Ogiame Ikenwoli, ends Friday night (yesterday)”. Recall that notable sons and daughters of Itsekiri ethnic nationality, as well as well-wishers, had been in Ode-Itsekiri in the past two weeks to participate in the rites of passage of Ogiame Ikenwoli, who joined his ancestors in December 2020.
