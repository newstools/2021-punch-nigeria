A former Imo East Peoples Democratic Party Senatorial aspirant, Hilary Ugochukwu has said that the performances of the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, was responsible for his decision to dump the PDP to join the All Progressives Congress. Ugochukwu said this on at a formal reception on Sunday, organised in his honour by APC leaders in Owerri zone. He told the gathering, “I am overwhelmed by what I saw Uzodimma has done within his short period in office. For me and other well-meaning Imo people, Uzodimma has marvellously done well.” While hailing the governor for giving a good account of himself, Ugochukwu appealed to the people of the state to continue to support the governor in his quest to make the state better. In his speech, the APC leader of the zone, Lemmy Akakem said, “Ugochukwu’s choice of working with Uzodinma is an indication that the administration in the state is one to beat any time anywhere. ”
