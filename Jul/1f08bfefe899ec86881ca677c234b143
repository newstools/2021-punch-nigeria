The Supreme Head, Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, His Eminence, Prophet Solomon Alao, has attributed the challenges bedevilling the country to the failure of the current regime to fulfil its promises to the people. In a statement made available to journalists, Alao stated that ‘one-sided federal appointments’ gave the government a bad reputation while calling on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to rectify such. He said, “The failure of the government to fulfil its campaign promises on true federalism, curbing of insecurity, economy and employment for the teeming youths roaming the streets are major challenges threatening the peace of the country. Also, the alleged seeming non-adherence to federal character in terms of appointment to top security positions is giving the government a bad name due to insensitive advisers. I advise the president to rectify this urgently.” According to the cleric, the president’s advisers who were insensitive to the country’s challenges ought to be cautioned. The cleric also expressed disappointment with the defection of politicians from opposition parties to the ruling party, while frowning on the probability that the All Progressives Congress wanted a one-party state. He said, “I am disappointed that the APC is accepting these bread-and-butter politicians. The APC ought to have asked why they didn’t defect during their first term in office. “We all heard a former APC chairman when he told governors from the opposition parties to decamp to the APC for their sins to be forgiven. No, we can see the rush to the ruling party, but they should know that it is not in the interest of this country to have a one-party state. The late Ghanaian President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, tried it, but he failed.” Alao also advised the Federal Government to have a rethink on its decision to ‘gag’ social media, stating that unrestrained access to information was a critical ingredient of democracy.
