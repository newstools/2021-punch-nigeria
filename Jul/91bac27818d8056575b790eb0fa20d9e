BENUE State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Monday said the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, would soon decide which of the two zones  would the party zone the governorship seat to in 2023. There has been growing agitation between Zone A (Benue North East) and Zone C (Benue South) to produce candidates for the state most exalted seat in 2023. Zone A  had produced governors thrice in persons of late Aper Aku, Moses Adasu and the erstwhile governor, Gabriel Suswam. Some parts of the zone still argued that their sons did not have opportunity to exhaust the two terms before the military truncated the administration in 1983 and 1992 respectively. Hence, the politicians insisted on zoning the governorship to  their zone  since  the incumbent is from zone B. However, politicians from Zone C based their argument on the fact that their zone has yet to produce governorship since the creation of the state in 1976. Ortom who addresed journalists in Makurdi after holding luncheon  with 21 governorship aspirants under PDP platform said, “We will agree on which zone will take the  slot between Zone A and Zone C, after that, we will now decide if the party will be able to produce our candidate through  consensus and if we cannot we will go for primary.”
