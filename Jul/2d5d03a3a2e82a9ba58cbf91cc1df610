The Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Yaba, Lagos State, has remanded a 21-year-old woman, Blessing Lawal, in a custodial centre for the alleged stealing of N1m and attempted murder. Lawal, who resides in the Aguda area of Lagos, is standing trial for conspiracy, obtaining by false pretences, stealing and attempted murder, contrary to sections 287, 230, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. The police prosecutor, Mr Williams Ologun, brought a request for her remand with a supporting affidavit and the defendant’s statement. According to Ologun, the defendant on April 2, 2021 lured the complainant, Mr Abdullahi Babatunde, to a location on the pretext of selling a Toyota Corolla to him for N1m. “The defendant and her accomplices, who are now at large, collected payment for the car using the defendant’s bank account and beat up the complainant and his friend,” he added. Ologun told the court that the remand would enable the police to complete their investigation, track down and arrest her accomplices. The Chief Magistrate, F. Ajayi, remanded the defendant for a period of 14 days. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
