ITALY’s penalty hero Gianluigi Donnarumma has been crowned Euro 2020’s Player of the Tournament. The towering keeper saved Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka’s spot-kicks as England suffered a heartbreaking shootout defeat in the final. Donnarumma, 22, kept three clean sheets during the tournament having lived up to his sky-high potential. He was also the hero in the semi-final as Italy triumphed over Spain in another penalty shootout. He saved Dani Olmo’s kick before blocking Alvaro Morata’s penalty to send the Italians to the final. The incoming Paris Saint-Germain stopper has now been on the winning side in his last five penalty shootouts. Donnarumma also becomes just the second keeper to be crowned Player of the Euros after Peter Schmeichel in 1992. The Euros trophy will cap off a remarkable summer for the young keeper. He was crowned Serie A’s Best Goalkeeper following a sensational season for AC Milan. And he is on the brink of pocketing £200,000-a-week at PSG as he closes in on a free transfer.
