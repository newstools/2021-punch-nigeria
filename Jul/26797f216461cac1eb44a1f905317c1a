Tears flowed freely on Thursday as the remains of the Commander, Counter Insurgency Operations in Maiduguri, Col. Husseni Sankara, were laid to rest at the Guards Brigade Cemetery in Abuja. Sankara sustained injuries after stepping on a land mine in Dikwa, Borno State on May 30, 2021. He was said to have been flown to a military facility in Maiduguri where he received first aid before he was moved to Cedar Crest Hospital in Abuja on June 4. Sankara, however, died on July 1. Reading his citation at his graveside, Col. Adegoke Lawal described the late commander as an articulate, dedicated, loyal and hardworking officer. “He was a forthright and intelligent officer who was committed to his duty.” Sankara’s elder brother, Shehu Jafiya, said his late brother had a deep love for his country and the Nigerian Army. Jafiya added that winning the war against insurgency would make his late brother happy. “What would give him joy is seeing us winning the war against insurgency. Sankara who is passionate about the country, would love to see nothing but a united Nigeria,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
