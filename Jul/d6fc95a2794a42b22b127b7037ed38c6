Residents of Universal Road, in the Okhoro area of Benin, Edo State, were in shock on Sunday after discovering the decomposing body of a septuagenarian, Mrs. Agbenese Oshoma, nine days after she had died. PUNCH Metro learnt that the two children of the 78-year-old woman, who lived in the same house with her, knew that their mother was dead, but kept the news to themselves. The two sisters reportedly went about their daily activities inside the house while their mother’s corpse decomposed. They were also said to have kept the body in the house until the offensive odour forced neighbours to barge into the apartment, only to find the bloated remains of the woman. Our correspondent gathered that the two children told the neighbours that they were instructed by the ‘Lord’ not to disclose the death to anybody. The neighbours and the landlord were said to have moved the body to a morgue, while the police were invited. The Edo State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Kontongs Bello, did not take his calls or respond to a text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
