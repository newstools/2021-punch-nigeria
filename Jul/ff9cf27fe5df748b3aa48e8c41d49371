The Emir of Gombe, Alhaji Abubakar Shehu III, on Tuesday, warned against farmers, herders’ clashes as the rainy season climaxes. Shehu decried the challenges of perennial conflicts involving pastoralists and nomads in the state.

According to him, peaceful co-existence cannot be jeopardised for any reason, adding that every well-meaning person should work assiduously towards protecting it. The Emir said, “Farmers and herders are brothers, so there is a need to live in peace so as to maximise the wet season for food security. “Citizens should support the government towards delivering on it programmes and for the sake promoting peaceful co-existence and nation building.” On his part, the state governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, urged the people to exhibit the virtues of sacrifice and love.
