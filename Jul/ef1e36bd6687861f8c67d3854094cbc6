The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission will on Monday (today) , arraign a former Surveyor-General of the Federation, Ebisintei Awudu, before a Federal High Court, Abuja. The absence of Awudu and his counsel in court last Monday had stalled proceedings. Justice Olusegun Adeniyi of the Federal High Court, Maitama, had adjourned the case and ordered the former surveyor general to appear before the court on July 12. Awuru was alleged to have awarded multiple contracts worth over N2bn to a company in which he was a director and shareholder, as well as to a relative and associates. He was also saidÂ  to have received over N300m as gratification from a contractor executing different contracts for the Office of Surveyor-General of the Federation. Copyright PUNCH.
