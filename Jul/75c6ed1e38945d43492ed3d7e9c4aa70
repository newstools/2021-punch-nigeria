The House of Representatives on Thursday urged the Federal government to ‘convoke a special economic roundtable’ to proffer holistic and workable solutions to falling naira and rising inflation in Nigeria. The House also urged the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources to come up with urgent emergency plans to expand the economy, especially in the areas of entrepreneurial and agricultural training. The House further urged the Federal Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Investments to deploy intervention strategies to ameliorate the current economic situation and checkmate the food crisis in the country. These resolutions were reached following the unanimous adoption of a motion titled ‘Need to address the fall of the naira and the worsening rate of inflation in the country’. The motion was sponsored by Messrs Shehu Kakale, Julius Ihonvbere, Mukhtar Dan-Dutse, Amiru Tukur, Amos Gwamna, Jatau Mohammed, Benjamin Mzondu, Ahmed Zanna and AbianteAwaji-Inombek. Moving the motion, Kakale said the economic situation in the country was ‘deteriorating at a worrisome rate as insecurity, hyperinflation, massive unemployment and underemployment pervades all sectors of the economy, thus promoting social pressures and general dissatisfaction’.
