The Society of Women Accountants of Nigeria has said there will be a continuous rise of women leaders as there are many ambitious, intelligent women in the country. It stated while congratulating the recent appointment of women at the helms of affairs in the banking industry, specifically at the Guaranty Trust Bank, First City Monument Bank and Fidelity Bank. The General-Secretary, SWAN, Mrs Ijeoma Oburu, in an interview with our correspondent, described the appointments of the bank leaders as ‘a realisation of women dreams. Oburu said, “If you watch the history of Nigeria’s economy, women have worked from the scratch and many have got to the pinnacle of their careers. “Now, it is overdue and the society is recognising that women are capable of doing what our men have been doing in the past. It is a welcome development.” She said most organisations were realising that their organisations were better off in the hands of women as they were more prudent managers than men Oburu added, “In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, women are still trying to take their position in the society. However, many women are not giving up hope. Even amongst those affected by loss of jobs, if you go to them, you will see that they have quickly adjusted themselves to look for alternatives to move on. They have even picked up the pieces and started their own business.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
