The Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress has approved two weeks extension of the APC membership registration and revalidation exercise in Ogun, Rivers, Kwara and Imo states. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Membership Registration To Continue in Imo, Kwara, Ogun, Rivers States,’ signed by the party’s National Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, in Abuja, on Tuesday. He explained that the decision was taken based on the recommendation of the Membership Registration Appeals Committee. Akpanudoedehe said, “With this approval, the membership registration, revalidation and register update exercise in the four states will continue for two weeks. “Those who have not been registered in these States can purchase forms for congresses, party office elections and conventions. “For congresses in Rivers State, all those who have purchased forms in the past will be allowed to participate in the congresses on the presentation of the bank teller as proof of payment. “Registration materials have been adequately deployed to the listed states and any attempt to deprive intending registrants will be dealt with accordingly in line with the provisions of the APC constitution and guidelines for the exercise. “All Nigerians who are desirous of joining the progressive fold are welcome to take advantage of this window and register as members of the APC.” He expressed the party’s appreciation to the millions of Nigerians who “earlier trooped to the registration, revalidation and register update centres across the country to take part in the exercise.”
