The magazine will be known as NFF News, the federation said. Mohammed Sanusi, General Secretary of the federation, who has been appointed editor-in-chief of the publication, said the all-colour magazine will document for posterity the activities, events and programmes of the NFF. “It will be distributed to several interests, concerns and institutions within and outside the football family, within Nigeria and internationally. “It will be of very high quality, and will be in the mould and character of FIFA News published by the world football –governing body. It will be made available to all stakeholders, from the Presidency to the National Assembly, critical and supportive ministries, departments and agencies, our partners and sponsors, government offices in the states, the NFF Congress, local football councils, supporters of the various National Teams, our vibrant media representatives and other bodies and concerns that work or seek to work with Nigerian football. “It will be a regular magazine containing news, features, articles on sports medicine, football business and the likes.
