Gunmen have abducted four workers on a farm at Ikosu Ekiti in the Moba council area of Ekiti State. PUNCH Metro learnt that the farm workers were whisked away around 5pm on Monday. A source said the hoodlums had contacted the victims’ families and demanded N50m ransom. “It is still being negotiated,” he added. The source identified three of the victims simply as Jimoh, Bolarinwa and Yinka. Another source said family members of the victims were praying for their safe release. He said, “We are praying that the ransom should be reduced to the barest minimum so that they would be released unhurt.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, said the state Commissioner of Police, Tunde Mobayo, deployed operatives in the surrounding bushes at Ikosu Ekiti up to the Kwara boundary for “thorough combing of the sprawling forest region.” “Our men are in the bush working hard to rescue the farmers. We are working in conjunction with the Amotekun corps and local hunters. “With the level of security measures we have put in place, we are sure that we will rescue them and probably get the perpetrators of this dastardly act,” he added.
