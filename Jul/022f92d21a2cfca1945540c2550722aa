THE Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has delivered an order restraining the Zamfara State House of Assembly from impeaching the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahadi Gusau. Justice Obiora Egwuatu handed down the order on Monday, while ruling on a motion brought before it by the counsel to the Peoples Democratic Party, Ogwu Onoja (SAN). The court ordered all parties to maintain the status quo pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice before it. While moving his ex parte application, Onoja told the court that the Zamfara House of Assembly and others were planning to impeach Gusau as he has refused to defect to the All Progressives Congress. He argued that it was extremely urgent that the court restrains the Speaker of the House of Assembly, the Governor of Zamfara State and the Chief Judge from going ahead with the proposed impeachment. He also argued that the damage that would be caused if the proposed impeachment was allowed to go on cannot be compensated monetarily as the position has a constitutionally fixed tenure. Justice Egwuatu in his ruling agreed that it was an issue of extreme urgency that required the status quo to be maintained. Consequently, he made an order of interim injunction against the impeachment of the deputy governor. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
