Nigeria’s sole Olympics individual gold medalist Chioma Ajunwa has thrown her weight behind the maiden 10km FESTAC Half Marathon, which holds October 2 in FESTAC Town and environs in Lagos. The Half Marathon, an initiative of Lexicon Communications Limited, will feature races in the men and women’s events, with the race open to interested runners from across the world. Ajunwa, while endorsing the marathon in a video made available to our correspondent, advised FESTAC residents to use the race as a medium of gaining fitness. “I have the honour to endorse the FESTAC Marathon and my advice is that everybody should use this golden opportunity to come out that day to enjoy the fitness marathon because it is part of life,” Ajunwa said. The event organisers, who aim to use it to boost the town’s relevance in the state’s social circuit and the production and promotion of world-class athletes and entertainers, said the race would hold annually. The race is supported by the Festival Town Residents Association and attracts a cash prize of N2m. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
