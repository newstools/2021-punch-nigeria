Lagos State Technical and Vocational Education Board has called on its stakeholders to be innovative and uphold modern practices in all their activities. Speaking at a retreat in Lagos, LASTVEB executive secretary, Ms Moronke Azeez, said there was the need for its members to be innovative and creative so as to meet up with global best practices in the teaching and learning of vocational education. The retreat which was titled, ‘TVET and the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda’, had members of staff of the board in attendance. Azeez said, “We need to be innovative, a bit more creative in terms of what we are doing, this is what will make us relevant and adaptable in today’s society, which is the 21st century. There is so much disruption and you have to be prepared. ”We feel that there was the need for us to re-strategise and take a critical look at ourselves, how relevant are we in today’s world,? how relevant are we in terms of the government’s T.H.E.M.E.S agenda? We must make ourselves relevant and contribute positively to the development of Lagos.” One of the facilitators, a director of public affairs at the Lagos State Public Service Staff Development Centre, Mr Taofeek Ajetunmobi, said, “Technical Colleges are agents of socio-economic development. As agent of socio-economic development, they provide the teeming youths of Nigeria with critical skills that make them better citizens, have the mindset of entrepreneurs and not mindset of people who would continue to look around for employment.” “The fact that the so-called White-collar jobs are no longer there, people with skills are the ones that will run the 21st century particularly in the face of changing technologies.” Copyright PUNCH.
