The United States of America and Europe chapters of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to bring to book those who accused a former Minister for Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun,  of certificate forgery. Adeosun resigned her appointment as a minister in 2018 after she was accused of forging a certificate of the National Youth Service Corps. However, a Federal High Court in Abuja, last week, ruled that NYSC certificate was not mandatory for appointment into political office in the country. In a statement jointly issued by  Babatunde Shinaba and Dr Durojaiye Akindurire, the chairmen of Europe and USA chapters respectively, the group said there was a need for the Presidency to question those who accused the former minister of forgery. The group commended the judiciary for the court ruling, insisting that Adeosun should be celebrated rather than persecuted. The statement reads partly, “Now that the truth is out and she has been vindicated, we urge President Buhari to do the needful by holding to account all those who brought needless grief and misery to Mrs Adeosun and the  Buhari administration. “We note that recently when a prominent minister from the North was in the eye of the storm, the Presidency threw its weight behind him. We expect the Presidency to celebrate her vindication with even greater enthusiasm.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
