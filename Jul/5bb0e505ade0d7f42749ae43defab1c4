Family, friends, and well-wishers recently gathered in Lagos to show support for Olawumi Olanrewaju at the launch of her book titled, Quintessence: A Configuration of Virtues. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, the first-time author noted that the book was written to foster a change in the character and attitudes of ladies, drawing inspiration from the biblical Queen Esther. She said, “I got the inspiration for this book from the Bible— the story of the famous Queen Esther. As a young lady, I linked it up with ladies out there because the concept of the book is about make-up and makeover of virtues, just like a lady would adorn herself with make-up to look good and appreciated.” Olanrewaju also stated that while ladies were concerned about their outward appearance, there was a need for them to take note of their character. She added, “I believe that virtues are expedient in fulfilling purpose in life, and as ladies, we have an important role to play in society. In the world today, there is a lot of decadence in character, especially with ladies. “But because ladies are always concerned about their outward appearance, I had to link the concept of the book to the inward things— the virtues we have been embedded with and the ones we would develop.” The graduate of the Ekiti State University also described the book as a ‘mirror for young ladies to blend beauty and virtue in accurate proportions’. She said, “I did a lot of research about the adornments that ladies use and the way they are arranged. That is why the book is a ‘configuration’. It is like aligning fashion to virtues.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
