A don at the Federal University, Oye Ekiti, Mrs Oluwakemisola Osadola, has advocated regular enlightenment of secondary school girls on menstrual hygiene. Osadola said proper understanding of menstrual hygiene would boost the female students’ self-esteem, ensure their optimal performance in academics and protect them from infections. The law lecturer spoke at the Glory Model International School, Aramoko Ekiti, in the Ekiti West Local Government Area of Ekiti State, during a talk, titled, ‘Menstrual Hygiene.’ She said, “Many girls are scared of menstruating, but it is unavoidable. Because of their inability to access good sanitary towels or the discomfort, some of them stay away from school during that period because they don’t want to be stained. They don’t want to be embarrassed. “During the period, if they miss a class, they may not be able to meet up. At the end of the day, it will tell on their performance, we don’t want this to continue. “The effect of not taking care of yourself properly as far as hygiene is concerned during menstruation is more of the future. If you don’t take care of yourself when menstruating, if you don’t change your pads regularly and if you don’t use hygienic sanitary towels, you can end up being infertile. “The way it is, nowadays, we realise that there are some infections that women or girls develop while they were growing and they never knew. This is why there is the need for good hygiene while menstruating.” Girls of the school were given disposable and re-usable sanitary towels by Osadola who was also an alumnus of the Glory Model International School, Aramoko Ekiti.
