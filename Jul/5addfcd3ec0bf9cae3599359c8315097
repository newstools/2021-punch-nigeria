Cross River State Commandant, Mr Samuel Fadeyi disclosed this on Monday, saying the suspects were arrested in a hotel in Calabar. According to Fadeyi who resumed as Commandant of the Corps in the state on June 15, no suspected criminal will go scot-free, adding that the six suspects were undergoing profiling and that under his watch, arrested suspects will be prosecuted. “Within my first week of arrival, some group of boys lodged in a hotel where I kept my escorts and on the basis of suspicion, we had to raid them. “After the arrest, we found two locally made pistols with them. We are currently profiling the suspects as we speak,” he said. Fadeyi said the command has zero-tolerance for vandalism, oil theft, transformer theft, adulteration of petroleum products which most times leads to explosion and health risks. He said the Command was currently carrying out a risk-threat assessment of critical infrastructure in the state, starting with Calabar as the state capital. This is as he assured of his Command’s commitment and collaboration with other security agencies to prevent crime in the state.
