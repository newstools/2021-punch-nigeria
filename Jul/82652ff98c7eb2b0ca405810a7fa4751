The Ondo State Security Network, also known as Amotekun Corps, has impounded no fewer than 40 vehicles when its operatives raided some night clubs on Wednesday in Akure, the state capital. The government has ordered that the nightclubs and bars should stop operating beyond midnight in the state, as part of the measures to curb the spate of armed robbery and order criminal activities that were often carried out in the night. It was gathered that the raid was carried out at about 2am on Thursday. Speaking on the development, the Special Adviser to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Security Matters, Alhaji Jimoh Dojumo, stated that despite the warning and directive of the government, some owners of various nightclubs and beer parlour joints had continued to flout the order. He said, “We have to raid the night clubs and impound the vehicles because there is a subsisting order from Mr. Governor that the clubs should not operate at night for security reasons. “We discovered that many criminal activities are perpetrated in the night, and during the interrogation of suspects, we discovered that these criminals always use clubs as shields. The level of hard drugs intake in the clubs is very high, and after taking the drugs, you see them misbehaving. All these we want to stop in this state.” Similarly, when contacted, the Commander of the Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, who confirmed the issue said the owners of the impounded vehicles had been showing up and were warned before the vehicles were released to them. He said, “Some of the owners of the vehicles have come with the papers of the vehicles and they have been warned while the vehicles were released to them.” Adeleye stressed that the Amotekun corps would not hesitate to deal with anyone caught going against the government’s order, saying the corps would not relent at enforcing the directive.
