Shobanjo while thanking the university, particularly the governing council, said, “I cannot express to this university how grateful I am for this incredible honour that has been bestowed upon me.” He added, “Knowledge alone is not enough. Except you are very passionate about what you do, very visionary, and can discover new grounds, knowledge will not be able to make you impact society. “Irrespective of all the years spent in the university, you have to be able to bring it to bear on society. Textbook knowledge would not suffice, without impacting on people and society daily, because what society will remember us for is what we have been able to make a difference at.” On his part, the Vice-Chancellor, University, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, commended the awardee’s spouse, Joyce Shobanjo, and his employees for contributing to his success.
