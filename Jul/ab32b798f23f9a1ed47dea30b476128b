The Lagos State Government has empowered 130 youths in Afowo community, Badagry, with fish culture system to boost youth empowerment. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, made this known on Thursday during the symbolic stocking of the cages in Badagry. She said, “We had 60 cages here before; now you have 190 in total. Majority of the 130 new beneficiaries are the youth. We allowed youths to help us in selecting the beneficiaries for this project.” Olusanya further disclosed that the government had constructed fish cages, provided fish feeds and medication for beneficiaries to make a profitable living in fish culturing “We have built cages for you. Each of the cages will be stocked with 1,000 juveniles of both tilapia and catfish. In addition, you all will be given bags of fish feed, as well as N15,000 stipends each for four months before your fish is harvested. It is now left to you to turn all of these to a profitable business. “The idea for Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu is to drive youth empowerment to levels such that in different communities, the youth there are fully empowered to make positive changes.” Copyright PUNCH.
