Former Nigerian 100m record holder and two-time African champion, Seun Ogunkoya, says the country’s athletics team at the Olympics has the chance to win four medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Ogunkoya in a chat with our correspondent said Blessing Okagbare and Ese Brume are Nigeria’s biggest medal hopefuls in Tokyo. “Our chances are brighter in the individual events than in the team events. Somebody like Blessing Okagabare, if she can get herself very well, a medal is sure for her because there are about five people that are in the same category right now. “She always has bad reaction from the block, if she can get her block accurately – that is acceleration to transition – if she can get it, then a medal is sure for her in either the 100m or 200m,” Ogunkoya told The PUNCH. He however said none of the country’s male contingent will make it to the final in their events. The double African Championships gold medallist also tipped Tobi Amusan for a place on the podium. “For our men, I don’t see anybody in the final. “The women’s long jump is one of our brightest chances. Ese Brume can win the gold medal because of her form at the moment. She has improved on her taking off, it is different from how it was when she won the bronze medal at the World Championships in Qatar. “Tobi Amusan is consistent too, but she normally panics, if she doesn’t panic and calms down, she is also around the medals table. In athletics at the Olympics, I see Nigeria winning up to four medals,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
