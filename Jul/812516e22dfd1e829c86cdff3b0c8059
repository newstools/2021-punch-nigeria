In its weekly report for the equities market, Cordros Capital said, “With the H1- 21 earnings season on the horizon, we believe investors will be looking for clues on the sustainability of the decent corporate earnings released for Q1-21. “However, we expect mixed market performance in the week ahead as bargain hunting in dividend-paying stocks will be matched by intermittent profit-taking activities.” The analysts advised investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remained a significant headwind for corporate earnings.
