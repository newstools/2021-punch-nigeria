Plans are on for the installation ceremony of Princess Toyin Kolade as the Iyalaje of Oodua by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi. The Secretary of the Iyalaje Oodua Installation Committee, Moses Olafare, in a statement on Sunday, said the event would hold on July 17 in Ile-Ife, Osun State. Olafare said the choice of Kolade as the Iyalaje of Oodua stemmed from her superlative performances as the global coordinator of the annual Aje Festival which she had organised with outstanding successes in the last five years. “Iyalaje is a big chieftaincy position in Ile-Ife and across the entire Oduduwa race globally that Oduduwa, our progenitor coordinated among other super divinities. Oduduwa coordinated it because Orunmila, Ogun, Oranfe, Sango and others had a lot to do with Aje, so it has always been a sacred title,” the statement partly reads. Copyright PUNCH.
