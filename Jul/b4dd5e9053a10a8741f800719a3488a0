Fidelity Bank and LIB TV have said it is necessary for women in leadership to explore business opportunities and assist in women empowerment. They said this when the Chief Executive Officer, Fidelity Bank, Mrs Onyeali-Ikpe, accompanied by top female management staff in Lagos, received the Chief Executive Officer, LIB TV, Linda Ikeji, who paid a courtesy visit to the bank. A statement on Sunday said the purpose of the visit was also to strengthen existing business relationship between Fidelity Bank and LIB TV. It said the meeting also provided an opportunity to discuss the creation of a long-term platform that would educate, support, and empower women to achieve career/business leadership. Ikeji expressed her confidence in the management’s capacity to impact positively on the growth and development of women-owned businesses in Nigeria. “Through strategic collaborations, we can set up a forum for young aspiring entrepreneurs to have a one-on-one interaction with successful career women in Fidelity Bank. This will provide them with the opportunity to ask questions and share their experiences,” she said. She lauded the management’s effort at organising women empowerment programmes, saying more Nigerian women needed such platforms for motivation and there was no limit to what they could achieve. Onyeali-Ikpe noted that female business owners and professionals must make it a point of duty to be consistent and tenacious to succeed in business. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
