The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Thursday fixed September 27 to decide on the application brought before it by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to take over a case against a former governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim. The complainant, Chinyere Amuchienwa, had alleged that Ohakim threatened to release her nude pictures. This prompted the police to file charges bordering on threat to life against the ex-governor. When the matter came up on Thursday before Justice Taiwo Taiwo, a lawyer from the AGF’s office, Bagudu Sani, informed the court that the police had transferred the case file to the office after filing a notice of discontinuance. Sani also told the court that the office of the AGF had filed an affidavit of compliance to that effect. Counsel for the police, Rufus Dimkpa, while adopting his counter-affidavit, urged the court to grant the notice of discontinuance and strike out the charge. However, counsel for the former governor, Emeka Etiaba (SAN), opposed the AGF’s application to take over the matter. Etiaba urged the court to dismiss the AGF’s application, stating that the affidavit of compliance did not affect the notice of withdrawal of the charge.
Justice Taiwo adjourned till September 27 to rule on the application.”
