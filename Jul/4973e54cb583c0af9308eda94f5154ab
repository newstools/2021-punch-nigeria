Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, is in Niger Republic on the invitation of President Bazoum Muhammadu. Bazoum had on Thursday hosted Zulum alongside the Governor of the Diffa region in Niger Republic, Isa Lameen; as well as Senator Abubakar Kyari and the Speaker of Borno State House of Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan, to a closed door meeting in Diffa. The meeting focused on the repatriation of Nigerian refugees, who fled communities in parts of northern Borno State since 2014 as a result of attacks by Boko Haram. The meeting held soon after Zulum and Lameen had received Bazoum at the Tandja Momadou Airport in Diffa. Diffa is located within close proximity to some communities in northern Borno, which share land borders with Niger Republic. The governments and citizens of both countries have been collaborating on security and management of refugees, who mostly fled from Mobbar, Monguno and other local government areas in northern Borno to Diffa. Zulum, who spoke to journalist shortly after the meeting, said, “The meeting is very fruitful; we have taken a number of decisions, which include the reparation of Borno citizens back to our communities. These people have been in Niger in the last six years. With significant improvement regarding our security situation, our people are now looking forward to returning to their communities. “We will work with all relevant institutions to ensure the safe and dignified return of our citizens. We shall do everything possible within our reach to safely resettle our people within the shortest possible time.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
