No fewer than 165 district heads and 602 village heads within the 11 local government areas of Gombe State are to benefit from a salary raise by the state government after 17 years of no salary increment. Announcing the decision at a press briefing on Friday, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Ibrahim Waziri, said this increment would help boost the performance of the traditional leaders. Findings by our correspondent showed that prior to this review, district heads earned N26,000 while village heads earned about N23,000 monthly. The last time the state had a review was in 2005 even though the district heads were promoted from Grade Level 6 Step 1 to Grade Level 12 Step 1. Village heads had also been promoted from Grade Level 3 Step 1 to Grade Level 8 Step 1. Speaking on the salary increase, Waziri said it was to fulfil the government’s promises to the traditional rulers and boost their morale. Commending the government, the District Head, Dukku Emirate Council, Kamalu Gurama, said the salary increment would go a long way in improving their services to the people. “District heads had been collecting about N26,000 and village heads about N23,000. Now, it has increased by about 50 per cent. Personally, I’m now expecting about N56,000 or more per month plus N15,000 monthly as imprest,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
