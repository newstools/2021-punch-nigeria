The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has advised the Federal Government to apply the same zeal that led to the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, against “armed Fulani herdsmen” terrorising Nigeria. Kanu who is agitating for the restoration of Biafra was reportedly arrested in Kenya and extradited to Nigeria where he was arraigned in court on Tuesday. Reacting, Ortom pointed out that herdsmen who have claimed responsibility for killing many Nigerians deserve to be visited with the same capacity. “If the federal government has the capacity to arrest Nnamdi Kanu in a foreign land, they should exhibit the same zeal to arrest armed Fulani herdsmen who are terrorising our country. The herdsmen have claimed responsibility for the killing of many Nigerians,” he tweeted.
