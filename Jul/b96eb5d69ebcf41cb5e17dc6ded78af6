About 42.4 per cent of citizens believe that all Nigerians are corrupt, while 51 per cent believe that all public officials are corrupt. This is according to a quantitative survey conducted by the Akin Fadeyi Foundation as part of its three-year project end-line report published in Abuja on Tuesday. The survey, which sampled the opinion of 35,427 Nigerians across the six geopolitical zones within a 60-day period, however, showed that about 87.62 of respondents believe that the fight against corruption could be won, while 12.38 per cent believe that it could not be won. According to the AFF, the belief by Nigerians that government officials are the most corrupt category of social actors, underscores the need for the bottom-up approach adopted in the campaign. Speaking at the launch of the report, the Executive Director, AFF, Akin Fadeyi, praised the MacArthur Foundation for throwing its weight behind the task of curbing corruption in Nigeria. Fadeyi, who was represented by the Editor-in-Chief, Leadership Group, Mr Azubuike Ishiekwene, lamented the adverse effects of corruption on national development. On the importance of the FlagIT App, the Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, said since the FRSC began collaborating with the foundation, it had been able to tackle cases of corruption within the agency more swiftly. In his remarks, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Yusuf Ali, commended the foundation for fighting corruption through advocacy and technology. Ali called on youths to play their part by creating technology that could help tackle corruption. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
