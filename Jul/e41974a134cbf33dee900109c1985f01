Both sides went into half-time level at 1-1. Cedric Itten put the Scottish side ahead in the 75th minute, scoring off a corner kick but the lead didn’t last for long,as Eddie Nketiah drew Arsenal level in the 83rd minute. Balogun saw only 45 minutes of action before being replaced by Jack Simpson, while compatriot Joe Aribo was missing in action. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
