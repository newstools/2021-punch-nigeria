A former governor of Ekiti State, Chief Segun Oni, on Wednesday appealed to feuding factions within the Peoples Democratic Party to give peace a chance. He said the party needed to put its house in order to be in a good position to provide leadership for the state. Oni, a PDP governorship aspirant for the 2022 Ekiti governorship election, said unity of purpose among stakeholders was required to end the rule of the All Progressives Congress. He spoke in an interview with journalists in Ado Ekiti, shortly after the Ekiti Youths Conference, organised by Independent Democratic Elite Association. Oni said, “Peaceful coexistence, mutual cooperation, dialogue and collaboration are the ingredients that can sustain the PDP in Ekiti State.” The PDP in the state has been polarised into the groups of former Governor Ayodele Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi since the ward congress which held in March last year. Oni, said, “We are committed to the political fortune of the state through the support for the youths and promotion of better ideas on education, social welfare, sport development, empowerment, training and human capital development.” Oni appealed to youths in the state to “shun violence, thuggery, kidnapping, cultism, cybercrime, praise-singing for politicians, money bags and other social vices but to ensure that they engage in meaningful project developments that can change their lives for better.” Copyright PUNCH.
