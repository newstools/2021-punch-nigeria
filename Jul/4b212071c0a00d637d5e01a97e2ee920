The Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 has asked northern governors and emirs to suspend Durbar activities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Federal Government’s committee made this known in a statement by its Chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, on Sunday, titled, ‘COVID-19 third wave: PSC puts six states and FCT on red alert, recommends preventive measures for safe eid celebration’. Durbar is a common event in Northern cities and communities with colourful parades of the emirs and their entourage on horses. Mustapha said the recommendation followed the confirmation of the Delta Variant of COVID-19 and the rising number of infections and hospitalisation in the country. Part of the statement read, “These steps are critical as we begin to see worrisome early signs of increasing cases in Nigeria. “The PSC shall continue to minimise the risk of importation of variants of concern into the country by strengthening Surveillance at all Points of Entry (POE), enforcing extant quarantine protocols and sustaining the current restrictive measures against travelers arriving from India, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa. “The PSC felicitates with the Muslim Ummah on the occasion of the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. It however, urges all State Governments and Religious Leaders to be mindful of the potential for wider spread of the virus during large gatherings,” he said. “The PSC therefore recommends the following preventive measures for a safe Eid-el-Kabir celebration: a) Decentralisation of Eid Prayer to neighbourhood Friday Prayer Mosques (outdoor); b) Suspension of Durbar activities; and c) Observation of limitations on all Indoor gatherings.
