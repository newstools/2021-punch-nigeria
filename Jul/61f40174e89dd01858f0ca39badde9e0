The Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi, has set up a 28-member committee made up of  South-West personalities to look into the arrest of Igboho, and other issues relating to the South-West The Coordinator of the committee, Mr. Akin Osuntokun, told The PUNCH that the meeting had been scheduled over a month ago but it coincided with the arrest of Igboho. Osuntokun maintained that Igboho was not the reason for the setting up of the committee. He said, “The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, inaugurated an advisory council comprising eminent Yoruba sons and daughters across the political spectrum. It is called the Ooni Caucus. The inauguration ceremony had been scheduled over a month ago and it is just an accident that it coincided with reports of Sunday Igboho’s arrest in Cotonou. “Nonetheless the council is actively interested in the new development and will appropriately respond in the nearest future.” Some of the members are Deputy Chairman of the Oyo State traditional Council, the Olugbon of Igbon, Oba Olusola Alao; Senator Biodun Olujimi, Mrs Toyin Saraki, Mr segun Awolowo, Prince Doyin Okupe, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Prince Oye Oyewumi, Mr Muyiwa Ige and General Olu Okunnowo.” Copyright PUNCH.
