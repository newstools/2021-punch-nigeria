The Federal Inland Revenue Service has raked in over N650 billion in June, which is its highest monthly revenue recorded since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was disclosed on Thursday in a statement titled ‘FIRS makes historic tax haul, rakes in N650 billion in June’, signed by the FIRS Director of Communication and Liaison, Abdullahi Ahmad. The statement partly read, “The Federal Inland Revenue Service has raked in over N650 billion in June 2021, the highest revenue in a single month since the COVID-19 pandemic started and the assumption of office of the current management.” The statement revealed that the Executive Chairman, Mr Muhammad Nami, disclosed the information to the press. Quoting Nami, the statement revealed that the feat was achieved “as a result of the efficiency and effectiveness of the TaxProMax Solution, notwithstanding the challenges and resistance faced in the early stages of its adoption, and the downturn orchestrated by slow economic recovery.” “Mr Nami recalled that as part of its effort at modernising tax administration in the country, the FIRS recently introduced the Tax Administration Solution (TaxProMax) for ease of Tax compliance. He had noted that the Solution ‘enables seamless registration, filing, payment of taxes and authentic credit of withholding tax as well as other credits to the Taxpayer’s account, among all features. It also provides a single-view to Taxpayers for the transactions with the Service’,” the statement revealed.
