Dahlia Sky, a US porn star, who had been living in her car, allegedly died after she shot herself in the head, Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office said. Dahlia, 31, was found dead in the vehicle on June 30. Sky, who would have celebrated her 32nd birthday next month, had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was suffering from depression at the time of her death, the Sun reported. Sky’s body was found in the vehicle in the San Fernando Valley’s Devonshire area, Los Angeles Police Department detective Dave Peteque told AVN. Police are awaiting autopsy results from the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner, the  coroner added. Sky began adult entertainment work in 2010 under the name Bailey Blue. She changed it in 2014 following a cease-and-desist from a clothing company of the same name, according to AVN — and proceeded to accrue more than 600 credits, as well as various industry awards. She was open about her battle with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer and depression on social media.
