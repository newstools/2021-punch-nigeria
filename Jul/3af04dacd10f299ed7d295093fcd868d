In its bid to end open defecation In Lagos State, the Rotary Club of Maryland, Ikeja, has unveiled a toilet facility at Cane Village, Maryland. The District Governor, District 9110 of the club, Mr Remi Bello, lamented the increasing rate of open defecation in the state, saying the completion of the project would go a long way to curb the act in Cane Village and its environs. “We have come to inaugurate a public toilet donated to Cane Village by Rotary Club of Maryland. We were charged by our international president that Rotarians should do more service projects that will directly impact communities. “Open defecation has been a global challenge; we embarked on the project to address that challenge. It is our way of helping society. The moment there is no toilet, that is when you will find people looking for bushes and rivers to defecate,” he said. The club also embarked on some other projects to mark the beginning of the ‘Changemaker Rotary Year,’ which started on July 1. One of the projects was the donation of maternity kits to pregnant women at the Mende Maternity Center, Ikeja. The president of the club, Bamidele Onalaja said it was a custom of the club to give to society. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
