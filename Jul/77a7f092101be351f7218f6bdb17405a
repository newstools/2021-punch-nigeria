Lagos Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, told one of our correspondents that the state was within reasonable debt-to-GDP ratio. He said, “It is when you check your debt-to-GDP ratio that you know whether your debt is too heavy or not. The World Bank and the international best practices shows that your debt ratio to your GDP must not be more than 40 per cent. “Lagos is not close to it at all. Lagos is within 13 and 14 per cent. So, Lagos has so much room to borrow more because it has the capacity to pay and that in itself is not a problem. “What is the problem is what we do with it. Lagos is not borrowing to pay salaries; Lagos is borrowing for projects, projects that would generate employment, projects that will reduce the suffering of people, projects that will improve the social economic position of the state.” A professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Ago-Iwoye, Ogun, Prof. Sheriffdeen Tella, who spoke with one of our correspondents in a telephone interview faulted the states for borrowing for consumption. He said, “Even at the federal level, we have not been able to see the positive effects of borrowing because they are borrowing for consumption, and not for development. “They will say that they are borrowing for development, but you find that is not the case. The states don’t have long term plans just like the federal government; they just feel there is need to borrow and so they borrow. “Instead of investing the money in projects that will bring returns, they are not doing so. They are also borrowing to acquire money for political purpose rather than economic purposes. “Each state has areas they can develop to increase their internally generated revenue, but instead, they rely largely on the allocations from the Federal Government. This is not good enough.” Professor of economics and public policy at the University of Uyo and the Chairman of the Foundation for Economic Research and Training, Prof. Akpan Ekpo, stated that if a state was unable to generate enough internally generated revenue to pay back its debts, it could lead to higher debt burden. He said, “First, we need to assess if these states have the capacity to pay back the debts. For example, Lagos State, which is heavily indebted, may have the capacity to pay back its debts because it generates a lot of IGR. “However, many Nigerians states do not generate enough IGR to even pay salaries. When they incur debt, it is more burden on these states.” A former Commissioner for Finance Imo State, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, stated that the debt burden may be as a result of low FAAC allocation to each state and the need to meet up with certain financial responsibilities. He said, “I think the situation can be blamed on the drop in FAAC allocation as most states in the federation depend on FAAC distribution. “The drop in FAAC was due largely to collapse in oil revenue in 2015/16 and drastic fall in government revenue again in 2020 due to COVID-19. Recall that the Nigerian economy was in recession during these periods.” He said revenue shortfall in many states was aggravated by weak revenue base and poor IGR effort. Uwaleke added, “On the spending side is the fact that many of the heavily indebted states have huge recurrent expenditure involving personnel costs and overheads. “The periods of economic recession made it difficult for many states to downsize civil servants in order not to create social crisis. “So, against the backdrop of unexpected shortfall in FAAC and IGR, many states resorted to borrowing especially from banks despite the bailout programmes executed by the Federal Government.” He, however, suggested a way forward for state governments, advising them to boost IGR, lessen dependence on federal allocation, eradicate ghost workers, lessen number of political aides, cut overhead costs, deploy technology and minimise corruption.
