The Federal High Court Abuja has moved the suit brought before it by the 12 detained associates of Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, against the Department of State Services from July 20, which falls on Sallah day, to July 23. A source close to the court disclosed this on Monday. The source stated that the matter was moved to Friday when the attention of the court was drawn to the fact that July 20 fell on Sallah day. “Having confirmed that the public holiday is on Tuesday and Wednesday, the court has fixed the matter for Friday. “The date for the Sallah break was not too certain as of when the matter was slated for Tuesday,” said the source.
