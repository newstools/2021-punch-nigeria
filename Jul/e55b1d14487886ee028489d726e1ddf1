Alvaro Morata has been dropped from the Spain starting line-up for Tuesday’s Euro 2020 semi-final against Italy at Wembley, with Mikel Oyarzabal taking his place in attack. Morata has come in for criticism throughout the tournament but has started all of Spain’s games so far and scored twice. Real Sociedad forward Oyarzabal has been used exclusively as a substitute so far by coach Luis Enrique but he did score the decisive penalty in the quarter-final shootout win over Switzerland in Saint Petersburg. That is one of three changes made by Luis Enrique, who also brings in Dani Olmo for the injured Pablo Sarabia on the left wing and hands a start to Eric Garcia in central defence, with Pau Torres making way. For Italy, Emerson Palmieri of Chelsea takes the place of the stricken Leonardo Spinazzola at left-back in the only change made by coach Roberto Mancini following the 2-1 quarter-final win over Belgium in Munich. Spinazzola, one of the players of the tournament, suffered a torn Achilles tendon in that game. Italy are on an unbeaten run of 32 matches as the nations meet in a fourth consecutive European Championship knockout phase.
