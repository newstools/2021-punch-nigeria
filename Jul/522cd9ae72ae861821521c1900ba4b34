Ibrahim Sunusi, the 2019 NPFL top scorer, says he is expecting a tough encounter when the Super Eagles play Mexico in a friendly at the LA Coliseum on Sunday. The match serves as Mexico’s final tune-up game ahead of the 2021 CONCACAF, where they face Curaçao and El Salvador in Group A. The Montreal Impact forward’s addition to the largely home-based Eagles in Los Angeles is expected to serve as a morale booster for the Eagles B players. Speaking ahead of the game, the former Nasarawa United man predicted a tough game but is hopeful the Eagles get a favourable result. “It’s a great opportunity for me and the rest of the players to represent the country, the game won’t be easy, in football every game is tough but we’re going to try our best to give the country what they need,” Sunusi told NFF media.
