Medallists at the football event of the Olympic Games, Joseph Dosu and Ikechukwu Ezenwa, have rued the absence of the country’s U-23 team and the Super Falcons at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics which starts in four days. Both the men and women’s football teams failed to qualify for the global sports showpiece. Dosu, a member of the gold medal-winning side in Atlanta 1996, in a chat with our correspondent, described the teams not qualifying for the Games as “painful and annoying.” “It is painful and annoying that we didn’t qualify for the football events of the Olympics. We have gone there many times, won gold, silver and bronze medals, but this time around, we couldn’t just make it. “This is a country that we are addressed as African giants in terms of football, our culture is like the Brazilians when it comes to football too, but for a major tournament like this, we are not there, it is painful,” Dosu told The PUNCH. Ezenwa, a silver medalist at the Beijing Games in 2008, said, “I feel bad that our football teams couldn’t make it to the Olympics because I know what being an Olympian means and the opportunity it opens for players. It’s a time for players to showcase themselves on the big stage. From the Olympics, you can get a club to sign you and all that. I’m sure we will be there the next time.” The U-23 team failed to qualify for the Olympics after crashing out of the group stage of the U-23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt in 2019, while the Falcons missed out for the third time in a row after losing on away goals to Ivory Coast.
