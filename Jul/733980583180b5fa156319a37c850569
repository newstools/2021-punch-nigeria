Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, says the Federal Government of Nigeria clamps down on agitators from the Southern part of the country but spares bandits and terrorists ubiquitous in Northern Nigeria. National Coordinator of HURIWA, Emmanuel Onwubiko, made this known in a statement on Tuesday while reacting to the arrest of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Federal Government of Nigeria through INTERPOL got Igboho and his wife, Ropo, who is a German citizen, arrested on Monday night at an airport in Benin Republic, one of Nigeria’s neighbouring countries in the West African sub-region. Igboho was arrested while he tried to catch a flight to Germany with his wife. Reacting, HURIWA said, “The selective arrests of mainly Southern Nigerian born agitators whilst pampering and petting Fulani terrorists is at variance with Chapter 4, Section 42 of the Nigerian Constitution which represents the right to freedom from discrimination.” The statement stated, “President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has clearly demonstrated to the world that it is only out to stop crusaders in Southern Nigeria who have effectively activated mechanisms for checking and slowing down the incessant violence and terror attacks against communities all over Southern Nigeria by armed militia.” “The administration of Muhammadu Buhari fiercely go after Sunday Igboho of the Yoruba self-determination agitation platform and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu of the erroneously proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra and then maintaining unpatriotic silence on the dastardly terrorist activities of armed attackers and kidnappers including those who shot down a military jet in Zamfara State.” “We think Mr Sunday Igboho is a prisoner of conscience just like Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who was illegally abducted in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria. In the case of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, he alleged that his life was threatened when soldiers invaded his father’s palace but in the case of Sunday Igboho he ran to save his dear life because there were imminent threats to his life and those of his affiliates only because they took action to chase out the invading armed Fulani herdsmen,” the group added.
