As part of the efforts to tackle the insecurity in the state, the Ondo State Government has reiterated that the ban on nightclub activities is still in place. The statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, on Thursday evening, said the government was worried over the rising cases of insecurity in the state, especially the capital, Akure. According to the statement, the noticeable cases of insecurity are traceable to the activities of “cult groups and ancillary circumstances.” The statement read, “Night clubs and their late hour activities have heightened this ugly situation. Most importantly, such locations along major roads in the state capital are most culpable. This is abhorrent, without a doubt. “In the light of the foregoing, government wishes to reiterate its ban on late hour activities of nightclubs, pubs, and public bars. Succinctly, any violation of this ban from 12 midnight shall be met with commensurate action by relevant authorities. “For emphasis, no nightclub, pub or public bar must operate beyond midnight, starting from today, Thursday, July 8, 2021. The commissioner noted that the relevant security agencies, including the Amotekun Corps, have been briefed and directed to carry out ” this renewed vigour and directive in this regard.”
