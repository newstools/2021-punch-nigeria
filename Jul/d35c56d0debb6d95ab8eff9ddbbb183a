Clover Biopharmaceuticals’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate (SCB-2019) is the latest to join the growing COVAX portfolio of vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations says. CEPI, which  takes donations from public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations to finance independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, says the Clover vaccine candidate follows in the footsteps of the CEPI-supported Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccine programmes. The vaccines contribute, or are set to contribute, hundreds of millions of doses of their candidates to our scheme to protect priority populations worldwide, CEPI stated in a publication on its website. Through an agreement signed by COVAX co-lead, Gavi, Clover is set to make over 400 million doses of its vaccine candidate available for procurement in 2021 and 2022, pending Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organisation, CEPI said. It noted that an initial 64 million doses of the Clover Biopharm’s vaccine are expected to be available by the end of 2021. “The candidate could also be one of the first protein-based COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed through the global mechanism,” the publication added. By investing early in the promising vaccine technology, and ‘baking in’ access commitments into our contracts, CEPI has been able to catalyse the development of and equitable access to Clover’s vaccine candidate.
