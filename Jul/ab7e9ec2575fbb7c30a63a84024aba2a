The Federal Inland Revenue Service has extended by one month the period given for the filing of Company Income Tax returns by taxpayers whose statutory tax returns were due by June 30, 2021. According to a statement issued on Friday by FIRS’ Director, Communications and Liaison, Abdullahi Ahmad, the extension was contained in a Public Notice issued on June 30 and signed by the service’s chairman, Muhammad Nami. The statement also disclosed that the extension was due to malfunctions detected on the service recently deployed TaxProMax Platform Solution which made it difficult for taxpayers to complete their annual filling processes. The statement was entitled, “FIRS Extends Filing Time For 2021 Income Tax Returns” It read in part, “The Federal Inland Revenue Service has granted a one-off one-month extension for the filing of Company Income Tax returns by taxpayers with December 31, 2020 accounting year-end whose statutory tax returns were due not later than 30th June 2021. “This extension was contained in a Public Notice of 30th June 2021 signed by the Service’s Executive Chairman, Mr Muhammad Nami. “The FIRS granted the 30-day extension as a result of glitches experienced on its recently deployed TaxProMax Platform Solution by some taxpayers while trying to complete their annual filing processes.” The FIRS boss, however, said that certain upgrades have been made to the TaxProMax platform in response to the challenges encountered by taxpayers.
