The National Industrial Court has restrained the Judicial Commission of Inquiry set up by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, from investigating the recent warning strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress in the state. The NLC had embarked on a five-day warning strike over the recent sacking of civil servants in Kaduna State which almost brought the state to a standstill until the intervention of the Federal Government. The NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, had suspended the strike pending the outcome of the Federal Government’s mediation. However, Governor el-Rufai set up a seven-member Judicial Commission, headed by retired Justice Ishaq Bello to determine the legality of the strike and any breach of the relevant laws on trade disputes and essential services among 13 other issues. The NLC subsequently asked human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), to challenge the governor’s action. Falana asked the court to set aside the establishment of the commission and as composed. Delivering a judgment on Friday, Justice Ayodele Obaseki-Osaghae restrained the commission “from enquiring into, deliberating upon, investigating, procuring evidence, whether by compelling the attendance before it (by issuance of witness summon (es) or warrant (s) of arrest or howsoever members of the 1st claimant (NLC).” The court adjourned the matter till September 30.
