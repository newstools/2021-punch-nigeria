Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday said there was no “real quarrel” within the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state and expressed hope that he would be re-elected for another term. Oyetola, who spoke with newsmen in his Iragbiji residence, was asked if he could win another term in 2022 with the current crises in the ruling party. The governor said there were ongoing efforts to reach out to those that had disagreements basically on principle with his administration with a view to resolving the issues. He said, “Election winners are determined by performance or ratings by people but most importantly, God determines winners of election. There is no real quarrel in APC. What we have is basically disagreement on principles.” Speaking on the arrears of modulated salary owed workers by the immediate past administration, Oyetola admitted promising to offset the arrears during his electioneering. He however said fulfilling the promise will depend on the resources available for his administration, stressing that he would continue to place high premium on workers’ welfare. “Only few states pay salary now, I have been paying full salary since 2018. I have implemented minimum wage while many states are yet to do so. I am not reneging on my promise to pay salary arrears, but that will be subject to availability of funds,” Oyetola said.
