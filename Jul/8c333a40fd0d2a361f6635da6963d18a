Muslim worshippers in their hundreds on Tuesday morning thronged the Agodi Praying Ground in Ibadan, Oyo State capital for prayer to mark the 2021 Eid-el-Kabir celebration, without observing the COVID-19 protocols. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that only few of the worshippers wore their facemasks. NAN reports that there was total disregard to the two-feet distance as directed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. It was also observed that none of the entrances to the praying ground has water and soap for the worshippers to wash their hands as they were entering. The Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, had on Saturday put Lagos, Oyo, Rivers, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on red alert over the increasing cases of COVID-19. In a statement signed by its Chairman, Boss Mustapha, also Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said it was part of the preventive measures against the third wave of the pandemic. The PSC had warned all states of the federation to heighten their state of preparedness and continue to enforce all protocols put in place, given the renowned greater ease of spread of the Delta variant. “These steps are critical as we begin to see worrisome early signs of increasing cases in Nigeria,” the PSC Chairman said.
