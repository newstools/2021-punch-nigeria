THE Kano State Government has fixed Saturday, July 10 for a debate between embattled cleric, Sheikh Abduljabbar Kabara, and other Islamic clerics in the state. The state Commissioner for Religious Affairs, Dr Muhammad Adamu, made the announcement on Thursday in an interview with BBC Hausa Service. Recall that on February 4, 2021, the Kano State Executive Council, under the leadership of Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje, approved the banning of Sheikh Nasir Kabara from preaching across the state for allegedly making provocative and derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad. The cleric later sought to debate with other scholars who had been challenging his mode of preaching. His request was granted by the state government, but the debate was cancelled less than 48 hours to the initial scheduled date. Adamu said the debate would now be held at the Kano State Judicial Commission. The commissioner said he had already submitted an invitation to the teachers to compete with him. He made the remarks a few days after leaders of the State Council of Ulama accused the state government of “dragging its feet” on the trial and said they would prosecute Sheikh Abduljabbar for allegedly insulting the Prophet (PBUH) and his companions.
