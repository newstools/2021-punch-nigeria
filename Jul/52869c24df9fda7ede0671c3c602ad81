The Director-General of the Science and Equipment Development Institute, Prof. Samuel Ndubisi, has been assassinated in Enugu by unidentified gunmen. This is coming barely 48 hours after the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of AutoEase Service Limited, Ifeanyi Okeke, was killed by yet-to-be-identified gunmen in the presence of his eight-year-old son. PUNCH Metro gathered that the SEDI DG was shot dead along with his police orderly along the Port-Harcourt Expressway, Enugu, around 4pm while he was reportedly going home. Our correspondent was told that the state Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, had visited the scene of the incident. The Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Research Institutions of SEDI, Mr Sam Wadzani, when contacted on the telephone, said the union was in shock and could not speak yet. He said, “Please my dear, the entire staff members of SEDI are in shock. I am in the hospital; I will speak to you later.” When contacted on the telephone, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, confirmed the incident, but noted that information surrounding the assassination was still sketchy. Ndukwe said, “Information surrounding a shooting incident today, July 7, 2021, around 4pm, along the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, said to have led to the death of a man and his police orderly, is still sketchy. “Meanwhile, preliminary investigation has commenced. Further development will be duly communicated, please.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
