No fewer than three persons, including a soldier, have been feared killed in a clash between military operatives and suspected sea pirates in Tuomo community, in the Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the incident, which happened around 10.30pm on Monday, threw residents of Tuomo and neighbouring communities in the riverine area into pandemonium. It was gathered that trouble started when the hoodlums, who stormed the area in a speedboat, launched an attack on a military checkpoint in the community with the aim of dispossessing soldiers attached to the checkpoint of their ammunition. Sources said the soldiers, however, repelled the invading gunmen. In the ensuing conflict, two of the pirates were reportedly shot dead by the soldiers, who also arrested one other in their efforts to flee. One of the soldiers was said to have been fatally wounded during the attack. The acting state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the killing of one soldier. The PPRO also confirmed that one of the attackers was shot dead at the scene before his gang fled in their waiting boat. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
