The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit has impounded 104 motorcycles for plying the Second Rainbow, Cele and Okota routes in the state and for allegedly endangering the lives of road users. A statement by the task force’s Head of Public Affairs Unit, Femi Moliki, said the agency’s Chairman, CSP Shola Jejeloye, led the operation, adding that the seizure was to halt the flagrant abuse of traffic laws by motorcyclists in Lagos. The statement read in part, “The government is concerned about the recklessness of motorcyclists on restricted routes, and therefore becomes necessary to help the motorcyclists by saving their lives and that of other road users. The government will not fold its arms and allow motorcyclists to create chaos for other road users on prohibited routes. “It has become crucial for government to prevent an increase in the trend of crime perpetrated by motorcyclists in the metropolis, particularly on prohibited routes.” Jejeloye asked Lagosians to desist from boarding motorcycles in prohibited areas, emphasising that the state traffic law was in the interest of society.
