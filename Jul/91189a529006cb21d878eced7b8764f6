Yoruba diaspora socio-cultural organization,Yoruba Global Council, has tackled South-West politicians and the Federal Government over the raid carried out in the house of Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, by operatives of the Department State Services. The diasporan organisation made this known in a press statement by its spokesperson, Prof Lere Amusan, on Friday, titled, ‘Yoruba Global Council slams FG: Says provocative attack on Igboho done to kill agitation for Yoruba Nation”. The group described the raid as provocative, barbaric and deliberate act, adding that the reason given for the attack by DSS was not convincing. YGC said, “It is baffling that herders who are known to be custodians of illegal arms even with Miyetti Allah, its leadership known to government, are not accused of stockpiling arms, ‘rather it is the peaceful Igboho that government consider too dangerous and deserve such unwarranted ,violent sting operation where lives were lost. “The Thursday morning attack is in tandem with the greedy politicians in the Southwest is to suppress the growing agitation for the sovereignty of the Yoruba states from the existing country Nigeria, YGC red established its concerns over shrinking civic space, lingering social injustice and the dwindling democratic values in Nigeria. “The attack on Igboho where lives were lost and many arrested, has exposed the fact that Nigeria is miles away from acceptable democratic norms.” The group, while reaffirming its support for the agitation for a Yoruba nation, stressed that “Igboho should not be seen as a threat by any system that is fair, sincere, progressive and democratic”.
