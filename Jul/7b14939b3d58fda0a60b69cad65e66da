New insertions contained in the Petroleum Industry Bill that was passed by the National Assembly on Thursday showed that going forward, oil and gas exporters would have to be issued quality and quantity certificates. In the bill, a new agency, Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, was saddled with the task of issuing the certificates to oil and gas exporters from Nigeria. The bill stated that the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. On the functions of the commission, a new insertion in Part III, 7(e) of the bill stated, “Issue certificates of quality and quantity to exporters of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products from integrated operations and crude oil export terminals established prior to the effective date; “The commission shall have the power to monitor and regulate the operations of crude oil export terminals and the responsibility of Weights and Measures at the crude oil export terminals shall seize to exist from the effective date.” The bill stated that the commission would subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 83(7), share information and data on the upstream petroleum operations with other government entities which had functions with respect to the petroleum sector. The commission was also saddled with ensuring and monitoring performance of industry players and quality of services provided by servicing companies in the upstream petroleum industry. The commission is also expected to conduct studies relating to the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the upstream petroleum industry. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
