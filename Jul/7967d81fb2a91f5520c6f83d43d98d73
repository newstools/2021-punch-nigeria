Piqued by the escalating insecurity occasioned by kidnapping, banditry and other related crimes, the Chief of General Staff, Gen Lucky Irabor, on Monday, met with retired senior military officers from the North-West region of the country. The meeting was part of efforts to curtail insecurity across the North in particular, and the country in general. At the meeting held at the 1 Division, Nigerian Army officersâ€™ mess, Irabor said curtailing the security challenges required the inputs of all stakeholders. He explained that as members of the military, the retired officers stood a better chance to appreciate those issues due to their wide contacts and interaction with other members of the society. He said their inputs would assist the armed forces to improve significantly on their operations across the country. The CDS expressed the hope that the engagement would be beneficial with a view to having a better security environment where every life and property would be protected. Earlier in his address, General Officer Commanding, 1 Division, Major General Danjuma Ali-Keffi, noted that Nigeria had been passing through challenging times, especially with regards to defence and security.
