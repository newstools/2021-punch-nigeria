The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate on Tuesday announced that it had paid an additional nine months of consequential adjustment arrears to civil service pension department pensioners. PTAD also announced that it paid six months of the same arrears to parastatals, police, customs, immigration and prisons department pensioners. “This brings the arrears paid so far to a total of 18 out of the 24months arrears of the pension increment,” the agency said in a statement issued in Abuja by its spokesperson, Olugbenga Ajayi. The Executive Secretary, PTAD, Chioma Ejikeme, explained that the payments were occasioned by the new minimum wage increase of 2019. In May this year, PTAD implemented the consequential adjustment on pensions as a result of the minimum wage increment of 2019. It commenced payment of arrears to the pensioners of the four operational departments of the directorate as directed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, (retd.). Civil service pensioners were paid nine months of the arrears, while parastatals, police, customs immigration and prisons pensioners were paid 12 months’ arrears in May. “With this payment, each of the pensioners in the four operational departments would have a balance of six months’ arrears left to be paid,” Ejikeme stated. She said the payment was to further support pensioners especially during the festive period of the celebration of this year’s Eid el Kabir. The PTAD boss said the agency would continue to support and promote the welfare of the senior citizens in accordance with the mandate of the directorate. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
