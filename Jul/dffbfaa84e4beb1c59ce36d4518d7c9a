Chief priests in Asaba, Delta State, have led a procession to end the ongoing cult war in the community. They threatened that anyone who refused to denounce membership of any cult would face the wrath of the gods. The priests, who led the heads (Diokpa) of five quarters of the Asaba community, embarked on the procession in the early hours of Monday in red attire. An indigene of Asaba, Jude Ojiugo-Onochie, told our correspondent that the early morning procession was based on a directive from the Asagba of Asaba to the five quarters that made up the community. “This is an indication that all is not well in the community and it is to call on indigenes to denounce cult membership. “All cultists will take oaths in Ihu-ani (shrine) to renounce their membership. Each quarter performs its own in its respective Ihu-ani. “Ours is in Umuagu here. The heads embarked on the procession as directed by the Asagba of Asaba. If anybody failed to come out and renounce his membership, a curse will be laid on him.” No fewer than 20 people were recently killed in suspected cult clashes in Asaba. Copyright PUNCH.
