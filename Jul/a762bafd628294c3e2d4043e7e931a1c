The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has declined comment on the sacking of some pastors by the Living Faith Church Worldwide aka Winners’ Chapel. Efforts by our correspondent to get the reaction of the National President of PFN, Bishop Wale Oke, on the issue was not successful. The media aide to the PFN president, Mr Kayode Oladeji, said his principal would not comment on the sacking. He said, “No, Bishop Oke won’t comment on that issue. Let’s forget about it.” According to a letter of termination of appointment addressed to one of the affected pastors which is trending on social media, the church sacked them for lack of church growth in their parishes. The LFC which is headed by Bishop David Oyedepo in a letter dated June 25, 2021 and signed by the Executive Secretary of the church, Adebisi Aboluwade, communicated the sacking of the affected pastors to them and asked them to vacate their official accommodation and hand over their identity cards to their respective area pastors. One of the affected pastors, Peter Godwin, however, claimed that he and others were sacked for their failure to grow the income of their various parishes. The issue has divided Nigerians some of whom have supported the action of the church while others have castigated the church for being profit-oriented.
