The Lagos State Public Procurement Agency has said a total of 82 Ministries, Departments and Agencies are on its e-procurement platform set up to ease doing business in the state. The Director General LSPPA, Mr Fatai Idowu, made this known during a sensitisation programme for some accounting officers of MDAs in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “With the coming of additional 25 MDAs on the e-procurement platform this month, a total of 82 MDAs are now on the e-procurement platform of the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency.” Onafowote said the e-procurement system would enable transparency in public procurement. “The e-procurement enhances transparency, openness, inclusiveness, accountability and efficiency in public procurement. The system is mutually beneficial to both the state government and contractors and service providers. “This programme is aimed at ensuring that key stakeholders in public procurement process of the state have a good knowledge and understanding of the operation of the e-procurement system and work in synergy to collectively achieve the objective of continuously enhancing the state government’s policy on the ease of doing business. “The feedback we have been receiving from the MDAs on the e-procurement platform has confirmed that the digitisation of the public procurement system is a right step the government has taken,” he added.
