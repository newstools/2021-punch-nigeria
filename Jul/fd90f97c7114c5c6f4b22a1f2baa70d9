Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has alleged that his predecessor, Mohammed Abubakar, obtained N60bn bailout from the Federal Government during his four years in office, with nothing to show for it. The governor was speaking while distributing cash and starter packs to 1,000 selected people in Ganjuwa and Darazo local government areas of the state on Tuesday. He said that although the state has benefitted from many social investment programmes, it was not so lucky to get a bailout, budget support or any special financial intervention from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). “We have a lot of challenges in terms of funding. “We came at a time when COVID-19 was just around and the economic situation was so poor. We are also a government that came at the time when Mr. President has finished given his kindness to most of the state governments. “In the first instance, we know what he has done in terms of budget support to all the previous administration where he gave them a lot of support. “And at the same time, the Paris Club that he made sure that he dolled out over N60bn to Bauchi State but nothing to show. We are not so lucky because he has already finished giving that programme. “We are benefitting so much from the social intervention programme of the Federal Government and the economic sustainability programme, [but] we are not really benefitting as much as the previous administration in terms of what comes into the coffers of the state,” he stated.
