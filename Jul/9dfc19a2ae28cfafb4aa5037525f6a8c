Mourners have been visiting the Osogbo, Osun State country home of one Saheed Adisa popularly called Adogan, who lost his life when operatives of the Department of State Services attacked the house of Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, in the Sooka area of Ibadan, Oyo State. The deceased is survived by an aged mother, wife, three children and siblings. During a visit to Peter Ajibola Street, Osogbo, where the house is located, about five vehicles belonging to mourners were parked in front of a one-storey building occupied by the family. Some sympathisers were seen in front of the house discussing the incident. All the residents approached by our correspondent declined comments, but they were observed discussing the death in hushed tones. A friend of the deceased, simply identified as George, described Adekunle as “jovial and pleasant,” adding that “contrary to whatever opinion anyone may hold of him, he was a peaceful person.” “Ask about him on Peter Ajibola’s Street where his family lives, they will tell you he was a peaceful and generous man. He should not have been killed by those that did it.” Another friend of the deceased, who preferred anonymity, condemned the approach adopted by the security men and demanded the whereabouts of his corpse.
