Super Falcons left-back Glory Ogbonna has signed a six-month deal with an option of a one-year extension with Swedish side Umea IK FF from Edo Queens, Saturday PUNCH reports. Ogbonna, 22, is currently with the Falcons squad in Vienna, Austria on an eight-day training camp. She is expected to join her new teammates next weekend at Umea Energi Arena to prepare for the remainder of the season. Following her move, she becomes the fourth Nigerian to feature for the Swedish outfit in the club’s history after compatriots Rita Chikwelu, Ogonna Chukwudi and Ebere Orji. Reacting on her move, Ogbonna said, “Playing abroad has always been my big goal and I am extremely happy and grateful for the contract with Umeå IK FF. “I spoke a lot with Rita Chikwelu and with some other national team players who play in Sweden. Everyone says that Umea play technical and fast football with good passing games and I like that.” She believes her style of play perfectly suited to make the transition from her former club to Sweden. “I am an all-round and can play in different places in defence and midfield, but I will give everything to help my team regardless of the position. I like to train and will do my best to be as good a player as possible. “Don’t know if it’s my strength but I really hate losing. The goal is to play with UIK in the OBOS Damallsvenskan next year and I have a strong belief that we will succeed together.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
