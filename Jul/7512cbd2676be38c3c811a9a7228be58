Two months after the outbreak of cholera in Plateau State, 21 persons have so far died of the disease. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Nimkong Lar, disclosed this in an interview with The PUNCH in Jos on Monday while giving an update on the disease, which was first reported in the Jos North Local Government Area of the state in May. “We have recorded 21 deaths from the cholera outbreak in the state. From the 1,144 cases recorded, 1,124 of them have been discharged from various hospitals,” Lar said. The commissioner noted that since the outbreak of the disease, the government had intensified efforts to stop further its spread. “There was a time we were recording between 15 and 23 cases per day, but that has stopped drastically. All through last week, we recorded a few cases and today, being Monday, we have not recorded any new case of cholera. And if we continue to record zero cases, it means that we have been able to contain the further spread of the disease that has so far affected 13 council areas,” Lar stated. Copyright PUNCH.
