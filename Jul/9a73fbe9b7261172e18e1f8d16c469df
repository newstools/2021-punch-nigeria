Gunmen, on Monday, abducted an unspecified number of passengers travelling in a car near the Osun River, in Imesi Ile, Osun State. According to residents, the abduction took place in the afternoon as the vehicle, believed to be coming from Ekiti State, was attempting to connect the Ila Orangun Road. It was further learnt that victims were passengers in a commercial car, but their number could not be immediately ascertained. The Director-General, Kiriji Heritage Defenders, Dr Ademola Ekundayo, said in an interview with The PUNCH that members of the group responded to a distress call and stormed forest in the area in search of the victims. He said, “We were told that the passengers were abducted shortly after the Osun River, while heading towards the Ila Road. “Our men were the first to arrive at the scene and they are still combing the bush till now. We don’t know the number of people abducted, but we learnt that they were in a commercial car.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
