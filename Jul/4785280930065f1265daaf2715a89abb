Jadon Sancho is undergoing a medical with Manchester United on Tuesday ahead of finalising his £73m move from Borussia Dortmund. Sancho has already agreed personal terms with the Old Trafford club. The former Manchester City youth-team player is expected to go on holiday once the formalities are completed, with the new Premier League season less than a month away. The 21-year-old was one of three England players to miss a penalty in Sunday’s Euro 2020 final shoot-out defeat by Italy at Wembley, along with soon-to-be club-mate Marcus Rashford and Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka. All three players were targeted with racist abuse on social media after the defeat. Dortmund’s asking price at the start of the window was in excess of £85m and the deal is also £35m less than the £108m valuation last summer. Sancho’s contract at Dortmund runs until the summer of 2023 and they did not want to risk him entering the final year of his deal. The Bundesliga club are actively looking at replacements, with PSV’s Donyell Malen and Noni Madueke two players they have extensively scouted. City retain a sell-on clause and are set for a windfall from their cross-city rivals should the transfer go through. The winger came through Watford’s academy before joining City in 2015, but he moved to Dortmund in 2017 after declining the offer of a new contract at the Etihad Stadium. Sancho swiftly established himself as a key player at Dortmund, and has scored 50 goals in 137 appearances for the German club. Skysports
