Ekiti State FA chairman Bayo Olanlege says his release from prison along with five other board members 24 hours after they were jailed for 14 days connotes victory for Ekiti football, Saturday PUNCH reports. Olanlege as well as Ariyo Amos, J.I Fatukasi, Ajibewa, Ibidun Isaac and Aregbesola were sentenced to prison for 14 days for contempt of court on Thursday by an Ekiti State Chief Magistrate’s Court, Ado Ekiti Magisterial District. Speaking with Saturday PUNCH after his release on Friday, Olanlege said the Chief Magistrate, Adesoji Adegboye, was misled by those against the growth of football in the state. “I’m happy that we have been released from prison after we were sentenced to jail for 14 days,” Olanlege told Saturday PUNCH. “Our release connotes total victory for Ekiti State football. “We must appreciate everyone for standing for justice; our patrons, those in government and the football fans that stood their ground for justice to prevail. This will not stop us from doing what we know how to do best, which is grassroots and talent development using football as a tool.” Also reacting to Olanlege’s release was the Chairman, Ondo State Football Association, Dele Ajayi, who described the litigation process as unfortunate. “Football matters are resolved with special arbitrary processes and not in civil courts,” Ajayi told Saturday PUNCH. “It’s just unfortunate that football matters have been taken to civil court. We must continue to support the good work Bayo (Olanlege) is doing with football in Ekiti.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
