Newly promoted English Premier League side, Brentford, have announced the signing of Nigerian international, Frank Onyeka, from Danish side, FC Midtjylland, on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee. The 23-year-old midfielder has completed his medicals at the club and his work permit procured by the club over the weekend, according to a statement by the club. His arrival makes him the club’s first signing since gaining promotion to the EPL. Onyeka arrived in England on Monday and will now undergo a period of quarantine before joining the rest of the squad for training. Brentford coach, Thomas Frank, says he is looking forward to teaming up with the talented Nigerian midfielder. “I am looking forward to getting Frank in the building. We think he is a strong addition to the squad, and we are looking forward to working with him. He is a very dynamic player. “Frank plays as an eight in our system, he is very good at getting from box to box and will be valuable to us when we don’t have the ball. He has come from the Danish league and was one of the best midfield players in that league, we think he has the potential to develop further. All the coaches here are looking forward to working with Frank and pushing him to a higher level.” Onyeka was part of the FC Midtjylland side that won the Superliga in 2017/18, playing 15 games. He helped them win the title again in 2019/20 and the Danish Cup in 2019.

At international level, Onyeka received his first Nigeria call-up last year.
