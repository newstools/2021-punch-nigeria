The Catholic Bishop of Jalingo Diocese, Most Reverend Charles Hammawa, on Saturday said the Catholic Church was the worst hit by the attacks in Taraba State. He said many lives had been lost while many parishes were currently closed. He therefore charged all stakeholders to match their words with actions to end insecurity in Nigeria. Hammawa stated these while delivering a homily at the graduation of catechists at the Catholic Catechetical Training Institute in Jimlari near Jalingo, the state capital. The bishop said, “The world has never been without challenges, but the challenges facing Nigeria now are enormous. The growing insecurity in Nigeria is worrisome and needs to be urgently addressed. “In Taraba State, the crisis is quite disturbing and the Catholic Church is always the worst hit anytime it erupts. At present, many parishes in our diocese are closed. Many lives have been lost during these attacks and valuable properties destroyed. “This situation calls for action. We need to tell ourselves the truth to be able to defeat the forces of evil that are working against the peace and security of Nigeria.” Hammawa charged the graduating catechists to be objective and fearless in discharging their duty for the good of the Church and the society. In his remarks, the director of the institute, Rev Fr Simon Akuraga, said leadership failure was a major problem facing Nigeria and said the Church had the responsibility to give people hope.
