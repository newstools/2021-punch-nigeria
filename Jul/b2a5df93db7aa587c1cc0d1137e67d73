The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has restated its commitment to air passengers, announcing its readiness to host air travellers during and after the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. FAAN said the necessary safety measures had already been put in place to ensure safe travel process. “To ensure safe, healthy and seamless facilitation of our highly esteemed passengers during this celebration, the authority has put necessary safety measures in place, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 protocols laid down by relevant government agencies,” it said. According to a statement by FAAN on Monday, other facilities are also functioning optimally, while the airports security architecture has been strengthened to provide for the expected increase in passenger traffic at the airports. The statement said intending passengers should make early preparations towards completing their travel requirements in good time. “We want to re-emphasise that protocol officers and orderlies of dignitaries will not be allowed into the airport except they are travelling alongside their principals as only travelling passengers will be allowed into the airports,” it added.
