Justice Ayokunle Faji of the Federal High Court in Lagos, on Wednesday, ordered the remand of a former Vice-Chairman of the Lagos Island East Local Council Development Area, Sakiru Asekun, in a correctional facility for allegedly exporting 1,000 grams of cocaine. Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency arrested Asekun on May 7, 2021, at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos, while trying to board a Virgin Atlantic flight to London, United Kingdom. Asekun, who was said to have been on the wanted list of the agency, was allegedly caught with the cocaine concealed in five pairs of palm slippers inside his suitcase. The agency arraigned the suspect before the court on one count. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor, Abu Ibrahim, told the judge that Asekun was arrested during the outward clearance of passengers on a Virgin Atlantic Airlines’ flight from Lagos to Heathrow airport in London without lawful authority to export 1,000 grams of cocaine, a narcotic drug that was prohibited in the country. Following his plea, the suspect’s counsel, Olasupo Shasore (SAN), informed the court that a bail application had been filed, adding that the NDLEA had filed a reply to the application. Shasore urged the court to admit the defendant to bail on liberal terms on the grounds that the offence for which he was charged was open to bail. The prosecution counsel, who opposed the application, urged the court to refuse it because of the gravity of the offence. Justice Faji adjourned ruling on the bail application till July 16 and ordered the remand of the defendant in the custody of a correctional centre. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
