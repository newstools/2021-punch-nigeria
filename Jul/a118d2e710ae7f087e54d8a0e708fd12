The General Manager of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, Olajide Oduyoye, has said the officer involved in the alleged extortion of a Dubia-based businessman, Jude Eze, will be dealt with according to the state’s civil service rules. PUNCH Metro had reported that a combined team of policemen and LASTMA officials arrested Jude last Friday in the Akowonjo area of the state for seat belt infringement and drove off with his bleeding wife, Sophia. It was reported that Sophia was bleeding and could not use the seat belt, but attempts to explain to the LASTMA personnel proved abortive as they allegedly impounded Jude’s vehicle with his wife inside. The father of four had told PUNCH Metro that while he was pleading with the officials to allow him to take his wife to hospital, one of them jumped into the car and drove away. Speaking with our correspondent on Wednesday, Oduyoye said only one LASTMA officer was involved in the matter, adding that he would face disciplinary measures as stipulated by the civil service rules. He said, “We have civil service rules; the officer took two actions that he should not have taken and he’s going to be dealt with according to the civil service rules. “As long as the issue of theft or loss of money and passport seizure is still in place, then it becomes another matter where there is criminality involved; so, the police will have to be involved. “There is indiscipline on the part of the officer and he will face disciplinary procedures as established by the civil service rules. Where there is criminality established, then the police get involved.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
