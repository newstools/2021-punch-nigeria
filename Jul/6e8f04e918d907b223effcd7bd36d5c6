Members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the National Assembly have thrown their weights behind the recent resolutions of the Southern governors. The governors had met in Lagos on Monday and demanded the inclusion of the electronic transfer of results in the 2010 Electoral Act amendment Bill 2021 and the inclusion of the state police in the ongoing 1999 constitution review. The governors also rejected the 3 per cent oil equity share for the host communities, among others. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the PDP Senators led by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe and Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, commended the governors for the courage they displayed in taking their bold steps notwithstanding their political party differences. The opposition lawmakers also pledged to remain actively committed in their legislative activities to ensure that all the demands of the governors were met in the various legislation pending before the National Assembly.
