Novak Djokovic said Sunday he considers himself the “best player” after winning a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title but refuses to anoint himself as the “greatest of all time”. The 34-year-old went to 20 majors alongside Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal courtesy of a sixth Wimbledon title secured by a 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Italy’s Matteo Berrettini. If he wins a fourth US Open in September, he will become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to complete the calendar Grand Slam and just the third in history. “I consider myself best and I believe that I am the best, otherwise I wouldn’t be talking confidently about winning Slams and making history,” said Djokovic. “But whether I’m the greatest of all time or not, I leave that debate to other people. “I said before that it’s very difficult to compare the eras of tennis. We have different racquets, technology, balls, courts. It’s just completely different conditions that we’re playing in, so it’s very hard to compare from 50 years ago to today. “However, I am extremely honoured to definitely be part of the conversation.” Despite his caution, Djokovic knows he has time and momentum on his side. At 34, he is a year younger than Nadal and has the best part of six years on Federer who turns 40 in four weeks’ time. Nadal skipped Wimbledon after losing to Djokovic in the French Open semi-finals last month. Federer made a quarter-final exit at the All England Club.
