Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Nengi Hampson, has acquired a Range Rover Velar. The reality TV star took to her Instagram story on Tuesday to show off her new SUV. In the videos posted on her Instagram story, Nengi was seen dressed in a white crop top and sweat pants, posing with her white Range Rover. Fellow ex-housemate, Tochi, congratulated Nengi on her acquisition as he reposted the video on his Instagram story. In March this year, the reality TV star acquired a new house. She took to Instagram and Twitter to celebrate her achievement as she wrote, “2021 just keeps getting better. With consistency, dedication, and hard work, I finally get to tick this off my checklist. Thank you Lord for continued blessings. Can’t wait to play table tennis with my friends in my ‘Pengi’ home.”
