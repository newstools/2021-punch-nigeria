EKITI State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Tuesday, described his Ondo State counterpart, Rotimi Akeredolu, as a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. Fayemi said Akeredolu has spent a larger part of his life serving the people as “a students’ union activist, legal luminary, advocate of good governance and currently as Governor who is leaving no stone unturned in the quest for the betterment of Ondo State and its people”. The governor, who is the Chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum, in a congratulatory message to Akeredolu on his 65th birthday, described the Ondo State governor as “a dogged fighter, a strong voice in the fight against injustice and a man who does not shy away from speaking the truth regardless of whose ox is gored”. In a message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, titled, ‘Fayemi congratulates Akeredolu at 65,’ he said, “Governor Akeredolu has spent his entire life in the service of his people. He is a patriotic Nigerian, who is very passionate about one united, peaceful and progressive Nigeria. A compassionate leader, who is ever concerned about the welfare of his people. “We wish him many more useful and productive years in service to God and humanity.” Copyright PUNCH.
