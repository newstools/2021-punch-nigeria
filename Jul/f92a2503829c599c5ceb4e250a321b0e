About 10 people have lost their lives in a fatal road accident in Kambi village along Ilorin-Jebba Express in the Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State. The incident which occurred in the early hours of Friday involved a white Toyota Hiace commercial bus with the number plate, XC 157 SMK, and a Ford truck used for transporting logs of wood. The bus, which took off from Minna, Niger State, was said to be heading for the South with some of the passengers travelling for Sallah. Nineteen people including the driver were said to be involved in the accident out of which 10 died instantly, a source told our correspondent.
