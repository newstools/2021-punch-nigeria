The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has received the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, and his Cross River State counterpart, Ben Ayade, at the State House in Abuja on Monday. Both governors recently dumped the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party for the ruling All Progressives Congress. Though the details of their meeting are yet to be known, photos were, however, shared on the Facebook page of the Nigerian Government. The photos were captioned, “President Muhammadu Buhari receives in audience New APC Governors of Cross River and Zamfara State led by APC Chairman Caretaker Committee at the State House, Abuja | 12th July 2021.” The PUNCH reported that Matawalle dumped the PDP for the APC last month and was immediately made the leader of the party in Zamfara State. Ayade who also became the APC leader in his state after his defection stated that he joined the party to enable him to align his state with the government at the centre. He said, “We need to join hands with President Buhari in his determination to enhance the fortunes of the country. “I need all governors to similarly join me and understand my decision to join the APC. “We need to work ahead with the President for the future and unity of Nigeria. We all need to sit at the same dining table with Mr President to save Nigeria. “It is my responsibility to bring back Cross River to the centre in order to enhance her fortunes. “I, therefore, formally declare myself as a member and leader of the APC in Cross River State.”
