At least 28 people were killed on Monday when a bus packed with people heading home for the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday in Pakistan crashed into a truck, officials said. The accident happened around 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Multan, in Punjab province. Government official Shezad ul-Islam said 40 people were injured in the accident, and the death toll was likely to rise as some were in critical condition. Eid al-Adha is one of the biggest celebrations on the Muslim calendar, when families slaughter animals and share the meat with the poor. Huge numbers of people have been crossing the country in recent days to return home to their families. Pakistan has a terrible traffic safety record with thousands of accidents a year due to substandard roads, poorly maintained vehicles and reckless driving. (AFP)
