A missionary school, Samuel Bill Secondary School, in the Abak Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, will soon reopen it gates to students after being shut for over 33-years. The school owned by the Qua Iboe church, which later split to United Evangelical Church, was shut during the students’ demonstration in 1989. The President of the alumni association, Mr Churchill Udoh, in a statement on Tuesday after areunion ceremony in Uyo, said renovation work had been carried out in the school preparatory to reopening of the institution in September next year. He said, “The Samuel Bill Secondary School, Abak, will reopen its gate to students come September 2022. “A lot of work has been done towards rebuilding infrastructure and putting the right structures in place to reopen the school. And this will be in partnership with both the Qua Iboe Church and United Evangelical Church, who are the two factions of the original Qua Iboe Church that owned the school” Udoh explained that the school operated for only 10 years since 1979, adding that due to the quality of training, many graduates of the school were in various leadership positions in government, business, professional practice and church administration.
