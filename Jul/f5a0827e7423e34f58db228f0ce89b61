A former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria in the 2019 election and ex-Minister of Education, Obiageli Ezekwesili, has demanded an investigation into the violence that occurred at Ladipo market, Lagos state, on Tuesday. As earlier reported by PUNCH Metro, three traders were shot dead by military officers during a clash with union members and traders at the Aguiyi Ironsi International Trade Centre, in the Paramo area of Ladipo Market, Lagos State. Quoting a viral video of the incident, Ezekwesili questioned the Nigerian Army on why its personnel had taken a violent approach towards civilians. “@DefenceInfoNG @HQNigerianArmy have just seen this and wonder why your men have chosen this approach against civilian population.” She tweeted. The former presidential candidate also called for “investigation of the incident and sanction of those who unleashed such violence in the Ladipo spare parts market.” “End such behavior,” She continued. While accounts of events that led to the violence differ, and are still unconfirmed, authorities of the Nigerian Airforce whose members were also present at the scene stated that investigation was going on as regards the matter. Speaking with The PUNCH, Nigerian Airforce Director of Public Relations and Information, Edward Gabkwat, said that while Airforce personnel were present at the scene, they did not open fire on anyone in the market. “It was an unfortunate situation. It wasn’t as if it was the air force men that opened fire, but the rifle, which belongs to the air force personnel, has been retrieved. I understand one or two people died, but it is unconfirmed. Our base commander has been told to get to the root of the matter,” he said.
