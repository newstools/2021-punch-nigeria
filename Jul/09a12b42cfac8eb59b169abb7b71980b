The Southern Governors’ Forum has said that it is committed to “the unity of Nigeria on the pillars of equity, fairness, justice, progress and peaceful co-existence between and amongst its people.” The Forum stated this in a communique issued after a meeting held in Lagos which was attended by all 17 southern governors. “Re-affirmed their commitment to the unity of Nigeria on the pillars of equity, fairness, justice, progress and peaceful co-existence between and amongst its people. “The Forum reiterates its commitment to the politics of equity, fairness and unanimously agrees that the presidency of Nigeria be rotated between Southern and Northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the Southern Region,” it partly read. The communique signed by the Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, comes amid agitations from different groups for the disintegration of Nigeria. The Indigenous People of Biafra in the South-East led by Nnamdi Kanu and other groups are clamouring for the restoration of the defunct Republic of Biafra. In the South-West, different groups under the umbrella of Ilana Oodua staged a rally last Saturday in Lagos to demand a separate nation for the Yoruba ethnic group.
