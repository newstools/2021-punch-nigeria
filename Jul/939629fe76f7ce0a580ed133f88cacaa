Some bandits in the early hours of Sunday raided the staff quarters of the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre, Zaria in Kaduna State and abducted seven, including a nursing mother. It was learnt that the hoodlums also attacked the nearby Saye Police Divisional Headquarters, apparently to prevent officers from rescuing the victims. The incident, a source said, happened around 12:30 am (Sunday). According to the source, the bandits surrounded the quarters and succeeded in picking five staff and two others, including a nursing mother. The source told our correspondent that the bandits targeted the Principal of the centre who worked late into Saturday night. “The hoodlums also stormed the residence of the principal but was nowhere to be found. The house was also damaged before they could access it,” he said He added that the Police division was riddled with bullets by the bandits, adding “the operational Hilux Van was damaged by the gunmen who came in large numbers.” The police in Kaduna State confirmed the attack. The state Command’s spokesman, Mohammed Jalige, said the command had launched an investigation into the matter and that efforts to rescue the victims unhurt were on.
