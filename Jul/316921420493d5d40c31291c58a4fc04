The House of Representatives has mandated its Committee on Police Affairs to liaise with the Nigeria Police Force to “investigate, apprehend and prosecute” those who assassinated the Director-General of the Science and Equipment Development Institute, Prof. Samuel Ndubisi, along with his police orderly in Enugu on Wednesday. The House took the step based on a motion of urgent public importance moved by the Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, at the plenary on Thursday. Moving the motion, titled ‘Gruesome Murder of Director General of Scientific Equipment Development Institute, Enugu, Prof Samuel Ndubuisi’, Okechukwu recalled another recent incident in June 2021, where a police inspector shot sporadically killing five persons in Enugu. He said, “The House is concerned about the state of insecurity in Enugu recently. The primary purpose of every government is the welfare of the people and security of lives and property. “The House is convinced that bringing the killers to book would serve as deterrence to other criminal elements in the federation. “The House is conscious of investments by the various state governments in the area of security and the overwhelming challenges which the states are burdened with. “The House is mindful of the efforts of the current Inspector-General of Police in repositioning the police for modern challenges and curbing the repeated killings of our citizens.”
