SUPER Eagles midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo has revealed that his compatriots William Troost-Ekong and Isaac Success were instrumental in him joining Watford this summer, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. Emmanuel Dennis, Tom Dele-Bashiru and Dapo Mebude are the other Nigerian players at Watford. The 25-year-old joined the Hornets last week from English Championship club Stoke City on a season loan deal, with an option to buy. It is Etebo’s third loan deal away from Stoke since he signed a five-year contract with them just ahead of playing for Nigeria at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The midfielder, who overlooked a deal to stay at Galatasaray for another season, said Troost-Ekong and Success acted as persuaders in luring him to Vicarage Road. “The very minute they knew there was an offer from the club (Watford) they told me good things about the club,” Etebo told PUNCH Sports Extra in an exclusive interview. “With them around, I knew I would easily adapt. I’m confident I will get enough playing time. “Also, the coach (Xisco Munoz) wanted me here, which was also important. The Premier League is tough but I hope to help the team keep their status.” Etebo made his international debut for Nigeria in March 2016 and has won 38 caps, scoring twice for the three-time African champions. Named CAF’s Most Promising Talent for 2015, Etebo was top scorer as Nigeria won that year’s African U-23 Championship in Dakar, Senegal, before he then scored four goals to help his country clinch Olympic bronze at Rio 2016.
