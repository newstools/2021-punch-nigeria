Super Falcons coach, Randy Waldrum, is impressed with the intensity of the players after day two of training in Vienna, Austria. The reigning African champions arrived in the Austrian capital last Thursday for an eight-day intensive training camp as part of the preparations for the forthcoming Aisha Buhari Invitational Women’s Football Tournament. The tournament, which will be held in Lagos in September, has the Falcons battling Ghana’s Black Queens, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lionesses, Banyana Banyana of South Africa, Morocco, and Mali. After few days of training with the squad, Waldrum says he has been left impressed with how well they are responding to his philosophy. “Another good morning of training with @NGSuper_Falcons.  The players responding well and the intensity is first class! #GettingBetterEveryday,” Waldrum tweeted on Sunday. The team has seen the return of former captain, Desire Oparanozie, who has been on hiatus from the team since 2019 after the country’s participation at the senior women’s World Cup in France.
