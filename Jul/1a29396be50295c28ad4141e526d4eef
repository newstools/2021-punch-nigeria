A professor of Soil Science, University of Calabar, Cross River State, Peter Ogban, who was jailed on March 25, 2021 for electoral offences during the 2019 polls in Akwa Ibom State, has applied for bail pending the determination of his case by the Court of Appeal. Ogban, who was the collation/returning officer during the National Assembly election, was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by the Akwa Ibom High Court 2 sitting in the Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area of the state. He was found guilty of manipulating and falsifying the result in the Oruk Anam and Etim Ekpo local government areas in favour of the All Progressives Congress. His application for bail was filed on June 17, 2021, through his counsel led by Kanu Agabi, (SAN), and supported by a 16-paragraph affidavit. At the hearing of the bail application on Thursday before the Akwa Ibom State High Court presided over by Justice Pius Idiong, counsel to the applicant said his client’s application for bail on health grounds was pending at the appellate court as stated in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the affidavit and urged the court to use it discretion to grant bail to the professor, adding that Ogban did not have any criminal record before his conviction in March. But the counsel for the Independent National Electoral Commission, Clement Onwuenwunor, opposed the application and filled a 21-paragraph counter-affidavit. Onwuenwunor said before such an application could be granted, the applicant must first demonstrate exceptional circumstances or unusual reasons before the court could exercise discretion in his favour. Justice Idiong thanked the lawyers for their submissions and adjourned the case till July 12, 2021, for ruling. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
