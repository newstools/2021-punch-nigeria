Tennis star Roger Federer has raised millions of dollars for his charitable foundation with the sale of his old equipment, the London auction house Christie’s said on Thursday. The auction took place on June 23 and subsequently online to raise 3,392,875 pounds (4,689,316 dollars), Christie’s said. Items sold include a racquet from the 2007 Wimbledon final against Rafael Nadal and shoes from his only French Open victory in 2009. Federer’s foundation supports education projects for disadvantaged children in Africa and his native Switzerland. The 39-year-old Federer has won a joint-record 20 grand slams but exited the latest edition of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage. Also, he has withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympic Games due to knee problems. (dpa/NAN)
