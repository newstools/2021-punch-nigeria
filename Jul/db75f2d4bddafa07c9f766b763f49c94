Two buildings collapsed on Wednesday  in different locations in Anambra State . While a two-storey building under construction collapsed in Amikwo,  in the Awka South Local Government Areas, another two-storey building collapsed in Oko, in the  Orumba LGA. Four persons out of the 20 said to be trapped in the two incidents were reportedly rescued as of the time of filing the report. A eyewitness said, “The Awka building around 2am, falling on part of an occupied  two-storey building, trapping many.” The building had been sealed by officials of the Awka Capital Territory Development Authority when our correspondent visited the scene. The Managing Director, ACTDA, Ven. Amaechi Okwuosa said the Awka building had been under construction for the past 10 years and was marked for demolition in 2018. “He said, “Although the developer had commenced demolition of the building, the right equipment was not used, hence the collapse. Four persons have been rescued with varying degrees if injury.” Speaking on the Oko incident, the Executive Chairman of Anambra Physical Planning Board, Chike Maduekwe, blamed the incident on “compromise on structural integrity.” He said the structure had been sealed, while the developer had been summoned to his office.
