The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has said the 49 suspects arrested during the aborted Oodua Republic Mega Rally in the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park will be charged to court after investigation into their offences is completed. Odumosu told our correspondent on the telephone on Monday that the command was still gathering evidence, adding that after completing the investigation, the suspects would go to court. He said, “Investigation is ongoing, when we complete the investigation, they will be charged. For now, the investigation is still ongoing and after we gather further evidence, we will charge them to court.” Contrary to claims that plans were on to relocate the suspects to Abuja for further prosecution, Odumosu, who debunked the claim, said, “They are not to be taken to Abuja.” Copyright PUNCH.
