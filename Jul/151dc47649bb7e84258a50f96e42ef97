Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has summoned the Secretary to the State Government; the state House of Assembly member representing Port Harcourt Constituency 2, Tonye Adoki; and the Port Harcourt Local Government Council Chairman to a meeting to deliberate on how to sanitise the Marine Base area of Port Harcourt. The governor announced his intention to hold the meeting with the officials during a ceremony to signal the commencement of the reconstruction of Rivers State Government House Jetty at Marine Base Waterfront in Port Harcourt on Wednesday. Wike noted with dismay the destruction of the rich tourism opportunities offered by the beautiful marine features around the area by the residents of shanties at Marine Base axis of Port Harcourt. He stated, “What has set Rivers State back is ethnicity. What has made us not to progress so far is that we blindfold ourselves not to know the truth. “If we have a place like this, do you know how many people would like to come to Rivers State? Today, we are talking about tourism, and how can you say that there should be a tourism centre when you have all these shanties around? “Let me say it, and I don’t care what anybody will say; nobody will set Rivers State backward.” The governor noted how the residents encroached on the land where the facility is located. Wike was quoted as saying in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, that security personnel gave the trespassers a good fight before evicting them to clear the site for the ceremony.
