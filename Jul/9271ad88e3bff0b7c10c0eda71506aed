A Nigerian woman based in Brazil, Mrs. Anita Ugochinyere Ogbonna, has been arrested by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja with 100 pellets of cocaine concealed in her private part and handbag. The agency said the mother of three was arrested on Friday night on arrival in Abuja via Qatar Air from Sao Paulo, Brazil through Doha. “Upon a proper search, 12 wraps of cocaine inserted in her private part were extracted while another 88 pellets stuffed in socks were discovered hidden in her handbag”, the NDLEA Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, said in a statement on Sunday. During interrogation, Ogbonna, a mother of three children, all resident in Brazil, claimed she lost her husband three years ago. Babafemi said, “She confessed she decided to traffick the illicit drug to raise money for the burial of her father scheduled for July 22 in Imo state. She said one Emeka, alias KC also based in Brazil gave her the drug to deliver in Nigeria for a fee of $3,000. “Ogbonna said she pushed the wraps of cocaine into her private part after her attempts to swallow the pellets failed. The suspect who owns a shop where she sells African foodstuffs in Brazil further claimed she had to drop her three young children with a Kenyan lady who is her neighbour in Brazil before she embarked on the quick-money-journey.” Meanwhile, narcotic officers attached to a courier company in Lagos have intercepted 500grams of ketamine concealed in the walls of a wooden box filled with bitter kola that originated from Douala, Cameroon and heading to the United States of America.
