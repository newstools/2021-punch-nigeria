The Federal Government has once again suspended the salaries of 300 workers across various Ministries, Departments and Agencies in the federal civil service over their failure to update their records on the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System. An internal memo marked HCSF/CSO/HRM/137/VOL.1/T6/57 and signed by the Permanent Secretary, Career Management, M. Mamman, on behalf of the Head of Service, Folashade Yemi-Esan, stated that the suspension of other officers, who had failed to update their records on the IPPIS platform, would continue. The memo read, “Officers in the attached list marked as annex two have been suspended on the IPPIS platform for their failure to update their records on the verification portal as earlier requested. “You are to note that this suspension continues in batches for all officers in the core MDAs that failed to carry out the online records update.” Copyright PUNCH.
