Human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), on Saturday, described the reported killing of a teenage trader by bullets reportedly fired by a security agent dispersing Yoruba Nation demonstrators in the Ojota area of Lagos as a case of premeditated murder. Falana also called on the Lagos State Government to conduct a coroner’s inquest into the murder of the girl. He told Sunday PUNCH that while the police violated Section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act 2020 which borders on the provision of adequate security by the security agency for citizens on peaceful rallies and protests, the denial by the Lagos State Police Command was a ploy to shield the killer from prosecution. The senior lawyer said, “The police violated Section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act 2020 which has imposed a legal obligation on the police to provide adequate security for citizens who embark on peaceful rallies and protests. Since the police had illegally dispersed  the peaceful rally with cannisters of teargas, the shooting of the 14-year-old trader by the police was premeditated murder. “The denial of the cold murder of the trader by the police is a diversionary ploy to shield the actual culprit from prosecution. In view of the hasty denial of the police in the dastardly act, we call on the Lagos State Government to ensure that a coroner’s inquest is conducted into the reckless killing of the teenager.” Copyright PUNCH.
