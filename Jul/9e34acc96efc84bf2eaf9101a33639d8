The management of Bowen University, Iwo, has said the institution in the last 20 years of its existence had produced over 13,000 graduates in different discipline. Reeling out achievements of the institution in the last 20 years at a press briefing held on the campus of the university in Iwo on Monday, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Joshua Ogunwole, said the institution had recorded sustained growth amidst daunting challenges. Ogunwole, who was represented by  the Deputy Vice Chancellor Academics, Prof. Ebenezer Atobatele, said TETFUND should be extended to scholars in private universities to develop their capacity for research in the interest of the generality of the people. He said, “We have graduated over 13,000 students in 20 years of our existence since we take off in year 2001 as the fourth private university that would be licensed in the country, though academic activities started in year 2002. “In 2018, our students were rated sixth in terms of employability in the country. We are growing, though amidst challenges of funding amongst others.” “From 508 students when academic activities commenced 19 years ago, we have grown and we are still growing. What we see today as campus was thick forest. But we have since improved that to present standard. “In another 20 years, we have vision to be among the leading universities in the country in terms of research and building of future God fearing leaders.” Copyright PUNCH.
