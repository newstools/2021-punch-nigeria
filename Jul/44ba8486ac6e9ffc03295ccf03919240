Some technology experts have urged organisations to utilise digital disruption to drive their business growth. The experts spoke at the NerdsUnite, a flagship virtual tech programme organised by MainOne recently. They urged organisations to take full advantage of the ever-evolving Information and Communications Technology landscape, especially in the light of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Managing Director, MainOne, Funke Opeke, said that digital disruption was the change that occurs when digital technologies and business models affect the value proposition of existing goods and services. According to her, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a new era in the application of ICT to business. Opeke said the major cause of digital disruption was the rapid advancement of technology and globalisation, which allows new business models to be introduced at an ever-increasing rate and with rapidly declining costs of adopting technology, the COVID-19 pandemic, improved technology innovation, growth in broadband penetration, millennials ease with digital platforms, growth in social media, growth in mobile penetration and the shift to work from home. Also speaking of disruptions in the business space, Founder and Group Managing Director, Interswitch Limited, Mr Mitchell Elegbe, said that organisations must start to think of the traps and triggers on their digital transformation journey. He said traps were pitfalls businesses could face, adding that triggers were the internal and external factors that defined the type of technology to be adopted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
