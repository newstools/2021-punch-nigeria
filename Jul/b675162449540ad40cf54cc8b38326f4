A prominent Nigerian lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), on Tuesday commended the Senate for rejecting Lauretta Onochie, Senior Special Assistant to the President on social media as National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission to represent South South. According to him, 65-year-old Onochie had fervently and publicly denied being politically partisan during the Senate screening. Ozekhome said this in a statement titled, ‘Senate’s rejection of Lauretta Onochie: A refreshing act of patriotism,’ emphasising that clearing her would have been “the biggest liability to this already baggaged government; and further polluted the electoral process.” He said, “Whether for reason of federal character (section 14 of the Constitution), or for the reason of her well-known unabashed partisanship, the important thing is that Onochie was roundly rejected. “Like some people would say jocularly, whether it was Jonah that swallowed the fish, or it was the fish that swallowed Jonah, the important thing is that there was a ‘swallow.’ “Onochie has always used the social media outlet to attack every and all Nigerians that dared to disagree with her mentor and deity, Buhari. She abuses them all. Freely. She deploys obscene expletives, caustic language, utmost vulgarity and asinine inanities.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
