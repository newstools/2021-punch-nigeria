The Lagos State Government on Tuesday said civil servants in the state were being watched those that were good ambassadors of the state for proper reward. The state Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said this at the opening of a three-day training titled, ‘Improving Productivity in the 21st Century Public Service,’ for officers on Grade levels 1 to 12 in Alausa, Ikeja. Muri-Okunola, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mr Samson Ajibade, added that 21st Century public servants should be more productive. He said, “To be frank with you, we did learn and relearn, hence the reason we came up with the training to be anchored by former Permanent Secretary and seasoned facilitators, who are capable. “They were part of the system and are still very much with us, they know and will teach you all that will make you a productive public servant in the 21st century, which is why we went for those we know will teach you all the needed and added knowledge that will make all the participants exceptional.” Muri-Okunola advised the participants to make the workshop participatory and interactive, adding, “You are being watched; be a good ambassador of the public service office. Ensure you contribute meaningfully to the system.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
