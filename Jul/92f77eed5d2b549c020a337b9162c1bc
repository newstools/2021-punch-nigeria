The Upper Area Court Zuba in Abuja has issued a criminal summons against the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and factional candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Charles Soludo, over a criminal complaint brought before it by one Oliver Bitrus. In the processes seen by our correspondent, Bitrus alleges “serial abuse of office and breach of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers by the defendant, while he held office as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria between May 29, 2004, to May 29, 2009. Bitrus alleged, “Between the period the defendant held office as a Public Officer he flagrantly breached the Code of Conduct for Public Officer by buying or acquiring interest in a property known and described as No. 50 Brondesbury Park, London, NW6 7AT, United Kingdom.” He also alleged that the property was acquired using a proxy known as Universal Energy Company Limited and that the purchase price £2,150,000 was paid in a single tranche on October 20, 2006 which was not fairly attributable to his income as the Governor of CBN at the material time.
