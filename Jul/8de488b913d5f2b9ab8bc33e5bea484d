The Theater Arts and Motion Pictures Practitioners’ Association has summoned Yomi Fabiyi over his recently released movie, ‘Oko Iyabo’. The association made this known on Monday in a statement titled, ‘”Oko Iyabo” TAMPAN summons Yomi Fabiyi.’ Fabiyi’s movie depicted a real-life case involving a fellow actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, fondly known as Baba Ijesha, who was accused of sexually assaulting a minor. The minor in the case is the foster daughter of comedienne, Princess, and actresses like Iyabo Ojo and Nkechi Blessing had spoken in support of the minor. However, Yomi Fabiyi took sides with Baba Ijesha during the case and released the movie a few days after Baba Ijesha was released on bail. Reacting to the movie, TAMPAN has summoned Fabiyi for questioning on the issue. The statement read, “The TAMPAN Committee on Ethics, Conflict and Resolution wishes to inform the general public that the association has summoned Mr. Yomi Fabiyi who is the Producer/Director of the controversial film titled “OKO IYABO” to appear before it on Thursday 11th July 2021. “This invitation becomes very necessary because of the controversy that the subject matter of his film has generated which is against our ethic and virtue. “Despite that, we realize that the film has sparked off another round of public dissension that may bring polemic against TAMPAN and our good members if we fail to nip the bud of the controversy. “We hereby implore the general public and the parties concerned to please exercise patience as our eminent association is on top of this issue and will certainly ensure fairness and justice.”
