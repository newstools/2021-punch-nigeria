Kingsley Kanu, a brother to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has claimed that his brother’s visa is still in Kenya. The brother disclosed to the United Kingdom Guardian that he had spoken with the IPOB leader a few days before “he went missing.” “I spoke to him on the phone, he was well in Nairobi. His associates said he went out; he didn’t take his documents with him, so he wasn’t planning on going anywhere. Then all of a sudden, we saw him being paraded in handcuffs in Abuja. “It is an extraordinary rendition, aided by Kenyan authorities. “It is an outrage that cannot be allowed to happen. We are holding the Nigerian government and Kenyan government responsible. The British government knows what is happening,” he said, adding that UK officials had made contact with Kanu’s family and legal team. “I am concerned for his well-being because you know how they will treat him,” Kingsley noted. Lawyers for the Kanu family accused the Nigerian government of “state kidnapping” and said he was abducted by Nigerian officials in Kenya and taken to Nigeria against his will. Evidence seen by The Guardian shows that Kanu entered Kenya this year on his British passport on a visa expiring in June. His UK passport remains in Kenya. Kanu, who is being prosecuted on charges of treasonable felony, was rearrested after jumping bail and repatriated to Nigeria on June, 30 2021. There have however been different reports on the location where the IPOB leader was arrested while the Kenya government denied involvement. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
