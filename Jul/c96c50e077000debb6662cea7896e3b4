A coalition of over 70 human rights organisations under the aegis of Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room on Wednesday said the rejection of the confirmation of Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner representing Delta State was respect for rule of law. “There are other qualified indigenes of Delta Stet that would fit into the position as INEC commissioner; so, the Presidency should present another person. The CSOs are not against the person of Onochie because she is a Nigerian, but because she can function elsewhere for Nigeria”, the Convener of NCSSR, Ene Obi, said during a press conference in Abuja. While commending the National Assembly on the decision, the organisation said the President, Major General Muhamamadu Buhari (retd.), should nominate a qualified and non-partisan woman to replace Onochie. Obi said, “Situation Room lauds the Senate’s decision to uphold the Federal Character Principle enshrined in section 14(3) of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution and its adherence to the voice of Nigerians by rejecting Onochie’s nomination.” “Situation Room calls on President Buhari to nominate a qualified and non-partisan woman to replace the nomination of Ms Lauretta Onochie as soon as possible, as the vacancies of INEC National Commissioners still exist. “We also enjoin the National Assembly and all institutions of government to always uphold the tenets of democracy in the discharge of their duties and act in the interest of the Nigerian people at all times.” Copyright PUNCH.
