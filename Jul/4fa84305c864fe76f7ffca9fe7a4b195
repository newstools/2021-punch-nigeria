The President, Nigerian Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, has warned that the federation will no longer issue International Transfer Certificates to players in the Super Eagles B team seeking moves to obscure leagues abroad. Pinnick made this known in Los Angeles on Saturday. “We don’t want to hear you join teams in Cyprus, China or Belarus. We won’t issue ant ITC to you and I’m going to instruct the General Secretary of the federation. You are the pride of the nation now,” Pinnick said, while addressing the Eagles on Saturday, ahead of their clash versus Mexico. “We want to see you join proud footballing clubs in Europe like Villarreal, Lille, Valencia and the likes.” The NFF boss added that as part of efforts to ensure the home-based players were at par with their foreign counterparts, the federation had planned international friendlies in October for the Eagles B team. He said an agreement had been reached for the games to be played at the 73,000 capacity M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, where the Ravens play. “This is the launch pad we are providing for you to showcase your talents,” Pinnick said. “This team (Eagles B) is our pride and we will keep you and monitor you because you are the next big thing in Nigerian football. “In October, we will be flying the team to Baltimore for friendly games against Ghana possibly, Cameroon and Canada, maybe. We will sort that out in the coming weeks. “We will tidy up all the documentations. You will be playing at the 73,000 capacity M&T Bank Stadium.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
