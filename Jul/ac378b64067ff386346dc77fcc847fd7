Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Company has partnered Stears Data, to unveil 2021 Africa Healthcare Report, titled ‘Impact Investing and Healthcare Financing in Africa.’ The founder of Flying Doctors, Dr. Ola Brown, in a statement on Sunday said the report provided a context on the current state of health care in Africa and the gaps in the healthcare value chain. Brown was quoted to have said this during the virtual unveiling of the report. “The report is divided into three sections that look at how much is needed to improve health care provision in Africa, the role of impact investing as a possible solution and what next steps African countries can take to encourage impact investing and healthcare financing on the continent. It also provides insights on the current state of healthcare in Africa, deep dives into the reasons for the deplorable state of healthcare in Africa whilst pinpointing key areas for investment. “To provide quality health care to the people, someone has to pay for it; the government, the patient or an insurance company. In Africa, the insurers, patients, and the government face constraints. No country in the world has achieved universal health care coverage without significant state support,” Brown said. She advocated public-private partnerships in other to achieve universal health coverage in Africa. “The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a light even more harshly on these gaps, and showcased how technology can help in bridging them. Impact Investing, being a more suitable way for financing this technology across the continent, can be introduced into the Africa health care value chain and will create sustainable impact in different ways,” Brown said.
