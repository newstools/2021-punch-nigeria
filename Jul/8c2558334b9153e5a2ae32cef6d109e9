Gunmen, on Thursday night, abducted the regional manager of the Sokoto Rima River Basin Development Authority, Labaran Dandume from his official quarters in Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State. Residents said 10 gunmen stormed Dandume’s quarters few minutes to midnight on Thursday. It was further learnt that the gunmen forced Dandume into a getaway vehicle and zoomed off within 20 minutes of their arrival. The development reportedly caused panic among his neighbours, who subsequently contacted the police. A resident disclosed that “bandits numbering about 10 attacked the staff quarters of SRRBDA in Dutsin-Ma Local Government Area of Katsina State yesterday (Thursday), where they kidnapped the SRRBDA Manager, Labaran Muhammed Dandume.” The spokesman for the Katsina State Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident but did not give details, saying, “Yes, it is true but we have commenced investigation.”. Another resident said the gunmen had yet to make contact with either Dandume’s colleagues or neighbours. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
