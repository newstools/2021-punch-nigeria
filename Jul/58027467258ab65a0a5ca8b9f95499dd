The Athletics Federation of Nigeria dropped Raymond Ekevwo from the team to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics because of his drop in form and lack of competition, The PUNCH has gathered. Ekevwo, who won gold in the men’s 100m at the 2019 African Games in Rabat with a time of 9.96secs in 2019 to qualify for the Olympics, was overlooked in the final selection of athletes for the Games. The AFN picked Divine Oduduru, Enoch Adegoke and Usheoritse Itsekiri as the country’s representatives in the men’s 100m. A source in the AFN, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the matter, told our correspondent that the AFN dropped Ekevwo from the Olympics because of fears he might be injured. “There are fears that he might be injured, that is why they are not taking him to Tokyo. In the two outdoor races he ran this year – last month – he ran 10.26secs in one and 10.34secs in the other, this shows that something is wrong. So, they don’t want to risk it by taking him to Tokyo,” our source said. The PUNCH had reported that Ekevwo and Oduduru failed to show up for the Olympics National Trials at the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos last month. AFN president, Tonobok Okowa, told our correspondent that visa issues prevented Oduduru and Ekevwo from attending the trials.
