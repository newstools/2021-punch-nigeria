The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has stated that trust and accountability in governance are key objectives of his administration in the areas of infrastructure and human capital. A statement on Tuesday said Sanwo-Olu said this during the visit of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, led by its president, Mrs Comfort Eyitayo, to the Lagos House, Ikeja. Sanwo-Olu said, “For us in Lagos State Government and in the public service of the state, we consider our role here, as one of trust. Trust in governance is one of our key objectives here. We believe that we are in a position of trust. “We are in a position where we need to continue to hold ourselves accountable and hold ourselves answerable to the voting public that elected us into office. But more importantly, to be able to hold on to the tenet of ensuring that everything we do, we can account for it; be it infrastructure, financial and human capital.” Eyitayo commended the efforts of the Sanwo-Olu administration in infrastructural development. “It is not surprising that Lagos State is witnessing massive infrastructural development, some already completed and other ongoing projects. You are equally building a state that will be highly connected thereby positioned to become a 21st Century economy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
