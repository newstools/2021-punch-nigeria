Super Eagles strikers Paul Onuachu and Cyriel Dessers will be up against David Okereke in Saturday’s (today) Belgian Super Cup clash when KRC Genk and Club Brugge clash at Jan Breydel Stadium, Saturday PUNCH reports. Club Brugge won the Belgian league title last season while Genk finished runners-up in the league and won the Belgian Cup as well. Brugge have expressed mixed fortunes in pre-season, with three wins, a draw and two losses, scoring nine goals and conceding nine. Onuachu, top scorer in the Belgian topflight league last season with 33 goals, is expected to lead Genk’s attack, just as Dessers is expected to play a role following his impressive run in pre-season with three goal. Okereke, who made three appearances for Brugges in pre-season, was below par last season. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
