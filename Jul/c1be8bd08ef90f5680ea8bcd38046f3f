The Divisional Police Officer, Warewa Police Station in the Obafemi Owode Local Government of Ogun State, CSP Abdulfattah Ogunsanya, has appealed for support from the government and private organisations to improve security on the Long Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and beyond. Speaking during a visit to the Punch Place, headquarters of Punch Nigeria Limited in Ogun State, Ogunsanya said efforts were on to clear criminal hideouts by cutting the bush around the Long Bridge, adding that empowering the division through the donation of vehicles and motorcycles would strengthen the police’s efforts in combating crimes. He said, “We are here to inform the public that a new Divisional Police Officer has arrived to tackle insecurity in the Warewa Division and part of the things we need to strengthen our efforts in combating crime in the division include vehicles and motorcycles. “We want the government and private organisations to help us with that and also assist in establishing three observational posts on the Long Bridge to enable us to adequately monitor activities on the bridge. “We also need the bridge to be lighted up so as to enable our men to see clearly to combat any form of criminality on the bridge. Also, the installation of CCTV cameras and wire mesh on the entire stretch of the bridge will assist in preventing hoodlums from accessing the bridge to perpetrate crime.” “Most importantly, through the efforts of community security outfits in Warewa, we have commenced the cutting of the bush around the bridge. We want the government and private organisations to continue to assist us.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
