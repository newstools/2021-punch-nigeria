A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, Mr Ugbo Iyiriaro, has been kidnapped along Benin-Abraka Road. The incident was said to have occurred between Ugo and Ugboko communities in the Orhionmwon Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that the victim left Benin on Tuesday to attend to an urgent issue before the journey was aborted midway. According to a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Iyiriaro was driving to his Umoghunokhua community with the plan of returning to Benin the same day. The source added that the kidnappers had already made contact with the relatives of the victim and demanded N20m. “He (Iyiriaro) was on his way to his hometown when he was kidnapped. He was expected to come back the same day, but the journey was aborted by daredevil kidnappers. They have already contacted his family and they are demanding N20m ransom for his release,” the source stated. When contacted, the spokesman for the state police command, SP Kontongs Bello, said that he had yet to get the details of the incident. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
