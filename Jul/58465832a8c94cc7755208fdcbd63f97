Bawa, whose address centered on: “EFCC and the Role of the Youth in Curbing Cybercrime,” bemoaned the effects of drug abuse and internet fraud.

According to him, only a patriotic mind will have the capacity to resist and fight corruption in his/her sphere of influence. “EFCC believes that the fight against corruption requires all hands to be on the deck for it to be won. “Therefore, it is within your powers to secure a corruption-free system for Nigeria, if you so desire. “I will urge you to take up this challenge today, as we work together to take Nigeria to greater heights,” the EFCC chairman said. He noted that the failure of Nigerians to stop corruption at the initial stage had made the country to be struggling with its debilitating pain. “As consequences of our lack of proactive response, we are now burdened by dwindling economy, infrastructure problem, ineffective health system, problematic academic system, unemployment and insecurity,” he said.
