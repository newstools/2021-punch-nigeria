Ace actress, Omotunde Adebowale-David, famed for her role as Adaku in the popular sitcom, Jenifa’s Diary, produced by Funke Akindele-Bello, is still mourning her mother whom she is set to bury tomorrow. In an emotional tribute posted on her verified Instagram page, the On-Air Personality turned actress wrote, “Alake mi. Suzanna. Iye tomi. Iye yinka. Iye Bolaji. Mama lolo. AYA OLUYOLE. Tomorrow it all starts… journey of your flesh body goes home. “I know you said I shouldn’t worry but I can’t help myself mami. Come and fry ojojo for me just the way only you can. The way you laugh when I dance for you. And how shy you get when we hug and kiss you
I wish… but I am still thanking God for how much you allowed me love you.” (sic) Two months ago, the actress announced the death of her mother via social media. She wrote, “Lord who am I to question your will but I know I can’t breathe right now……if love could keep you here with me I loved you sooo much… maami.” (sic) Family, friends and fans have taken to the comment section of the post to sympathise with the thespian. Her co-star on Jenifa’s Diary, Uba Michael, who portrays the character of James, simply posted three heart emojis to commiserate with his colleague. Also, her colleague — popular OAP, Gbemi — sent plenty heart emojis to Adebowale-David and wrote “plenty of hugs.” A fan, Janet_Nuworti, wrote, “Rip Ganny, may the God lord protect you and guide you through out this period, we are with you in prayers.” Another fan, @theunstoppable_01, said, “Rest on Mama. God will continually fill you with her smiles @officiallolo1.”
