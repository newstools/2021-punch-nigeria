LEADERS of the North Central Peoples Forum, on Monday, insisted that competence should be paramount in the choice of a successor for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). The group urged political actors across the country against heating up the polity with incendiary statements and actions because Nigeria is the only nation we have. Secretary of the forum, Khaleel Bolaji, said this at a press briefing, in Abuja, on Monday. He advised governors across party lines to promote peaceful coexistence even as they went playing the game of politics. Bolaji said, “There has been this agitation that the presidency should come to the South. This agitation is further dividing the country. We should focus on competence. “For us, we stand for competence. Let’s stop dividing this country. Since 1999, the South has had more years in office as president than the North. We should stop dividing this country. “We should jettison this idea of zoning. Even within the geographical North, the North Central is being shortchanged. The constitution doesn’t recognise zoning of the position of the president. We have the support of our governors. This group was created to fight for the region. “North Central is different from the Middle Belt. There are six geopolitical zones recognised. The Middle Belt is a combination of Northern minorities. But the essence of the group has been defeated. We want to make this clear. “Whatever those who came here before said, doesn’t represent the position of this Forum. Our position is the same. We need to emphasize this. Let’s focus on competence and not on zoning.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
