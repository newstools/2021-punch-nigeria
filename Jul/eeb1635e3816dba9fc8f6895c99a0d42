Registrar of the institute, Mrs Patricia Kalesanwo, made this known in a statement titled, ‘NIJ floats film, television academy’. According to her, the academy would take manpower training in media and communication studies to another level. The statement read, “The academy which commences academic activities from August will offer courses in screen acting, film directing, film sound editing and film editing. “The coming of the academy is in line with NIJ’s pursuit of its dual heritage in academic learning and professional development, and that experienced professionals have already been mobilised to provide cutting edge teaching in the film and media industry generally and Nollywood particularly. “Aside from the rich content and practical sessions, the training comes with internship opportunities in the film and media industry to make its graduates competent and very marketable upon graduation. “The programme is run in collaboration with Ovueta, a film and television company, and will avail students of contemporary content in film and media.
