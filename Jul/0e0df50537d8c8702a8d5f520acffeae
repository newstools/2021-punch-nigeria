The Assistant Health Prefect, Fruitful Ville Montessori School, Oluwadarasimi Odewunmi, has charged pupils on the importance of maintaining healthy habits to build a healthy society. Speaking during a career talk tagged ‘Health and wellness activities for kids; role of children in building healthy society,” Odewunmi said it was pertinent for children to be educated on health awareness. The nine-year-old said, “Educating children on health awareness is important; the moment we stress the importance of healthy habits among children, the more it will be ingrained in their lifestyle as they grow. “I have been taught how to clean the environment, wash my hands regularly, use nose masks and hand sanitisers and the maintenance of social distancing, among others.” Speaking during the event, the Medical Director and Chief Executive Officer, Ikorodu General Hospital, Dr Taiwo Hassan, represented by the Acting Head, Department of Medicine, Dr Sunday Luro, said because children would be adults tomorrow, the journey of achieving a healthy status starts from childhood. He added, “They usually say health is wealth, but wealth is not about owning cars or buildings, it is about the totality of your existence that is in line with you being at peace in all ramifications.
