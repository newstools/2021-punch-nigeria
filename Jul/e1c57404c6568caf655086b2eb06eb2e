No fewer than 10 bandits and two policemen were killed on Saturday when men of the Operation Puff Adder repelled an attack on two police camps in Kundu village, Zungeru, Niger State. It was gathered that several bandits escaped with gunshot injuries and took away some of the corpses of their members. The policemen were said to have foiled an attempt by the bandits to abduct residents of the area and killed over 10 of the hoodlums in the process. Commending the bravery of the security personnel, the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, during a visit to the scene, urged the head of security agencies in the state to be frank and tell him what they needed to end insecurity in the state, promising that he would do anything for them to ensure that Niger was secured. Bello, who sympathised with the men over the loss of two of their colleagues, also congratulated them for the fine job they did, adding that they would be invited to state whatever they needed to help them discharge their duties more effectively. He added that the state government had made arrangements to procure some equipment to combat insecurity, which would arrive soon and be handed to the state police command. Copyright PUNCH.
