Two commercial motorcycle riders have lost their lives after they were swept away by flood in Ondo town, Ondo State, on Tuesday. PUNCH Metro gathered that the flood was from a downpour on Monday night. A source stated that property worth millions of naira in the community was also destroyed by the flood. According to the source, the remains of the deceased were found at the Oka area of the town. He identified one of the victims as Aderemi, the Chairman of the Amalgamated Commercial Motorcycle Riders Association of Nigeria in the Ayeyemi area of the community; the identity of the second victim was unknown as of the time of filing this report. A resident, Mr Jacob Lorim, explained that the community’s bridge was flooded during the downpour, adding that the bad portion of the bridge was not visible. “As the motorcycle riders were passing, they mistakenly passed through the bad side of the bridge and fell into the river. “A search party was organised, only to discover that the two motorcycle riders had died in the water. But one person, who was rescued from the flood, was taken to a hospital for treatment,” he added. The Chairman of the Ondo West Local Government Area, Mr Ebenezer Akinsulire, who confirmed the incident, described it as sad and unfortunate. He noted that the council had written letters to the appropriate authorities concerning the bridge and the community’s bad road. Akinsulire expressed optimism that the road would be put in good shape as soon as the rainy season was over. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
