M-KOPA, a financing platform, is set to fully launch its activities in Nigeria after the success of its pilot test in the Nigerian market. According to TechCrunch, the company has considered the pilot it ran early this year in Nigeria a success and has appointed a Country Head, Babajide Duroshola, a former country head of SafeBoda Nigeria. M-KOPA’s Chief Commercial Officer, Mayur Patel, was quoted as saying, “We’ve been deliberate about finding the right person with a strong track record and in-depth knowledge of the Nigerian tech community to lead our team as we scale up our country operations. “And the milestone coincided with Babajide’s appointment as we look to grow and expand into new regions.” Smartphone financing was a major part of M-KOPA pilot test, and it sold over 20,000 devices in Lagos, its first market. Duroshola said, “My vision as a person and what really typically drives me on a normal day is to help African startups scale and be that person that would help build, set up, get to the point where they’re able to think about their business strategy and how they can plug into the Nigerian space. “What I’m looking to build with M-KOPA is a full credit machine. I want it to become a household name within the Nigerian market space where when people are thinking about pay-as-you-go financing for everyday use cases, M-KOPA is what comes to their mind.” M-KOPA launched in Kenya 10 years ago and the company kicked off a wider pay-as-you-go solar market in the country. Over the years, the company has expanded its offerings to include televisions, fridges, other electronic appliances, and financial services to customers in Kenya and Uganda. Copyright PUNCH.
