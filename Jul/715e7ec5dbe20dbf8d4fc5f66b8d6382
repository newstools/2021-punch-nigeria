United States music producer, Kanye West, has confirmed the release of his new album Donda. The release date of the album was aired during Game 6 of the NBA finals on Tuesday, according to Hollywood Reporters. The announcement, which was revealed via a commercial ad for Beats by Dre headphones, stated that the album will be released on Friday. However, the live-streaming album listening event will be held in Atlanta on July 22, a day before the official release of the album. A listening event will also be streamed live on Apple Music for the new album of the rapper cum gospel musician. The ad for Beats by Dre debuts West’s new song, “No Child Left Behind,” and stars US superstar runner, Sha’Carri Richardson as she ran 100m in slow motion. A tweet by the headphone company revealed that the song was scored and edited by West himself. Richardson took to her verified Instagram page to also announce that another commercial and new song by West will be released tomorrow, ahead of the album launch. She wrote, “There will be up and downs in life, but its important to remember to run your own race. “Love to @beatsbydre and @kanyewest. Thank you for the support. New commercial and new Ye song dropping tomorrow! Donda out on Friday. Let’s go.” The album Donda is named after West’s late mother, who passed on in 2007. Donda reportedly features artistes like Pusha T, Travis Scott, Lil Baby, and Baby Keem. The new album is West’s first full length project after he released Jesus is King in 2019.
