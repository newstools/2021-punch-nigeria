A Sokoto State High Court, on Tuesday, sentenced two officials of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Mainasara Malami and Emmanuel Salihu, to 14 years imprisonment for defrauding four persons of N1.9 million, under the pretence of securing jobs for them. The convicts were convicted for collecting the money to facilitate recruitment into NSCDC. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the charges were instituted against the officials by Economic and Financial Crimes Commissions, while the case was first mentioned on 20 September, 2018. In his judgment, Justice Malami DogonDaji, said that the prosecution, led by Saâ€™ad Hannafi, charged both men of criminal conspiracy and obtaining money under false pretence levelled against the convicts beyond doubt. He said that the charges contravened some sections of Advance Fee Fraud and Fraud-related Offences Act, 2006. The judge said that he considered the plea of leniency by the convicts on grounds of having dependants and with no such records. He, therefore, sentenced them to seven years imprisonment each on each count charge, without options of fine. DogonDaji also ordered the convicts to refund the N1.9 million collected to the four rightful owners who were the victims of the fraud. He, however, said that the jail term should begin from the date the convicts were arrested by EFCC. (NAN)
