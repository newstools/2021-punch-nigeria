Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers on Tuesday stormed the Kulum Quarry Road off Ibadan-Ijebu Ode Road and abducted three persons. It was gathered that the gunmen abducted their victims from a Toyota Sienna Bus and whisked them away into the bush. However, some persons who saw how the three persons were kidnapped were said to have reported the incident to the police. Some armed policemen, hunters and vigilantes were said to have moved into the bush and combed everywhere in search of the victims and their abductors. The effort was said to have paid off when the security agents and the non-state actors closed in on the criminals. They were said to have abandoned their victims and took to their heels to avoid being arrested or killed by the security agents. The three victims were brought out from the bush unhurt. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Mr Adewale Osifeso, when contacted confirmed the incident to our correspondent in a chat. It read, “On 29/06/2021 at about 1100hrs hoodlums numbering about 10 blocked Kulum Quarry Rd off Ibadan-Ijebu Ode Road. During the process, three people were abducted from a Sienna Bus with Reg No: LUY 835KV. “The process was, however, thwarted by the swift intervention of policemen from the command in concerted efforts with vigilantes and hunters who engaged the abductors and were able to rescue all three victims unhurt. Efforts are ongoing to apprehend the abductors.”
