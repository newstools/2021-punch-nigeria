Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State has been charged to urgently resolve the looming party leadership crisis in the state ahead of the various congresses of the All Progressives Congress in the state. This was contained in a press statement jointly signed by the Caretaker Chairman, Mohammed Imam; and the Secretary, Mohammed Liman issued on Sunday in Minna. The statement said after one year of his appointment as the chairman of North Central Caretaker Committee, the governor has failed to reconcile warring leaders in the party and ensure all lingering cases against the party and its officials pending in courts are withdrawn as directed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). The statement partly read, “We observed that there is a deliberate attempt to sideline Engineer Imam-led executive of the party as several meetings were called and resolutions taken without recourse to his leadership but instead, the zonal chairman (Zone B) and assistant state youth leader were commissioned at a meeting held in Government House recently, contrary to the provisions of the party Constitution. “The illegalities may be challenged in a law court as  they will have far-reaching effect on the party in the state after 2023 general elections akin to what happened to APC in Zamfara state after 2019 election where APC lost all the elective positions in the state due to non-resolution of leadership crisis in that state.” They warned that their lawyers have already been instructed to commence legal actions against some of the illegalities going on in the party in Niger State and added that in line with implications highlighted earlier, any activity of the party carry out without recourse to Imam’s leadership, who is the substantive caretaker chairman of the party, will be illegal and void and liable to be challenged in the law court.
