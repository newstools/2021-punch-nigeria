Gold medallist in the football event of the Atlanta ‘96 Olympics and former Super Eagles assistant coach Emmanuel Amuneke said any of Team Nigeria athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics can spring a surprise and win a medal for the country. In a chat with our correspondent, Amuneke said the U-23 team, which won gold for Nigeria in 1996, were not given any chance, but they shocked the world to emerge victorious. “Our chances are bright, the good thing is that apart from football, we have other athletes that are going to participate in the Olympics. But the reality is that it depends on the level of preparation because other countries also have prepared their athletes and they would also be in a position to compete. “But we just have to be confident in our athletes and those representing us have to believe in themselves. There’s the possibility of doing something for themselves. In 1996, nobody expected that Nigeria would win the football gold medal, this was also the same with Chioma Ajunwa, who also won a gold medal. So, there’s hope and there’s a possibility, but it all depends on the level of preparation and the level of confidence,” Amuneke told SUNDAY PUNCH. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
