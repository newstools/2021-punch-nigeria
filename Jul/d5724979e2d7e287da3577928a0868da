A paralysed Lagos trader, Ndukwe Ekekwe has said that the N7.5 million compensation offered by the Lagos SARS panel was small compared to the damage done to his life. Ndukwe was thrown down a two-storey building by men of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad. He survived the fall but became paralysed.
