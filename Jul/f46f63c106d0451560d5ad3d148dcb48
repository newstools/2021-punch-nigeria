The Ilaje League of Professionals has honoured the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Mr Lucky Orimisan, at a grand reception in Lagos. The group disclosed this in a statement, describing Orimisan as the first indigene to have a successful career and become a deputy governor of the state. The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, commended Orimisan and the professional group for their contribution to the region and the economy at large. He also assured the group of good governance and the continued development of the state. The Chairman, Ilaje League of Professionals, Mr Benson Obayelu, said this was the first time in the 45-year history of Ondo State that the Ilaje linguistic group was producing a deputy governor. According to him, ILP has been in existence for over a decade and is a group of like-minded indigenes of Ilaje Local Government that has as its focus the fostering of the critical alliance towards the realisation of sustainable development in Ilaje communities. “We must remark that we have made some modest marks thus far in respect of our goals but there is always a gulf to fill when developmental issues are under consideration,” he said.
