A young man who identified himself as King of Madness has been arrested and paraded by the Lagos State Police Command. Speaking to The PUNCH during the parade, the young man stated that landing at the police command is something he finds hard to believe. He said he was arrested after some policemen stopped the Uber ride he had boarded on his way to a show at Lekki around 10.45pm. When asked why he was brought to the command, King of Madness said, “I still don’t know. “They told me that I was being taken to meet a DPO. I just saw myself here this morning. I still don’t understand what’s happening.” He stated that no incriminating material was found on him, adding that the policemen gave him permission to make a video while they were frisking him. “My identity looks like that of a criminal, but I’m an artiste, not a cultist,” King of Madness said as he took off his shirt to reveal his body covered in tattoos. He continued, “My mummy used to tell me that there’s a way a book will be too dirty that you won’t be able to touch it let alone identify its content. “They are judging me by my appearance.” He added that he was arrested alone while the Uber driver was allowed to go.
