Ukasha Rabiu Magama, Toro LGA Bauchi State, Ukasharabiu95@gmail.com: The massive failure recorded in the just concluded Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination is the worst ever in the history of the exam, based on the people’s analysis so far. The situation is worrisome to the extent that parents have started blaming the examination conduct and not the candidates performances. Imagine, candidates got 16, 24, 54, 104, 156, with few others getting the average mark of 180 and above. This has generated a lot controversies in many communities. The failure was attributed to the Computer Based Test system by many people, saying most of the candidates who sat for the examination aren’t computer literate and lacked proper orientation on how to operate the computers. Also, others are of the opinion that the long COVID-19 break had great impact on the failure. But to me, this isn’t just the case, rather, the nature of the nation’s education system is responsible. We are aware of the fact that Nigeria’s education sector is suffering from all angles, ranging from infrastructure and poor teachers. In fact,  quality education is not there in Nigeria’s institutions. This has contributed to students’ failure in many ways during exams, because they are not taught what they are supposed to be taught properly.
