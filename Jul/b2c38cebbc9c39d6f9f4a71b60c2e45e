The Lagos State Government has said no fewer than 300 youth agripreneurs from its Lagos Agripreneurship Programme and the Agricultural Youth Empowerment Scheme will be empowered on Thursday. The government said the youths would be empowered at the 2021 Agricultural Value Chains Empowerment Programme on Thursday. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, made this known in a statement on Sunday, noting that this year’s empowerment programme was to create an enabling environment for youths in the field of agriculture. She said, “We have a total of 300 participants out of which 240 is for aquaculture and 60 for poultry. Out of the 240 going for aquaculture, we will have about 80 in the facility in Araga, Epe while the remaining 160 will be at the Lagos Food Production Center, Avia, Badagry.” Olusanya said the mandate of the present administration was focused on empowering youths in the state through agriculture and technology. “Under the mandate of Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, we felt it imperative that we could not keep training people and pushing them out into the market to fend for themselves; we need to give them the mentorship and resources to help them stand on their own.” Copyright PUNCH.
