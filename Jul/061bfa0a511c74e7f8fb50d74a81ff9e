The Rotary Club of Ikeja, District 9110, has inducted its new president, Gbenga Badejo, to serve for 2021/2022 of the Rotary year. Badejo’s investiture as the 54th president of the club was held on Sunday along with the board of directors in Ikeja. Some of the dignitaries present were the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat, who was represented by Aina Oluwagbemiga; Dorothy Ufot (SAN); Akinla of Erin Ijesha, Oba Isaac Ayeni; and Ebumawe of Ago Iwoye, Oba Abdul-Razaq. In his speech, Hamzat congratulated the new president and commended the efforts of the Rotary Club in Lagos state. “I congratulate the new president and also outgoing president for ensuring that the objective of this club is sustained. Lagos State as a whole has been one of the most obvious beneficiaries of the activities of the Rotary Club in Nigeria and this is something worthy of emulation that all organisations should strive to do. “The members have inaugurated various projects such as renovation of schools, construction of community health centres, sinking of boreholes, bearing of medical expenses, among others. These are well appreciated by the administration of Babajide Sanwo-Olu.” Badejo, in his inaugural address unveiled his plans for the Rotary year. He said, “We have mandated all Rotarians to focus on primary schools because education is the foundation and the focus of all understanding. We serve to change lives and that is why we have identified projects that will change lives; we have evaluated them and made analysis and we have decided to raise a minimum of N50m. “We are in discussion with the Lagos State Government to build a youth and children centre in Ikeja, as well as build an ICT centre.” Copyright PUNCH.
