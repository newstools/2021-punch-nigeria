Oghenekaro Etebo admits he is unsure whether he will be at English Championship club, Stoke City, next season, The PUNCH reports. Etebo played on loan for Turkish Super Lig giants Galatasaray, helping Fathi Terim’s side finish second last season. The 25-year-old midfielder made 29 appearances across all competition for the Turkish side, who play PSV Eindhoven over two legs in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers. “It was a good experience for me playing for one of the biggest teams in Turkey last season,” Etebo told The PUNCH. “For now, I have to return to Stoke City for pre-season because I have a contract with them and we see how it goes. I can’t decide that now because I still have to speak with the coach before making a decision on my future. “I don’t know if I will be back at Galatasaray for next season or join a new team. The window is still open and anything can still happen.” The combative midfielder also rued Galatasaray missing out on the Turkish Super Lig title last season. Besiktas won the Turkish Super Lig for the 16th time in their history after they recorded a 2-1 win away to Goztepe on the final day of the season on goal difference ahead of their Istanbul rivals Galatasaray in a tense end to the season. Besiktas’s goal difference of +45 was one better than their rivals. “It was very painful missing out on the title on the final day of the season just on goal difference,” he said. “I felt really bad because we gave it our best to become champions but it was never meant to happen.” Galatasaray paid Stoke City €675,000 as loan fee for the Nigeria international last season, according to Transfermarkt.
