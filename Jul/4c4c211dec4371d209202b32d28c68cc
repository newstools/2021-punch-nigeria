No fewer than three persons were reportedly killed, while scores were injured during a clash between the Boku and Doko communities in the Lavun Local Government Area of Niger State. The dispute, which was connected to the 50-year land dispute between the two communities, broke out last Thursday with an attack by Doko people against the Boku, who are less populated. It was gathered that several houses and vehicles belonging to the Boku people were burnt down, while many livestock were stolen as well as money. A resident of Boku, Mohammed Alikali, said two persons died of gunshot wounds on the spot, while the third person passed away at the Federal Medical Centre, Bida. It was gathered that properties belonging to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria in the village as well as N2m meant to repay loans were burnt. Alikali lamented that the village was deserted as residents had taken refuge in neighbouring villages, adding that since the incident occurred, no government official or elected representatives had paid a sympathy visit to the community. It was learnt that and Chairman of the Niger State Council of Traditional Rulers and the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, had made several efforts to resolve the dispute to no avail. The state Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, confirmed the incident and added that normalcy had been restored in the affected area, while investigation was ongoing to identify and apprehend the perpetrators for prosecution.
