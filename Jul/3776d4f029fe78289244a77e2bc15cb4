…urges security to create farmer-friendly environment The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) on Tuesday expressed sadness over the small portion of arable land being cultivated in the country while urging more Nigerians to embrace farming. The President said this while addressing newsmen after the Eid-el-Kabir prayers, in his country home in Daura, Katsina State, on Tuesday. This was contained in a statement titled ‘I Was Surprised to Hear Only 2.5 Per Cent Of Arable Land In Nigeria Is Being Cultivated, Says President Buhari’, signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, According to him, the Presidential Economic Advisory Council had notified him that only 2.5 per cent of arable lands in the country had been used for farming. He also acknowledged that the low agricultural land use is closely linked to the spate of insecurity in various parts of the country. He, therefore, directed security outfits to work more with communities to create a more friendly environment for farmers. He mandated security agencies to be more relentless in maintaining peace in the country, and ensure a more harmonious relationship with communities so that they can glean intelligence. Buhari noted that the security situation had improved considerably in the North East and South-South, and efforts are ongoing to ensure the same in North Central and North West. He assured Nigerians that more will be done to fish out those that had been troubling the peace of the nation and its citizens. Also at the prayer ground, the Emir of Daura, Faruk Faruk, called on citizens to be more supportive of the President so that he can actualise his vision of improving security and boosting the economy. “Since the President came into power, we have seen some positive changes in the country. “May God continue to strengthen the President with good health and courage to bring peace to the country. God will not allow Nigeria to see shame,’’ he said.
