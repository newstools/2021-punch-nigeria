A businessman, Paul Ozigbo, has been arraigned before the Federal High Court, Abuja, for allegedly forging the signature of his late father, Hillary Ozigbu, in order to change the directors of Ozigbu Engineering Nigeria Limited. In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/239/2020, the Nigeria Police Force also charged Paul with conspiring with others at large to obtain money to the tune of N10.4bn, forging documents of the Corporate Affairs Commission, and converting family property to personal use. Paul, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The defendant had earlier been arraigned before Justice Okon Abang. However, due to the transfer of Justice Abang to another judicial division of the court, the matter started afresh before Justice Donatus Okorowo. Paul’s counsel, Hope Ejiofor, prayed the court to allow his client to enjoy the same bail terms earlier granted and perfected before Justice Abang. The prosecution counsel, I. Nwandike, did not object to the application. The court adjourned the matter till October 18 for trial. In another development, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja has convicted and sentenced a hairstylist, Energy Dennis, to five months’ imprisonment for obtaining the sum of $110 (N45, 210) from an American under false pretences. Dennis, aka Baba Dayo, was arraigned for contravening the provisions of Section 320(a) of the Penal Code Law. He was accused of posing as a spiritualist and defrauding the victim, identified only as Monica. Justice A. O. Musa sentenced him to five months’ imprisonment with the option of N20,000 fine. The court also ordered him to refund the victim. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
