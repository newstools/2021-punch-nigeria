The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Thursday named the State’s Printing Corporation Press Hall after the late former governor of the state, Alhaji Lateef Jakande. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, announced this, noting that Jakande’s feat transcended several areas in the state. He said, “The press hall was named after Jakande because of his laudable achievement in Lagos which is unrivalled. One aspect of Jakande that people had not really celebrated was his exploit in the field of journalism; he started as a proof reader before graduating to becoming an editor.” The General Manager, Lagos Printing Corporation, Kolawole Peregrino, Jakande built the Lagos Printing Corporation in 1980, adding that such motivated the corporation to immortalise him. Meanwhile, Sanwo-Olu also on Thursday appointed an accountant, Sir David Sunmoni, as the new Pro-chancellor and chairman of the reconstituted Governing Council of the Lagos State University. According to a statement on Thursday, Sanwo-Olu appointed Sunmoni with 12 other returned officials who served in the previous council at the Lagos House in Alausa, Ikeja. The statement quoted Sanwo-Olu as saying,  “The inauguration of new Governing Council for the Lagos State University signals a new chapter of progress and resolution of issues surrounding the appointment of a substantive Vice Chancellor for the university. As the supreme governing authority of the university, I charge you to give top priority to implementation of quality policies and programmes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
