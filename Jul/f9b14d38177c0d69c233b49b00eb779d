Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday  Dare, says Team Nigeria is in Tokyo to win medals at the 2020 Olympic Games. Dare stated this at a brief ceremony organised by Ethiopian Airlines at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja before the minister and the Nigerian contingent departed for Tokyo on Tuesday. Dare said, “We are grateful to the Federal Government, Corporate Nigeria and all those who supported Team Nigeria by adopting our athletes. I want Nigerians to wish Team Nigeria the very best as we compete with the very best in the world at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics; 205 countries with over 11,000 athletes from around the world validates the Olympics as the biggest sporting event in the world. The fact that we have a team of 58 athletes that qualified to participate, some of whom  are the very best in their events, shows that this country is going to Tokyo not just to show up but to compete clean and win medals” The minister added, “We thank Ethiopian Airlines for successfully airlifting our team and hope that we shall have cause to celebrate when we return with medals. So, my message is: best wishes Team Nigeria, above all we need  the prayers of Nigerians so that the athletes compete excellently, clean, win medals and bring glory to our nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
