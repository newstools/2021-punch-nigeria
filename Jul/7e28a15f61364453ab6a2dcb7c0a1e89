VICTOR Moses and his Spartak Moscow teammates will face Benfica in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. The draws for the qualifying games was held in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday. Super Eagles duo Paul Onuachu and Cyriel Dessers’s Genk will square up against Shakhtar Donetsk, while Joe Aribo and Leon Balogun, who play for Glasgow Rangers, will have to wait for the winners between Malmo and HJK Helsinki. Celtic also await either Valentine Ozornwafor and Jesse Sekidika’s Galatasaray or Frank Onyeka’s Midtjylland, while Monaco take on either Rapid Vienna or Sparta Prague. Winners of the third qualifying round will progress to the play-off round, while losers will drop to the Europa League play-off. Meanwhile, Moses said he was looking forward to the start of the Russian league side this weekend. “Great preseason done! Feeling fit and strong. Time to focus on the first league game this weekend now. Can’t wait,” Moses tweeted. The Nigerian joined Spartak on a permanent deal after spending last season on loan from Chelsea. Copyright PUNCH.
