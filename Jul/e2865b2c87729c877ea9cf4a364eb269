A group based abroad, Yoruba UK Governing Body, has urged the German Ambassador in Cotonou, Hans-Jorg Neumann, to stop the Governments of Benin Republic and Nigeria from extraditing Yoruba Nation activist Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho to the office of the Department of State Services in Abuja. The group stated this on Tuesday in a letter co-signed by its Executive Council Chief Officer, Adebayo Odusanya; and its Independent Council Chief Officer, Isaac Okebiorunkosi. The letter was titled, ‘Re: Urgent help for German resident innocently arrested abroad’. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Federal Government of Nigeria through INTERPOL got Igboho and his wife, Ropo, who is a German citizen, arrested on Monday night at an airport in Benin Republic, one of Nigeria’s neighbouring countries in the West African sub-region. Igboho was arrested while he tried to catch a flight to Germany with his wife. However, reacting in the letter obtained by The PUNCH, the group said, “We seek urgent help from the German government and the German Embassy at the Republic du Benin where he was arrested on 19 July 2021 to prevent his extradition to Nigeria. Mr Adeyemo has his family based in Germany and this action against him is against his fundamental human rights and will result in traumatising them. “Evidence demonstrates that the present government of Nigeria has no respect for the rule of law and are highly likely to dehumanise him as they are known to do. Mr Adeyemo is an activist for fair treatment for his native Yoruba people who are being continually killed, maimed, have their wives and women raped and their farms and properties destroyed. “We, therefore, beseech you to take this matter forwards with the urgency and gravity required of the situation.”
