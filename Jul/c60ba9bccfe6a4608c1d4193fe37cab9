The Department of State Services has barred human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, from seeing the five youths who were arrested at Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Abuja on Sunday for wearing shirts that bore the inscription, ‘Buhari Must Go’. Effiong, who is one of the lawyers representing the youths, said this in a Facebook post on Wednesday. He wrote, “I just left the headquarters of the State Security Service in Abuja. I requested access to the five activists who were arrested on Sunday at Dunamis International Gospel Centre for wearing ‘Buhari Must Go T-shirts to the church. I was not given access to them. We have a long way to go as a country.” The Spokesman for the DSS, Peter Afunaya, has refused to comment on the matter since the arrest of the five youths on Sunday. A text message sent to him on Wednesday was not responded to as of press time. In a statement earlier on Wednesday, the church said it had no hand in the arrest of the five youths, adding that it was undercover DSS officials at the church that did so. The five youths were arrested on their way out of the church.
