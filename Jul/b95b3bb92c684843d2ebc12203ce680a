The Federal Government has ordered local and international airline operators to compensate passengers for flight delays. Part of the compensation includes the provision of hotel accommodation and refreshments. This was disclosed in a statement containing the highlights of a State House press briefing by the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, shared on the verified Facebook account of the Federal Government on Thursday. The statement read, “Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika reiterates Federal Government orders on airline flight delays. “Local & international airlines must provide refreshment and communicate to passengers via call/SMS for flight delays within one hour; reimburse full ticket fares to customers for flight delays more than two hours; and provide hotel accommodation, refreshment, meal, to-and-fro hotel transportation, and communicate to passengers via calls, SMS and email for delays between 10pm and 4am.” The PUNCH earlier reported that airline operators justified the delay and cancellations of domestic flights in the country. They based the reason on the non-availability of aviation fuel and its rising cost, inadequate parking spaces at airports, non-availability of forex for spare parts and maintenance, sudden change of weather, delay due to VIP movement and others. This is according to the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, who led the operators when they appeared before the Senate Committee on Aviation chaired by Senator Smart Adeyemi on Tuesday.
