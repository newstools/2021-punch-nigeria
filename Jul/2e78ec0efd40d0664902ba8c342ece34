The Lagos State Government will be partnering the Lagos Commodities and Futures Exchange in raising $2bn for food security by floating agricultural commodities notes. The LCFE said in a statement that top officials from LASG held stakeholder engagements with its management in a bid to fund the states’ agricultural goals. The Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Bagola Olusanya, was quoted as saying that LASG aimed to end food scarcity by injecting more capital into agriculture as part of the state’s five-year roadmap. She said a large expanse of land had been developed to create central logistics as hubs in key locations of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
