The Lagos State Government has said developing the capacities of directors in government parastatals is key to efficient service delivery. The Special Adviser, Parastatals Monitoring Office, Mr Afolabi Ayantayo, said this during a one-day workshop for directors of Administration and Human Resources at the State Treasury Office Resource Centre, Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “Looking at the Parastatals Monitoring Office under this administration, the emphasis has been on development of templates that would enhance effective and efficient service delivery. To achieve this, the training and retraining of the workforce have been the focus of our office.” Ayantayo stated that the present administration of Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu was focused on good performance and the exposure of the state workforce to contemporary management approaches will enhance employee productivity. “It is no overstatement to say that as parastatals, you have role to play in the actualisation of the THEMES agenda of the present administration. Your assignments call for equipping you with the desired knowledge and skills that will enable you enhance efficiency and increase output,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
