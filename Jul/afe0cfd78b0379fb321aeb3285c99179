The Lagos State Safety Commission in conjunction with Lagos Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget has organised safety survey of vocational institutions and entrepreneurship centres in Lagos. The Director General, LSSC, Mr Lanre Mojola, made this known on Saturday. He said, “Once our youths have one or two training on vocational training, they will be employers of labour within a year or two. Hence our decision to team up with Lagos Bureau of Statistics to take a safety survey and have the safety data of the vocational institutions.” Mojola stated that vocational training programmes would help youths contribute to the economic growth of the state, aside being self-reliant and employers of labour. “The vocational and entrepreneurship training engage youths in activities that will make them contribute to the socio-economic development of the society and shun vices capable of undermining the development efforts of the state government. “Our job is based on data and it is also scientific. All the various vocational training by the present administration must be in tandem with the security and governance pillar of the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of the government,” he added. Similarly, the Deputy Director, LBS, Baruwa Basit, who represented his director, Mr Tayo Oseni-Ope, explained that the survey was important for the purpose of safety. Copyright PUNCH.
