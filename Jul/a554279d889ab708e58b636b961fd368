An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State on Friday remanded a 13-year-old boy (name withheld) in a correctional home, for allegedly defiling an 11-year-old girl. The Magistrate, Ejiro Kubeinje, who did not take the juvenile’s plea, directed the police to send the case file to the state Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. She adjourned the case until August 17 pending legal advice from the DPP’s office. The Prosecution Counsel, Bisi Ogunleye, told the court that the defendant committed the offence in March at his residence. He said that the defendant unlawfully had sexual intercourse with the girl. Ogunleye said, “After he had satisfied his sexual urge, he released her. “The girl cried to her mother and told her what the defendant did to her. “The parent of the girl reported the case to the police, leading to the arrest of the defendant.” The prosecutor said that the offence violated section 27(1) of the Child Rights Law of Lagos State, 2015.
