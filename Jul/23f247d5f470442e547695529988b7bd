The family of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, on Tuesday insisted on explanations on how their son was allegedly “abuducted and bundled” back to Nigeria. This demand came as traditional rulers under the aegis of Monarchs of Biafran Land came to Umuahia on solidarity visit and advised the Federal Government to use dialogue in handling Kanu’s matter. Speaking during the occasion, Kanu’s younger brother, Emmanuel Kanu, said that the family was still in the dark on how their son was “abducted in Kenya and brought to Nigeria” Emma said the family would not attend any court hearing against Nnamdi unless it was explained to them how their son was “kidnapped in Kenya, and who his abductors were or working for. “We won’t be in court on 26th July until they explain to us how and who kidnapped Nnamdi in Kenya. “We need clarifications on what happened and how he was brought to Nigeria illegally. “Even Britain, whose citizenship he holds, said it needed explanations on what happened. So, we need to know what happened.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
