The Peoples Democratic Party in Adamawa State has said Senator Grace Bent, Board of Trustee member of the party who defected to All Progressives Congress began working against the party following her loss of the senatorial primary ticket ahead of 2019 general elections. Bent, who represented Adamawa Southern Senatorial District, from 2007 to 2011, resigned her membership of the PDP, saying she did so convinced “beyond every reasonable doubt after my 21 years political sojourn in the PDP that it was time to move on by joining the progressives minded people.” However, reacting to the defection of Bent on Sunday, Hamzat Madagali, Adamawa PDP Organising Secretary, said Govenor Ahmadu Fintiri and the party had done everything to placate, Bent, with her nomination and appointment as Board of Trustee member, after she lost her bid for the Senate. Madagali said her exit did not come as a surprise and did not worry the party because she had “no more value to add to the party.” He said, “We refused Senator Bent from hijacking the mandate freely given to her rival in the senatorial primaries; that is her grouse with the party. As far as we are concern in PDP, she has no more value to add to the party. Before, she was a parent bringing value to the party. But immediately she lost out on becoming a senator, she became a parent of destruction. Any parent who goes on a destructive voyage in any organisation cannot be seen to be a person of value to that organisation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
