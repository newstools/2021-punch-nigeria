Nigerian film legend, Richard Moje Damijo, is in high spirits as he would be turning 60 on July 6. In an interview with Chude Jideonwo, the actor mentioned that his life would begin at 60 and that he is particularly grateful for his life as none of his parents ever clocked 60 years old. RMD said, “None of my parents lived to be 60. So, life for me is just about to get started. There’s been a spectre of death around my life; that’s what I’ve been dealing with last year till this year. When I turned 59, that was a big deal for me, big deal for me! My mom died at 59 and my father died at 57/58.” “So, it was like ‘can I break it?’ When people see me and I go on a weight loss, people think that it is health. Both my parents were diabetic and hypertensive; I don’t want to be that. I don’t want to be diabetic and hypertensive; I want to be healthier. At least give myself a fighting chance to change that whole cycle. “Yes, I’m a Christian now; so, I have broken that yoke, but I have to also help myself. Becoming 60 for me is even a bigger deal. So, when July comes and I become 60; you know how the Bible says old things have passed away? I will truly, truly become a new man because, for me, that is when I will make a bucket list. “So, all these things that you think I have achieved or done, for me it is nothing, like zero. My biggest accomplishment for me now is my family. So, I’m going to now sit down when I’m 60 and do a bucket list … and then we’ll start.”
