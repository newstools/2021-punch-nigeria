Rent Small Small, a Nigerian property technology company, has announced the opening of Freedom Park, its first solely-managed residential estate in Awoyaya axis of Lagos. At a tour of the facility, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Rent Small Small, Tunde Balogun, said, “We are happy that more landlords and developers have trusted us with their properties. This is the first time we are taking on an entire newly built estate. “With over 100 apartments, we have a space for young professionals looking for a vibrant community where they can express their independence, creativity, and improve their productivity, which is why we named the estate Freedom Park.” According to Balogun, the park has over 100 brand-new studios/single bedroom apartments available for rent from as low as N50,000 per month. He said in a statement that this was done to provide more people access to affordable decent homes.
