The Federal Government on Thursday approved the appointment of 43 traditional rulers as chancellors and 27 other individuals as pro-chancellors of some federal universities and inter-university centres. The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, who disclosed this during a press briefing in Abuja, said that the decision was in line with the establishment of new universities and also to replace deceased chancellors. He said, “Mr. President has, following the establishment of additional universities, approved the appointment, reassignment of chancellors to 43 federal universities. The exercise is intended to also replace deceased chancellors of some federal universities. “As royal fathers, these chancellors are expected to be the moral compass of the various universities to which they are assigned. They have been taken from their kingdoms and primary constituencies to other kingdoms and these appointments are expected to play a role in cementing relationships between communities in the country. “Let me reiterate that the chancellors shall be presented to the university community at an investiture ceremony to be organised by the university for the purpose; or during the next convocation ceremony when the investiture will precede the conferment of degrees at convocation.” According to Adamu, some of the universities include Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi; Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria; Federal University, Lafia; among others. He noted that governing councils of 13 federal universities were inaugurated early this year. Some of the schools and inter-university centres include: The Nigerian French Language Village, Badagry, University of Benin, University of Nigeria, Nsukka; among others.
