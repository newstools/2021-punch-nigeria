Residents of the Federal Housing Estate II, Salolo, Lagos State have called on the government to come to their aid regarding the illegal sale of the water tank meant to serve the estate. One of the residents said, ”Instead of completing the estate water treatment plant, what we got was a shock when we heard that one Mrs Salami said she had bought the tank for about N250,000.”
