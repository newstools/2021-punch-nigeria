Wema Bank Plc has said it will be rewarding its customers with cash prizes worth N31.5m over a period of nine months, beginning from this month, to appreciate them for their loyalty and patronage. According to a statement on Sunday, as the bank is marking its 76th anniversary, it will fulfil its promise to excite its customers with the commencement of its newly launched reward scheme, called ‘5 for 5’. It said with the reward scheme, some customers would move up the social status ladder as millionaires would emerge in the promo draws that would cover many customers in different locations in the country. It said, “There is a monthly grand prize of N1m for one customer, N100,000 for 20 customers and N10,000 consolation prizes for 50 customers monthly. This gives a total of 71 people getting rewarded each month.” According to the Retail Divisional Head, Wema Bank, Dotun Ifebogun, the scheme is open to new and existing customers. Ifebogun said, “All they need to do to win is fund their accounts with at least N5,000 and carry out a minimum of five transactions on either ALAT, USSD or with their cards, monthly and maintain a minimum account balance of N10,000 at the end of the month. “It is open to new and existing customers and those who reactivate their accounts. To meet those needs, banks need to make customer experience the starting point for process design hence our desire to reward as they transact.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
