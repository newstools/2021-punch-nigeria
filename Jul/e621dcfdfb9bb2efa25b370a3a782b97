The crisis tearing the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has deepened as a faction of the association has decried the occupation of its secretariat by a factional president. Sanusi Fari, IPMAN’s factional national president, stated that he was ejected by a member of the association, Chinedu Okonkwo, and his faction in a letter to the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba. He also accused the police of complicity in the alleged act. Fari said in the petition that according to Article IV of the IPMAN’s revised constitution, he automatically became the national chairman after the three-year tenure of Obasi Lawson. He said his forceful removal from the association’s national secretariat with the alleged complicity of the IGP was a clear violation of the association’s constitution and a Supreme Court ruling of December 14, 2018. He said a pronouncement of the Federal High Court sitting in Calabar decided by Justice Amobeda on 21 February 2019 interpreted the Supreme Court judgment as his victory in accordance with IPMAN’s 1997 constitution and settled the leadership crisis in his favour.
