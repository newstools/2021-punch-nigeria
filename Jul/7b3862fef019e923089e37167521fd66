Veteran Serbia captain Aleksandar Kolarov has extended his Inter Milan contract by another season, the Serie A champions said on Tuesday. “The 35-year-old Serbian defender’s deal now runs until 30 June 2022,” the Italian club said in a statement. Kolarov left Manchester City for Roma in 2017 after winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups in a seven-year spell. The left-back joined Inter from Roma in 2020 on a one-year deal, with an option for a second, for a reported 1.5 million euro ($1.7 million). In total Kolarov played 11 times for Inter who won the Scudetto last term for the first time since 2010. In a season in which he contracted coronavirus, suffered muscular problems and had surgery on a herniated lumbar disc, Kolarov’s last match was an Italian Cup semi-final defeat to Juventus in February. ea/iwd © 1994-2021 Agence France-Presse
