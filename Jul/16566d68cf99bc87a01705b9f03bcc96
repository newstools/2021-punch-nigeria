The Ondo State Security Network Agency also known as Amotekun corps has deployed its newly recruited officers to different locations in the 18 local government areas of the state. The state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, had recently inaugurated over 503 newly recruited officers of corps. According to the corps, no fewer than 400 suspected criminals had been arrested in the first phase of its ‘Operation Clean Up’, which started a few months ago to flush out the criminals from the state. The Commander of the Amotekun Corps, Adetunji Adeleye, stated this during the second phase of ‘Operation Clean Up’, which took place in Akure, the state capital, on Monday evening. He said there is no hiding place for criminals with the commencement of the second phase of the exercise, which was targeted at sweeping out hoodlums. Adeleye said, “We have dispatched our new 500 officers to different locations in the 18 local government areas of the state and with this, more arrests of suspects are expected.” “The first phase of the ‘Operation Clean Up’ was a huge success with the arrest of over 400 suspects which were mostly Okada riders and curfew-defaulters. The other suspects have been charged to court, while some are serving jail terms.” The commander, who led the corps on a show of strength around Akure metropolis on Monday evening, explained that the reason for the show of strength was to scare away criminals with a view to curbing their dastardly acts in the state. He added that the show of strength exercise is also meant to assure the general public that the state is safe and peaceful. The places visited during the show of strength include Alagbaka, the popular NEPA roundabout, the ‘A’ Division Police Station area, Oja Oba, Oba Adesida road Oyemekun Road, Ilesa Garage among others.
