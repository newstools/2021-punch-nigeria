The Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, who was among the 52 senators that voted against the electronic transmission of election results in the 2023 general elections defended his action on Saturday. His defence was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Legislative and Plenary Matters, Efe Duku, titled, “E-Voting And E-transmision Of Election Results: All Is Well” Omo-Agege, described his position on the amendment made to Clause 52(3) of the Electoral (Amendments) Bill 2021, as “a major gain for our democracy.” “It has huge annihilating consequences for historical election rigging in our polity, but we shall not say more for now,” he added. The statement noted that Omo-Agege, in voting yes to the amended clause, was properly guided in all his actions and inactions as a lawmaker. The statement read in part, “He knows that laws once enacted often have far-reaching ramifications, sometimes beyond the lifetime of the legislators who make them. “Distinguished Senator Ovie Omo-Agege did not vote against E-Transmission of election results. “Rather, the Deputy President of the Senate wisely and courageously voted for an amendment to Clause 52(3) of the Bill (on E-Transmission) to guarantee secure E-Transmission of all election results and uniform application of E-Transmission everywhere in the country, not just some parts of it. “In simple terms, The Obarisi of Urhoboland voted to support an amendment that ensures, for example, that INEC does not transmit only election results in Urhobo electronically while other areas may have their results transmitted otherwise and safely. “For him, all election results must be treated equally under a uniformly applied standard.”
