Super Eagles Striker, Victor Osimhen, scored four goals in Napoliâ€™s first pre-season friendly under Luciano Spalletti, crushing local side Anaunia 12-0. He scored scored in eight, 20th, 35 and 37th minutes in the game. The new coach set his team out in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Matteo Politano, Eljif Elmas and Adam Ounas fanning out behind Osimhen. North Macedonia international Elmas got the first goal of the campaign, turning in the Ounas assist. Nigerian striker Osimhen then ran wild with four individual goals, joining with a Kostas Manolas header and Stanislav Lobotka strike to end the first half 7-0. The entire outfield 10 changed after the restart, but the goals continued to flow, with Gennaro Tutino, Amato Ciciretti, Zinedine Machach and Andrea Petagna finding the net. However, Petagna missed several huge opportunities before scoring with the last kick of the game, a tap-in. Machach and Karim Zedadka also rattled the woodwork during the second half. The team was again still wearing the same kit as last season, because the new self-produced jerseys have not yet arrived.
