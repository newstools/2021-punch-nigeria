The Synagogue Church of All Nations has declared that until the elders of the church have their meeting, Mrs Evelyn Joshua, the late Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua’s widow, will be in-charge of coordinating the affairs of the church. The church had dismissed reports that SCOAN was engulfed in a succession tussle between Evelyn and some disciples of the late prophet. But SCOAN in a statement on Thursday said “the sequence of events clearly points to an attempt by some mischief makers to draw the ministry into unnecessary controversies.” The statement reads in part, “Mrs Evelyn Joshua is in a mourning mood, following the burial of her late husband on Friday 9 July, 2021, and as a responsible wife and mother, the least favour she deserves from well-meaning Nigerians is for them to respect the family’s privacy at these trying times. Rather than fan the embers of strife and animosity, she has remained focused on preserving the legacies of her late husband.” The church said every member of SCOAN and Emmanuel TV partners were one, adding that  Evelyn was not in contention with “any person or group of persons over what legally and naturally belongs to her.” “Be informed that at the appropriate time, the new leader of the ministry shall be made known, according to the move of the Holy Spirit. For now, Mrs. Evelyn Joshua is in charge of coordinating the affairs of the church,” the statement added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
