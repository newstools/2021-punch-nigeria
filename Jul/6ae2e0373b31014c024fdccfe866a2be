Former Super Falcons star Stella Mbachu says Nigeria’s men and women’s basketball teams can bring back a medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Mbachu, in a chat with our correspondent, said with the way the teams played in their pre-Olympics games, it showed they had what it took to play among the best in Tokyo. “Although I don’t know many of our athletes because our football teams are not there, I watch the basketball teams and I believe so much in them,” Mbachu said. “I watched D’Tigers’ victory over the USA and the D’Tigress loss to the Americans, they play the way we have not seen our teams or other teams play. I believe with the way they played, if they carry that kind of spirit to the Olympics, they will definitely win a medal.” D’Tigress will face the United States in their opening game of the Olympics at the Saitama Arena in Tokyo on July 27.
