The Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka, has called for the unconditional release of the IPOB leader, Kanu. The fiery Catholic priest made the call in a sermon on Sunday at the adoration ground. Mbaka said he made the request for Kanu’s release when some government agents, whom he did not mention, came calling with juicy offers to him, which he claimed to have turned down. He stated, “Some people came to me some time ago that they had two slots for me. I told them that I didn’t need such an offer, because I had a slot that I needed. They said I should mention what I need. “My first request was that they should release Nnamdi Kanu, because since you people arrested him, we have lost many lives, so of what use is his arrest if after he was arrested kidnapping hasn’t stopped in the North, thus, arresting him doesn’t solve the problem. “Has anyone seen Nnamdi Kanu kill anybody? He’s not a murderer. Have they caught him with guns? So, why arrest him? “Where were the nation’s security agencies when several students were kidnapped?” He urged the government to use the same energy in arresting Kanu to apprehend kidnappers. Mbaka, while attributing the rise in criminality to the activities of politicians who purchase arms for thugs during electioneering, advised the government to use the same vigour deployed in arresting Kanu to arrest insecurity, poverty, unemployment, activities of herdsmen, injustice and pragmatic nepotism.
