Super Eagles goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa has urged Nigerians to support men’s basketball team D’Tigers in their bid to achieve podium finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Beijing 2008 Olympics bronze medallist, in a chat with our correspondent, said D’Tigers had been winning “special games” and was optimistic they would claim a medal in Tokyo. “After the football team failed to qualify for Tokyo 2020, one other sports I picked interest in was basketball. And you can see how they are doing good. I believe all they need is favour,” Ezenwa told Saturday PUNCH. “You might have the best team and you go there and will not be lucky. All Nigerians have to do is to pray for D’Tigers and keep supporting them, they have done very well, they have won some special games and even defeated the US. It is a way to show the world that they are ready. “All they have to do is go there and represent the over 200million Nigerians. I believe with teamwork, they will come back back with a medal from Japan.” The PUNCH reported on Friday that D’Tigers were ranked fourth in the latest FIBA Power Rankings released. The power rankings, which is different from the FIBA World Ranking presented by Nike, is based on the recent performances of the teams. It is determined by dividing the sum of all the win points, tie points, schedule points and bonus points by the number of games played. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
