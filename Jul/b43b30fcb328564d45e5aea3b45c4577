A Lagos Magistrates’ Court sitting in Yaba has ordered the police to get legal advice from the state’s Directorate of Public Prosecutions on whether the Yoruba Nation agitators arrested can be prosecuted or not. The state police command had arrested 47 men and two women on July 3, 2021, during the Yoruba Nation rally at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota. Some of the suspects are Bamidele Akomolafe,  Dauda Abubakare,  Adebanjo Adedayo, Lawal Akeem, Abdulsemiu Akanbi, Emmanuel Chidiemere, Taofeek Abdulsalami,  Adesina Ibrahim, Adeyemi Segun, Abiodun Taiwo, Adagunodo Babatunde, Oluwafemi Adeleye, Oloye Taiwo, Saheed Kareem, Adebayo Waheed, Akinbode Sunday,  Lawal Akeem, Samuel Ire and Ogundile Dare. The police had earlier approached the court to seek an ex parte order to detain the suspects for 21 days, which was granted on July 5, 2021. But human rights lawyers, led by Olasupo Ojo and Oladapo Kayode, had filed a motion for the suspects’ bail application. However, at Monday’s proceedings, the presiding magistrate, Adeola Adedayo, refused to hear the bail application and ordered that the case file be sent to the DPP for legal advice. Adedayo further adjourned the hearing of the bail applications and arraignment of the defendants till July 27. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
