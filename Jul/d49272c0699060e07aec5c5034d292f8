The Federal Government has declared Tuesday and Wednesday as public holiday to mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebration. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, also urged Muslims to  use the period to pray for peace, unity, prosperity and the stability of the country. This was contained in a statement by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Dr Shuaib Belgore, on Thursday. The statement reads in part, “I call on Muslims to continue to imbibe the spirit of love, peace, kindness and sacrifice, as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad and to also use the period to pray for peace, unity, prosperity and the stability of the country, considering the challenges of insecurity we face at the moment. “These mainly are bandits in the North-West and North=Central, insurgents in the North-East, kidnappers, armed robbers, ethnic agitators and sundry criminals in other parts of the country.” The Minister assured Nigerians that the regime of Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)  was committed to the security of lives and property of every Nigerian, empowering the citizens for successful living, providing social investments programmes and adequate security in the schools, especially with the spate of innocent school children being targets of kidnapping.” Copyright PUNCH.
