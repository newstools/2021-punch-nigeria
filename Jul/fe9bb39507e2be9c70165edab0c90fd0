Alvaro Morata’s late equaliser saw Spain force extra time in their Euro 2020 semi-final against Italy at Wembley on Tuesday as the match finished 1-1 after 90 minutes. Federico Chiesa gave Italy the lead with a fine curling strike on the hour mark. But the much-maligned Morata, dropped to the bench for the first time in the tournament, was introduced as a substitute and slotted home with 10 minutes remaining after a neat one-two with Dani Olmo. The winners will face England or Denmark, who play on Wednesday, in Sunday’s final in London. AFP
