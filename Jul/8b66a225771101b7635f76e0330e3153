The Police Service Commission has confirmed the acting appointments of  three Deputy Inspectors- General of Police. They are Tijanni Baba who replaced retired DIG Aminchi Baraya for North East; Zanna Ibrahim, who replaced Ibrahim Larmode (North East) and  Moses Jitoboh who replaced  Ogbizi Michael for South South. The Commission also approved the promotion of 24 Commissioners of Police to the next rank of Assistant Inspectors- General of Police. The PSC, however, declined the promotion of a former acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu. Magu was suspended from office and subsequently sacked following allegations of corruption and insubordination levelled against him by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN. A presidential panel which indicted him recommended his prosecution. But the PSC in a statement on Thursday, disclosed that it declined the promotion of Magu “pending clearance from the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and the Inspector- General of Police.” Similarly, the Commission approved the promotion of 35 Deputy Commissioners of Police to the rank of Commissioner, 52 Assistant Commissioners of Police to Deputy Commissioners and 46 Chief Superintendents of Police to Assistant Commissioners.
