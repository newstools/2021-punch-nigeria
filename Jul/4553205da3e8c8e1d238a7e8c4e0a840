Stakeholders in the education sector have advocated partnership in the development of the country’s education sector. The stakeholders made the submission during the June edition of EdTech Mondays, an initiative put together by Mastercard Foundation in partnership with ccHub Limited. According to a statement on Sunday, the stakeholders said the best approach to advancing the country’s educational system was the Open Educational Resources. According to Wikipedia, Open educational resources are freely accessible, openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching and learning, as well as for research purposes. An edu-tech entrepreneur, Mr Kelechi Uchenna, said parents and teachers could not afford to ignore the significance of Open Educational Resources in the 21st-century learning environment. “There are people who would always want to go to your site and download everything because it is free. It is good to deploy the ‘freemium model’ because EdTech adopters want to taste what you are offering before they pay for it. You cannot stop users from accessing your resources but you can innovate around it,” he said. Also, the Head of Learning and Development, Jobberman, Daniel Emenahor, said the government and policymakers must be at the forefront of promoting interest in the use of Open Educational Resources to advance learning and improving outcomes for both students and teachers. Emenahor, who acknowledged the huge gain attached to adopting OED, explained that more youth need to be encouraged to access online resources for Nigeria’s educational system to fulfil its potentials.
