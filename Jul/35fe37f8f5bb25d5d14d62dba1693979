The Lagos State Waterways Authority has warned boat operators to always observe the weather conditions and ensure their ferries are in good condition before sailing. The General Manager of LASWA, Mr Oluwadamilola Emmanuel, who gave the warning in a statement on Monday, noted the recent heavy downpours in Lagos. He said, “The Lagos State Waterways Authority is once again sending out stern warnings to all ferry operators in the state. Operators and passengers alike must always adhere to safety precautions to avoid any incidence on the waterways. “LASWA is warning all boat operators to frequently observe the weather conditions and ensure their ferries are in good condition before sailing.” He added that LASWA was doubling its regular monitoring and safety compliance efforts on the waterways. The agency had on July 7 commenced her bi-annual boat condition survey across all jetties. Emmanuel said that the exercise was part of efforts to continually guarantee the safety of all waterways users in the state. Last Friday, a passenger boat en route Badagry from Five Cowries Terminal, Ikoyi had malfunctioned while under way amid heavy rainfall on Friday. The 18 passengers in the boat, including children, were, however, successfully evacuated from the craft. Emmanuel confirmed to journalists that all passengers were saved from drowning. “No cause for alarm. All passengers have been successfully rescued while the boat moved to safer harbour till the heavy rain stopped and will be taken to dry dock for technical assessment,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
