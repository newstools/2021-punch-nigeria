The safe to load programme and the associated scheme apply to all trucks that load fuel products and other hazardous products at facilities operated by the major oil companies and ensure all fuel tankers and equipment are fully tested and maintained every six months in line with industry best practice. Ensuring fuel tankers are regularly checked and maintained guarantees safest possible entry, loading and exit at fuel loading facilities. It also ensures safety of commuters and other road users on the highway. A Pass-2-Load inspection should be required for all road tankers that deliver bulk petroleum including prime movers, rigid tankers, tanker trailers, and trucks used to transport bulk petroleum in demountable tanks. Transport companies without a safe load pass for their trucks should not gain access to loading terminals. The checklist for a safe to load programme should look like this or it can be more comprehensive. Driver checklist for loading and unloading procedures before loading transport vehicle (1)Walk around inspections: A driver must conduct a walk around inspection. You must visually check for any unusual odours, noise, or physically defective equipment, such as broken springs, overheated tyres, misalignment of axles, leaks, smoke, etc. Before loading, verify that every compartment is empty. If you load on top of the product, you will be charged with the incident. K-1 Kerosene: If loading K-1 Kerosene, step 2 is important. You are NOT to load K-1 into a compartment that previously contained gasoline. Only load K-1 after a distillate. It is a required practice to drain the compartment of all residual products before loading K-1. Bottom loading procedures (1) Stop delivery vehicles at the loading rack stop line. (2) At the stop line, turn off all lights, radio, and other electrical equipment (and follow any other posted local plant procedures). (a) Check tyres and suspension for broken springs. (3) If the rack is not clear, set parking brakes and shut off the engine. (4) When the rack is clear, start the engine, pull forward and spot the truck for loading. (5) Re-set parking brake. (6) Shut off the engine. (7) Eye protection and bump hat must be worn at all times during the transfer of product. (8) Under NO circumstances should the driver leave the loading area unless due to an emergency. (a) No one other than the driver is to be in the loading area except: (i) An authorised instructor training that driver. (ii) Persons authorised by the oil company who has a legitimate reason to be in that area during the loading process. (b) No driver, while filling his truck, will allow his attention to be diverted from the loading process. (i) Examples of activities which unnecessarily divert attention from the proper focus of the loading process are: (a) Eating or drinking (b) Reading or writing (9) If the truck is equipped, check product retain lights. (a)Connect high level fiber optic cable (ground line/scully cord) to the truck. (b)+Check for permissive green light (c)If the green light does not come on, stop the loading process, see instructions/plant attendant/or supervisor. (10) Connect the vapour recovery hose and close both cam-lock (“ears”) levers completely on the hose. (11) Open fitting box and open internal valves as required. (12) Connect the appropriate leading arms When connecting a loading arm coupler to the trailer pipe, slide the collar on the adapter before actuating the lever, which locks the collar and opens the valve. Do not force the collar on with the lever cam. This damages the lever arm and shear pin. (13) Open internal valves as required. (14) Clear registers and set presets for the proper gallons for each compartment. Know the capacities of all compartments on the truck. The pre-set counter must never be set to an amount greater than the legal/safe fill capacity of the compartment being filled. (15) Start the appropriate product pumps. (16) At each meter: (a)Verify product, pre-set gallon amount and loading arm connection to the correct compartment. (b)Actuate start mechanism. (c)Verify that the pre-set meter countdown is working properly. (d)Verify there are no leaks. (17) Observe slow-flow shutdown of all meters. If slow-flow does not engage at 50-30 gallons, stop flow immediately by pressing the stop button on pre-set. Do not bypass slow-flow. Report to management. (18) After each compartment is loaded, close the internal valve for the compartment. When a compartment is filled beyond safe-fill capacity, the loading rack high level control monitor will not permit further loading. If additional loading is necessary, the driver must follow local procedures for draining product (which will include notifying plant management) so that the loading rack high-level control monitor returns to a permissive state. On units equipped with an on-board overfill indicator, it may be necessary to press a reset button to get a green light on the rack monitor. (19) After loading is completed, disconnect and stow loading arms. (20) Make sure drop heads are hooked up and the interlock bar is down and locked. (21) Close fitting box doors and secure. (22) Disconnect vapor recovery hose. Secure vapour hose to its holder on the rack and lock cam-lock (“ears”). (23) Disconnect high level fiber optic cable and secure it. Remember, this is the first thing connected and the last disconnected. (24) Immediately look down the right side of the truck to ensure that all loading equipment has been disconnected and stowed in its proper position. (25) Move the unit from the loading rack to the designated parking area. (a) Set parking brakes (b) Shut off engine Do not leave unit under rack area after loading (26) Report any spills or loading rack equipment malfunctions to plant management. (27) Collect bill of lading/invoice and all other necessary documents. This procedure may vary for each loading terminal. (28) Ensure that the OSHA product identification labels and the emergency response guidebook are available in the truck cab (29) Note: These procedures may change a little from one loading facility to another. You must become familiar with each loading facility’s rules and regulations to do a good job. P1176: Rear O2S correction limit obtained
Meaning
Rear O2S correction limit obtained is the generic description for the P1176 code. But the manufacturer may have a different description for your model and year of vehicle.
Possible causes
Faulty O2 sensor
Faulty failed MAF sensor
Vacuum leak on engine
Lean air/fuel ratio
