How did you meet your spouse? I met my spouse at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State during a student union campaign. We became friends and like they say, the rest is history. How did you know she was your wife? I didn’t know instantly that she would be my wife. But as things evolved, I was sure I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. I particularly decided I was going to marry her because she is a quiet person and also has a positive attitude to everything For how long did you court before you married? My wife and I courted for five years before we got married. When did you get married? I got married in 2000. What stood out for you on your wedding day? What stood out to me on our wedding day was how our families came together and accepted both of us. We enjoyed the support and acceptance of the family. What lessons has marriage taught you? Marriage is a school on its own and one keeps learning until the final day. But the two major lessons I have learnt that keep a marriage are patience and sacrifice. One must be patient enough to endure one another because we aren’t perfect. Also, one must be able to make sacrifices for each other and also adapt to any situation with one’s partner. What is your advice to young people on marriage? My advice to young people on marriage is to be patient with one another and know that everything is not about money. What matters is showing one another love and accepting one another. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
