Zigzag Nation has commenced its empowerment programme for Nigerian youths, focused on skills development and job creation. According to a statement by the organisation on Tuesday, the initiative is an empowerment programme for Nigerian youths focusing on job creation and self-employment. Speaking on the initiative, the Chairman, ZigZag Nation, Mr Obafemi Amu, said, “In line with its Afrocentric stance, the empowerment programme will subsequently be open to African youths as Zigzag nation embodies a cross-pollination of different African people of positive vibrations under one nation. “Though global in outlook and orientation, the Zigzag Nation remains, for now, an African platform for people of different cultures to showcase their talents.” Amu added that a 9mobile phone number would be assigned to each prospect who will, in turn, visit any 9mobile centre to activate the phone number, with a SIM card including special benefits such as unlimited calls to all members, 1.5GB data and two-way authentication for security purpose. Amu said, “After the activation, the prospective beneficiary will be expected to set up his Zigzag passport, which gives access to many financial benefits. “The focus group of beneficiaries remains the youths under the broad category of students, merchants, artisans, workers and a host of others. “Every active prospect will set up a personal savings account with his group of six to twenty persons he attracted to Zigzag Nation. “On full commencement, each group of prospective beneficiaries will set up their savings group chat box showing all members and their status, total amount pooled, and access to borrowing funds in less than one minute.” Copyright PUNCH.
