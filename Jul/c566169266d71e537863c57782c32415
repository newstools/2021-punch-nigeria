Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has admonished muslims to lay aside religious and tribal sentiments in the interest of Nigeria’s peace. This was made known by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor, Taiwo Adisa, in a statement on Monday titled, ‘Eid-el-Kabir: Makinde congratulates muslims.’ The statement quoted Makinde as admonishing Muslim faithful to “lay aside all forms of religious, ethnic and tribal sentiments, in the interests of unity, peace, progress and prosperity of the state and country.” Makinde added, “It was regrettable that Muslims in the state and across the country cannot observe the 2021 Hajj in Saudi Arabia as a result of COVID-19. “This situation should be seen as part of the sacrifice we all have to make at this time, as a way of emulating Prophet Ibrahim. “But despite the current COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the whole world, the Almighty Allah allowed Muslims in Oyo State to join the Muslim Ummah in making supplications for the forgiveness of our sins. “I am grateful to my Muslim brothers and sisters and residents of the state for remaining steadfast despite the situation imposed on us by the COVID-19 pandemic.” The Governor used the opportunity to call on muslim faithfuls to observe social distancing and other COVID-19 precautions. “We should ensure the wearing of face and nose masks, regular washing of hands and ensuring social distancing. “We must  abide by the advisories already issued by the Oyo State COVID-19 Task Force and adopt the Own Your Action slogan in order to save ourselves and our community from the pangs of the pandemic,” he said.
