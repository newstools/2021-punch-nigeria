Casualties in the food poisoning incident that occurred in Banni community of Kaiama Local Government Area of the Kwara State increased to five on Friday evening, following the death of the mother of two sons, Umar and Kadir, who had died on Thursday. Four members of the family of Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar of Olori’s compound, Banni, comprising his two sons, Umar Mohammed (25 years) and Kadir Mohammed (18 years) and two grandsons identified as Umar and Bashiru died as a result of poison suspected to be in their food. It was gathered that the mother of the victims, who had been hospitalised at the General Hospital, Banni last Thursday, died on Friday. Sunday PUNCH learnt that two other members of the family were in critical conditions at the hospital. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Raji Razak, was said to have visited the hospital and ordered for the immediate transfer of the two family members to a better hospital in Ilorin. Reacting to the issue, Razak said doctors were still trying to stabilise them. He said “Yes, we have ordered their relocation to Ilorin and right now, what is paramount to us is getting them stabilised. I cannot say more than that for now.” The Public Relations Officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kwara State Command, Mr Babawale Afolabi, confirmed the development.
