Belgium captain Eden Hazard lost his fitness race and was left out of the matchday squad for Friday’s Euro 2020 quarter-final against Italy, but playmaker Kevin De Bruyne started in Munich. Manchester City star De Bruyne shook off an ankle injury to face Italy at the Allianz Arena with Hazard sidelined by a hamstring injury. In Hazard’s absence, his place in the Belgian attack goes to Jeremy Doku of Rennes in the only change from the side which beat holders Portugal 1-0 in the last 16. Defender Jan Vertonghen will skipper Belgium. Italy made two changes from the side which beat Austria after extra time in the last 16. Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini returns after injury, replacing Francesco Acerbi in defence. Federico Chiesa’s goal after coming off the bench in the last round earned him a start ahead of Domenico Berardi.
