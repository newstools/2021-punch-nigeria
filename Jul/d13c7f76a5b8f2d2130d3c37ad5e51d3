Nigeria forward, Taiwo Awoniyi, has been handed a chance to stake a claim for a place in the Liverpool squad ahead of next season after he was included in The Reds’ 34-man squad for their pre-season tour of Austria, Saturday PUNCH reports. The Reds will start their preparations for the 2021/22 campaign in Salzburg, Austria, on Monday, according to the club’s website. The 23-year-old, who joined Liverpool in August 2015 from Nigeria’s Imperial Academy, has been sent out on loan from Anfield seven times since he joined the club. But he could make his first appearance in the colours of The Reds during pre-season after he was granted a Work Permit in May. The former youth international has enjoyed loan spells with German club FSV Frankfurt, Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, Belgian outfits Royal Excel Mouscron (twice) KAA Gent and Mainz (Germany). New signing Ibrahima Konate is among the players due to begin training on Monday following his transfer from RB Leipzig. Other notable players in the squad are James Milner, Adrian, Ben Davies, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Joel Matip, Nat Phillips, Divock Origi, Ben Woodburn, Rhys Williams, Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Naby Keita, Curtis Jones, Marko Grujic, Harvey Elliott, Loris Karius and Takumi Minamino. Assistant manager Pepijn Lijnders said, “We look forward to going to Austria again for the start of our pre-season. All the conditions to prepare the team there are just at a very high level. “We will use this to go back to basics. When you ask a lot from your players you have to give a lot as well – and we find all of this in Austria.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
