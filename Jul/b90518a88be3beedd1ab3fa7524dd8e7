The Kano State House of Assembly has summoned the suspended chairman of the state public complaint and anti-corruption commission, Muhuyi Magaji-Rimingado, to appear before its ad-hoc committee investigating a petition against him on Wednesday (today). Recall that the Assembly had last week suspended the chairman for one month following a petition it received against him from the Accountant General of the state. The letter of invitation sent to Muhuyi  Rimingado was signed by the Deputy Director, Legal Services Committee Secretary, Abdullahi A. Bature Dal, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH on Tuesday. “Iam directed to write and invite you to a meeting of the ad hoc committee investigating a complaint against you as the then chairman of Kano State Public Complaint and Anti-corruption Commission. “The meeting is scheduled to take place at conference Hall of Kano State House of Assembly on the 14th July, 2021 by 12noon promp,” the letter reads partly. However, a reliable source told our correspondent that that the suspended chairman might not appear before the House as he had yet to be served with the copy of the petition. Copyright PUNCH.
