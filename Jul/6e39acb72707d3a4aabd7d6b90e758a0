Members of staff of Imo State Polytechnic, Umuagwo in Ohaji/Egbema council area of the state, have expressed displeasure over what they termed “improper placement of salaries” by the authorities of the institution. It was gathered on Monday that senior lecturers were currently receiving the same salary as junior ones owing to the wrong salary placement. A reliable source from the polytechnic expressed bitterness about the issue, adding that the situation was generating ripples in the school environment. He said, “Presently at IMOPOLY, a junior lecturer is earning the same salary as senior lecturers. The question is who are the cabals behind the missing money? Who placed these senior lecturers wrongly and for what purpose?” However, the IMOPOLY Chairman of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic, Ugorji Onyemachi expressed his indignation that since some of the members were promoted to the position, the salary scale that follows such promotion had not reflected. He wondered if promotion could only be seen on papers without having any impact on salaries. He pointed out that such an act had lingered in the institution for years and remained untreated. The ASUP Chairman, while commending the state Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, for increasing their salaries from 70 per cent to 100 per cent, added that such executive decision was able to save them the stress of incessant protests.
