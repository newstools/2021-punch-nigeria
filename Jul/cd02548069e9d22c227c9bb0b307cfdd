Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has appealed to Muslims and traditional worshipers in the state to allow the court to decide on the issues bordering on the attack on a mosque in Osogbo, allegedly by some masqueraders. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, on Friday, said Oyetola “in the wake of the clash between a group of traditional worshippers and Muslims in a part of Osogbo, the state capital,” condemned the development and directed the police to get to the root of the matter and ensure that justice was served. Omipidan noted that Osun and its people were known for peace and urged all to avoid acts that could tarnish the enviable recognition. He noted that religious intolerance was injurious to the unity and collective peace of Osun, adding that residents must respect the state’s unique diversity. He then appealed to parties involved in the court case to allow the judicial process to run its full course. The statement read, “I appeal to both parties to sheathe their swords and toe the line of peace and the law. Since the matter is already in court, both parties should remain calm and allow the process to run its full course. We are known for peace as a people. We should all do all in our powers to sustain that recognition in our collective interest.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
