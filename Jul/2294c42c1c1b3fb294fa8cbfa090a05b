A matron in the General Hospital, Iperu Remo, Ogun State, has died in a lone accident on Friday and her husband sustained injuries when their vehicle veered off the road into a bush. Our correspondent gathered that the Sport Utility Vehicle number plate APP 347 GF, was travelling to Abeokuta from Iperu when the accident occurred at a spot called Onipepeye, along the Abeokuta-Siun-Sagamu Road. The spokesperson for Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the accident. Akinbiyi said the accident occurred around 8.21am, adding that speeding caused the accident. He said the unnamed matron was with her husband in the car on her way to sit for a promotion interview holding at the state secretariat, Oke Mosan, in the state capital. Akinbiyi said, “According to an eyewitness account, the vehicle was coming from Iperu to Abeokuta, with the driver (husband) and his wife; a matron at Iperu General Hospital, to Abeokuta for a promotion interview, when he suddenly lost control of the vehicle, due to speeding, and ran into the bush. The matron died on the spot and her corpse has been deposited at the Ijaiye General Hospital morgue in Abeokuta.” He added that the injured husband was still in the same hospital receiving treatment. Akinbiyi said the vehicle had been taken to the Obafemi-Owode Police Station.
