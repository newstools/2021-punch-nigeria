Ace comedian, Debo Adebayo, fondly known as Mr. Macaroni, says he has donated a sum of N500,000 to the family of Jumoke Oyeleke, the shop attendant who was allegedly killed by stray bullet believed to have been fired by the police at the Yoruba Nation rally in Ojota, Lagos. The incident happened on Saturday, July 3, 2021. The comedian also shared a video earlier posted by Dabira, showing the appalling condition of living of Jumoke’s mother. The voice in the video states that the woman who conducted her around was Jumoke’s aunt. See the video:  Mr. Macaroni made this known on Saturday via his verified Twitter handle @mrmacaronii. Agitators for the Yoruba Nation had gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota that July 3 amid the presence of armed policemen and soldiers. Jumoke, 25, displayed soft drinks at her boss’ shop located in a compound close to the rally ground when security men chased some agitators into the premises. She was reportedly hit by a stray bullet and she died on the spot. In a series of tweets on Saturday [today], Mr. Macaroni states, “I visited the family of the late Jumoke Oyeleke; the 25yrs old that was killed during the Yoruba Nation Rally. They need all the support they can get right now. I have donated N500,000 today and I plead with all those who can to kindly support the family.” The comedian then shared a fundraising link for the family, calling on all members of the public to donate. He wrote further, “Also important to note is that Jumoke (the deceased) was the breadwinner of the house. She was a sales attendant at a beverage store and she used the little she made to sustain her mother and 3 siblings. As it is, the family has nothing. “As of the time of my visit, Neither the government nor police force had taken responsibility. The family despite their state of mourning have been told to bear all responsibilities. This is heartbreaking. Very very.”
