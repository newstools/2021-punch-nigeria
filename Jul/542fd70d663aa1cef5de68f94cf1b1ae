Plain-clothed policemen from the Nigeria Police Force, Abuja, on Tuesday, arrested the Special Adviser to the Cross River State Governor on Cocoa Development and Control, Oscar Ofuka, in Calabar. The incident happened on the premises of the Cross River Broadcasting Corporation, where Ofuka was scheduled to begin the distribution of cocoa seedling to farmers in the southern senatorial district of the state. The Deputy Governor, Prof. Ivara Esu, was also expected as part of the exercise. PUNCH Metro gathered that workers of the corporation who tried to prevent Ofuka’s arrest were threatened by the gun-wielding policemen, who sped off with him in a red Ford pickup truck. A witness said the cops were mistaken for abductors, adding that when she attempted to prevent Ofuka’s arrest, the gunmen sprayed her eyes with a “pepperish substance.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said the governor’s aide was not abducted. She noted that the policemen, who were from the force headquarters, did not follow proper documentation. “We intercepted them at the Jonathan Bypass and brought them back to the command. Everything has been resolved,” she added. The state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande, said Ofuka’s arrest was based on a petition written against him from his community. Copyright PUNCH.
