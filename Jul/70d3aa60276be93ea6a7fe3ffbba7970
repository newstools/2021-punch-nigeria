The Senate on a Wednesday passed a bill to upgrade the Maritime Academy, Oron in Akwa-Ibom State into a full-fledged University of Maritime Studies. Also passed was a bill to establish the Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Ogoja, Cross River state. Both bills were passed by the upper chamber after the presentation and consideration of two separate reports by the Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND. Senator Sandy Onor (PDP, Cross River Central), presented the report on behalf of the Committee’s Chairman, Ahmad Babba Kaita (APC, Katsina North). He said upgrading the Academy into a university would help Nigeria to achieve the prerequisites of the International Maritime Organization convention on standard of training, certification and watch-keeping for seafarers. He said, “The maritime environment requires highly trained personnel to manage the country’s enormous natural endowment and resources on our offshores, international shipping, oil and gas and expansion of coastline with waterways for a viable coastal and inland water transport industry.” He added that the upgrade of the Maritime Academy into a university would benefit host communities in the South-South geopolitical zone and Nigeria as a whole. Meanwhile, the Senate on Wednesday received the report of the Committee on Education (Basis and Secondary) on oversight visits to Ministry, Departments and Agencies. Copyright PUNCH.
