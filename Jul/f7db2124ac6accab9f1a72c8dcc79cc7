The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has told the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra to discontinue linking him to the rearrest of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. IPOB spokesperson, Emma Powerful, in an earlier statement, had listed those who would “be made to pay for their satanic role in Kanu’s rearrest.” The proscribed group named Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano, and businessman, Emeka Offor, on the list. “We want to put it on record that these traitors – Nyesom Wike, Willie Obiano, Emeka Offor, Dr Chris Nwabueze Ngige, and their collaborators are to be held accountable to whatever happens to Nnamdi Kanu. They shall surely pay for their satanic role in the abduction and rendition of our leader. “Should anything happen to our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the fate of Judas will be more honourable than what will befall these traitors,” the statement read in part. In reaction, Ngige’s media office on Saturday in a statement said the minister did not have the time to involve himself in such matters as he has his hands full as a minister. It read in part, “Ngige is occupied, involved and engrossed with his duties as the Minister of Labour and Employment, member of the Federal Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery, and member of the Economic Sustainability Committee headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with the mandate to tackle the challenges and fallout of COVID-19. “It is, therefore, unthinkable that somebody with grey matter in his brain, except if he is hallucinating like the IPOB spokesman, could accuse a very busy minister like Senator Ngige of being part of a ‘conspiracy’ for the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu.” Copyright PUNCH.
