Over 50 per cent of crops produced in Nigeria by farmers are destroyed by pests annually, the Pest Control Association of Nigeria has said. It said the destruction usually occurred before and after the crop harvesting period, stressing that it had become crucial to devise ways to reduce these agricultural losses. The Chairman, PECAN, Abuja Chapter, Terungwa Abari, told journalists in Abuja that international statistics at the disposal of the association showed that pests destroyed about 50 per cent of crops produced globally. He, however, noted that the level of destruction in Nigeria was higher considering the poor agricultural practices across the country. Abari said, “Pests destroy crops in pre and post-harvest periods. Right from the cultivation stage, that is from when you start your crop production, you have all sorts of pests, weeds and sometimes even beetles. “They are there even before the stage of harvesting and they destroy a lot of the food that should have ordinarily been produced if not for these pest challenges. “And after the production, in terms of storage and transportation, most of the harvested produce are further exposed to a lot of damage caused by pests.” Copyright PUNCH.
