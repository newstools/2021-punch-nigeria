The Presidency has reacted to the promotion of senior officers of the Nigeria Police Force and the exemption of a former acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, from the list of newly promoted Assistant Inspectors-General of Police. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Thursday distanced the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), from the exercise Magu, who was sacked by the President after a report by the Justice Isa Salami-led panel set up to investigate the EFCC, was reported to have been selected for promotion from the rank of commissioner of police to AIG. However, after the list was published, Magu’s name was absent. Reacting in a statement, Shehu said, “President Buhari, or any Nigerian President for that matter, is not responsible for promotions in the police. That is the business of the Police Service Commission. In the case of the gentleman in question, who is currently under investigation, common sense dictates that his eligibility will be determined by that outcome. “The PSC could have given you the correct position on this if there was an effort to reach them.”
