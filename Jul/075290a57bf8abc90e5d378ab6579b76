Spanish Segunda side, Leganes, are prepared to listen to offers for defender Kenneth Omeruo, after failing to gain promotion to the topflight league. Leganes missed out on LaLiga via the playoffs, which has pushed the Nigerian closer to the exit door this summer. The 27-year-old, valued at €2m, had a season marred by injuries, and made a total of 28 appearances for the Madrid-based club in all competitions, scoring once. Omeruo has three years left on his current deal but revealed that the club won’t accept a loan offer but an outright sale. “I still have a contract with Leganes but I’m hoping to find a team in LaLiga, the team (Leganes) said if they don’t get promotion to LaLiga, they will let me go but they insist they still want me because they want to try and come up again next season,” Omeruo said. “They also understand that I want to play better, I want to be in the first league, so the only option they gave is if a team comes to buy, they are not taking loan and I respect their decision because I also need to respect my contract.” Copyright PUNCH.
