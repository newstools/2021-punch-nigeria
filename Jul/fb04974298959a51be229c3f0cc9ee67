AFOLARIN J.D, Alagbado, Lagos State: The directive given to media houses by the National Broadcasting Commission on how to report terror attacks is lamentable. This is the worst civilian regime in Nigeria since 1999. It is advisable that the Federal Government should rather close all media houses. Furthermore, it should build prison yards, acquire more guns, handcuffs for the security agents including the almighty DSS to prepare for 200 million Nigerians. We are already in one chance (apologies to Fela Anikulapo-Kuti), a reign of terror, back to 1984. I wonder why Nigerians donâ€™t learn from the past. I am shocked the broom party could be this bad, confused, lacks direction due to nepotism. Hunger and starvation everywhere due to the Fulanisation agenda by AK 47 in herdsmen possession, yet the DSS has never arrested any even those who killed an Army General now. It is a big shame. What a nation, what a failed state.
