A kidnapped first class traditional ruler in Kogi State, the Adogu of Eganyi, HRH Muhammed Adambe, has been freed by his abductors after five days in captivity. The royal father was released over the weekend, a source close to the Palace said. The source said that the royal father could not tell exactly where he was taken to but believed that it was outside Ebiraland. He praised Almighty God for the safe return of the Royal father, adding that he came back unhurt. It would be recalled that the monarch was kidnapped on Tuesday along Okene â€“ Ajaokuta Road while returning to his domain after an engagement in Okene. The kidnappers had earlier placed a ransom of N30m on him, raising concerns over how the community would raise such huge amount of money. However, the source could not tell whether ransom was paid to secure the release of the traditional ruler from his abductors who had earlier reduced the ransom from N30m to six million naira as of Friday evening. The Police Public Relations Officer for Kogi Police Command, DSP William Ayah, while confirming the release of the royal father, said he was not aware of any payment of ransom.
