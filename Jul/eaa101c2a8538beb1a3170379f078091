A  former Gombe State gubernatorial aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Muhammad Barde, has dumped the party. He left the APC to join the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, at a ceremony in Gombe on Monday. He berated the APC-led administration in the state for the poor feeding which has become the lot of public-school pupils in the state. Barde said the annual budgetary allocation of 49 million naira for 42 secondary schools with the population of 16,411 students is unacceptable. Barde said, “The state government only spends N49,916m to feed them for a whole year. That means the state government spends only N8 or 2-naira 70kobo for 3 square meals is unacceptable. “How can anything good come out of our education system. How do you expect the state government to paint buildings and expect that its infrastructure and our social infrastructure has crumbled in this state? We have 42 secondary schools in Gombe State, with 16, 411 students.” Also speaking during the event, State Chairman of the PDP, Maj. Gen. Abnor Kwaskebe (retd.), said, “PDP is on the match, he is one out of many coming to the PDP because PDP is Gombe State and Gombe state is PDP. “If you make a mistake without correcting it that means you have been defeated but if you make a mistake and you work relentlessly to correct it then you are out to win.” Copyright PUNCH.
