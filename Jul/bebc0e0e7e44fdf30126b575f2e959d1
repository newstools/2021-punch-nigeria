The management team of Cisco Africa has expressed interest in Nigeria’s digital economy to help in boosting the digitalisation process. Cisco’s Senior Vice President, Public Policy and Governmental Affairs for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russia, Ms Pastora Valero, disclosed this while speaking at a virtual meeting initiated by Cisco recently, which had in attendance the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami. This was contained in a statement titled ‘Cisco seeks partnerships with Nigeria’s digital economy, commends Pantami’s digital vision’, which was issued by the minister’s spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman. The statement said the leadership of Cisco Africa Team, on July 13, expressed the organisation’s willingness to partner with the country’s digital economy sector in order to further drive the vision of the Federal Government in the digitalisation process. Valero was quoted as saying, “We have keenly followed your progress and would very much like to be a part of your vision in driving the sector and are open to partnerships in that regard.” Also speaking, Pantami said, “We are championing a paradigm shift in the country leveraging on technology to give preference and priority to proven skills over paper qualifications. Particularly, digital skills.” He urged Cisco to “establish training academies across Nigeria, especially in underserved areas in order to empower citizens with the requisite skills required to maintain global relevance,” adding that a Memorandum of Understanding would be drafted on it.
