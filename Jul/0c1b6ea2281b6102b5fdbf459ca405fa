As an unofficial app, GB WhatsApp is not available for download on Google Playstore or any approved Android app stores. Users download this app from unsolicited platforms and APK download websites which may not be safe. Some download websites may contain viruses that would affect the mobile device and put your smartphone at a greater risk.
