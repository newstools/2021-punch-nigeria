A sick Internally Displaced Person in Nasarawa, Thomas Iowundu, who cried for help two weeks ago to enable him to get medical care, is dead. The IDP Camp Administrator, Nicholas Kwatse, told our correspondent on Tuesday that Iowundu died in the Agyaragu camp last Sunday. He lamented that the victim died without getting proper medical help. “He died on Sunday in the IDP camp after waiting for citizens to come to his aid. But no help came. “Plans are being made for his burial. He was a fine gentleman. He will be sorely missed,” he said. PUNCH Metro had reported that the 42-year-old was critically ill at the IDP camp, as the victim called on the state government and citizens to come to his aid. Iowundu was part of the 12,800 Tiv farmers who recently fled their communities due to the unrest in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
