The House of Representatives’ Committee on Ecological Fund on Monday asked the Ecological Fund Office to produce the contractor handling the erosion and flood control project at Kuchiako 1 District, New Hope Avenue in the Kuje area of Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, before Thursday. Chairman of the committee, Ibrahim Isiaka, who issued the directive, also demanded that all the details concerning the project must be made available to the lawmakers who paid an oversight visit to the project. Isiaka, while leading members of the committee on inspection of the project, was miffed by the contractor’s absence from site while no information about the project was made available to the lawmakers. The chairman stated that lawmakers were not on a jamboree while asking the EFO to put inauguration of the project on hold. Isiaka said, “The committee members are feeling that the contractor treated them with disdain. “We are just from Karshi and here we are here in Kuje in the spirit patriotism and nationalism and call to duty by the National Assembly, and in line with the provision of the Constitution of what we should do. “We are now doing it and you see the frustration. It is so sad to come and meet nobody.” The committee had earlier visited the site of the construction of hydraulics structures and road improvement works on eroded Tudun Wada to Karshi Road (Phase 1) and emergency surface protection works on the reclaimed earthwork along Tudun Wada-Karshi Road, Abuja.
