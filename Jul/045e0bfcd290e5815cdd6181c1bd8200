Some communities in Ondo State have said the impact of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s administration has not been felt in their communities, particularly in the areas of primary and secondary education. To this end, they appealed to the state governor to deploy teachers to teach in their schools, which they said were lacking teachers. The traditional ruler of Bolorunduro,  in Ondo North Local Government Area of the state, Oba Babatunde Olasoji, who spoke at the Local Rights Programme – learning and close of meeting, of the ActionAid Nigeria in partnership with the Justice Development and Peace Centre, held in Akure, urged the government to come to their aids. The monarch said, “The presence of the current administration has not been felt in our community. Many local government areas don’t have teachers in the schools; some schools are lacking infrastructural facilities. The Chief Executive Officer of JDPC, Rev. Fr. Damian Adesegha, explained that the commission had been in partnership with ActionAid since 2005. The Country Director ActionAid Nigeria, Ene Obi, said the organisation came to the aid of the communities where impact of government was not being felt. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
