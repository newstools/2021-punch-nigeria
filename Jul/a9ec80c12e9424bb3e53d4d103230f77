A Magistrate Court sitting in Port Harcourt has remanded three persons on charges of alleged fraud, felony and conspiracy of issuing fake affidavits. One of the accused persons, Chidinma Ileokwu, was arraigned for forging three Rivers State High court stamps, the signature of the commissioner for oaths and issuance of affidavits. She was alleged to have committed the offence at the Rivers State University back gate in April. On the other hand, Goodluck Lezoo and Raphael Pie in two counts had conspired amongst themselves to commit felony by defrauding people. Though the trio pleaded not guilty before the Chief Magistrate, Amadi Nna, the court said they committed an offence punishable under the Criminal Code of Law of Federation, 2004. The Chief Magistrate, Nna adjourned, to 23rd of July for bail consideration following application for bail by the defence counsels.
