The case instituted by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project against the Federal Government over the recovered Abachaâ€™s loot could not continue at the Federal High Court Abuja on Thursday due to the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN. Justice Taiwo Taiwo adjourned the matter till July 27 and issued a hearing notice to be served on the AGF. SERAP had sued the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, and the AGF as first and second respondents, respectively. In the suit, SERAP prayed the court to compel the Federal Government to disclose the exact amount recovered from loot of the ex-military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, and details of projects executed with the recovered loot. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
