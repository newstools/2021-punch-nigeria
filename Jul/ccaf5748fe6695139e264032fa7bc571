The Lagos State Government has urged retirees to disregard the rumours and misinformation on the safety of COVID-19 vaccine. The Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said this on Thursday at an interactive session and sensitisation programme for retirees of the Lagos State Public Service in Ikeja. Muri-Okunola said, “You will agree with me that, since the outbreak of COVID-19, it has not been easy for us as a state, being the epicentre of the unprecedented public health challenge. It is indeed gratifying that vaccines are now available for our protection. “Let me quickly add that the Federal and Lagos State governments have done all due diligence to establish the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. I, therefore, urge everyone to disregard any rumour or misinformation making the rounds about the danger involved in the vaccine.” The Head of Service said he had been vaccinated and was sound and healthy. Muri-Okunola also advised the retirees to know that vaccination was not the end of the pandemic, urging them to continue to adhere to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand hygiene, use of face masks and maintaining physical distancing.
