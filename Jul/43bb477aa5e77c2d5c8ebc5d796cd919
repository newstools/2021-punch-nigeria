A 30-year-old man, Shamsudeen Ibrahim, on Monday sued a woman, Hannatu Aliyu, before a Shari’a court sitting in Rigasa, Kaduna for allegedly calling him gay. The complainant who was represented by his lawyer, Alhassan Aliyu, alleged that Aliyu, who is a thrift collector, met his client on the road and asked him about one Murjanatu’s N1,000 daily contribution. “My client categorically told her he was not Murjanatu’s messenger. The defendant rained insults on my client. She called him a pimp who acts like a gay. ”That is why we are here to complain against defamation of character praying court to look into the matter and grant us justice,” he said. In her defence, Aliyu, denied the allegation saying they were untrue. The judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta, granted Aliyu bail on the condition that she provides a reliable surety with a N20,000 bail bond. Abubakar-Tureta adjourned the matter until 2, August for the complainant to present his witnesses.
