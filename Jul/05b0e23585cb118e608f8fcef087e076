The Lagos State Government has introduced the Traffic Management Solution device that will capture traffic law violations and compliance checks in the state. The Commissioner for Transport, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, announced this on Wednesday during a press briefing in Alausa, Ikeja. He said, “The TMS is a traffic law compliance initiative that allows the real-time capture of picture and video evidence of road traffic and vehicle compliance violations as they occur with the use of handheld device.” Oladeinde noted that various vehicle compliance issues will be resolved by the TMS which will simplify the enforcement of traffic laws. “This innovation will align with traffic management structure and address compliance checks such as resolution of gridlock issues caused by traffic violations within the state, eradication of fine payments controversy between the traffic law enforcement officers and violators as only electronic payments guarantee the clearance of a violation from the violators list. The offender may choose to visit a traffic court and present the violation number for the violation he/she wishes to challenge. “With the use of this TMS device the need for traffic law enforcement officials to have any contact with vehicular offenders on the road will be reduced significantly as they will only face the duty of capturing violations.” Copyright PUNCH.
