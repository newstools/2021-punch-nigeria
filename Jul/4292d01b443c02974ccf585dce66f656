Bandits were said to have attacked Ungwan Gajere in the Brinin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Saturday, killing one person and kidnapping seven villagers. Among those abducted by the bandits were women. The hoodlums did not spare livestock either as they made away with no fewer than 50 cows during the raid, which lasted several hours. A source told our correspondent on Sunday that the bandits invaded the village on motorcycles, each carrying three persons. “They shot indiscriminately when they arrived around 2pm yesterday (Saturday),” the source said, adding that three women and four men were kidnapped by the bandits. Details of the attack were still sketchy as of the time of the filing this report. The state police command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, could not be reached. Copyright PUNCH.
