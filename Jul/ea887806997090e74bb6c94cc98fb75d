The Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress in Osun State, Comrade Jacob Adekomi, on Thursday assured workers that the state would not return to era of modulated salary. Adekomi spoke during a meeting the newly elected state officers of Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees held with Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. Adekomi, who declared that Governor Oyetola would be the workers’ candidate in the next year governorship election, told workers not to entertain fear that era of modulated salary might return. He said, “Oyetola remains our candidate as far as next year’s election is concerned. If he wants to go back to half salary, now is the time to do so because some states have cut down salaries of workers. This man is God-sent, he won’t change.” A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, said Oyetola, while speaking at the event, assured to continue to govern the state with fear of God. He said, “this government is defined and ordained by God. When we say we want to do something, we do it by the inspiration of God. During the electioneering when I promised to be paying full salaries, nobody believed it and today it’s a reality because God has helped us to be able to pay full salaries. “So, do not believe the rumour that I am paying full salary because of second term. I have a covenant with God and I will not renege on paying full salary in my second term by the Grace of God. “This is my first time of seeing highly-intelligent and serious civil servants showing their declaration openly and I am highly impressed. Today is a day of joy and I see sincerity of purpose, I see joy radiating on people’s faces, it’s amazing to see that our partnership is working.”
