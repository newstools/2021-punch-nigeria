The Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund has said its 18-storey office complex will address infrastructural deficit while boosting economic and commercial activities through job creation and youth empowerment in the country. The Chairman, Board of Directors, NSITF, Austin Enajemo-Isire, said this at the inspection tour of the ongoing construction of the complex on the Lagos-Badagry International route recently, according to a statement. Enajemo-Isire said the purpose of the inspection was to ascertain the level of work at the site, adding that it would tackle the housing and office needs of both employees and employers. He said, “This project will create jobs for people around, which is part of the Federal Government’s plan to ensure social vices are reduced and insecurity is minimised. “It will be put into effective use for employees and employers all over the federation upon completion. We are here to inspect and assess the level of work and to ensure things are in proper perspective. “This project is a mega one with solid structures. We do not want to cut down on quality. We want to be sure of the adequate quality because of the economic and commercial importance of this project to the entire country. This is what the NSITF wants to do and we are assured of achieving it at a good time.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
