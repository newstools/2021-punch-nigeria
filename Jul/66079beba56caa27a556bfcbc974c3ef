A group of Ogbomoso indigenes known as Ogbomoso First has organised free medical outreach for residents of the town and its environs. The President of O’First, Olusegun Adekunle, said the group made available 3,500 COVID-19 test kits to screen for the virus and was also screened for HIV apart from other sicknesses and ailments. He said the aim was to assist government to reach out to the poor, the sick, the aged and the physically challenged persons so that they could have access to free medicare which he said would also boost productivity. “We are looking at about 3000 persons to benefit from this exercise. About 3,500 rapid test kits for COVID-19 are available to be used for testing. Every beneficiary is made to go through COVID-19 test, “We are also in partnership with the National Action Agency on AIDS for testing. Malaria drugs and others will be given. We have over 6,000 eyeglasses and there will be general medical checks for beneficiaries,” Adekunle said. The Chairman Organising Committee for the outreach, Chief Bayo Babatunde, said O’First could not put a cost to the resources made available for the medical outreach. He said 70 medical doctors were available to attend to beneficiaries, while 100 nurses, 10 traditional medicine practitioners as well as medical students from teachings hospitals of the LAUTECH and Bowen University were also present to assist.
