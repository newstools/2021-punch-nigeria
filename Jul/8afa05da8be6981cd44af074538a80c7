The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has explained the reason behind the establishment of Ife Grand Resort and Industrial Park which was officially opened on Friday by the Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. Oba Ogunwusi, while speaking at the event witnessed by dignitaries across the country, explained that the facility was established for youth development and capacity building. According to a statement by his spokesperson, Moses Olafare, on Saturday, the initiative has created direct employment for over 100 youths, while indirect employment opportunities have equally been created for over 500 others. Oba Ogunwusi, who was represented by a former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, urged stakeholders, especially those in leadership positions to create platforms capable of engaging the youths productively, to discourage them from taking to criminal acts. Fani-Kayode said, “His Imperial Majesty is sending a strong message through Ife Grand Resort and Industrial Park to all of us here that we should engage our youths and offer them dependable mentorship. This is one among several activities of the Arole Oduduwa and I want us all to emulate this enviable gesture.” In his address at the event, the governor, Oyetola, lauded “Ooni’s exemplary passion for socioeconomic development.” “For anyone familiar with Kabiyesi’s trajectory and passion for the youth and socioeconomic development, this indeed would not come as a surprise. I must note that this resort, no doubt, is in tandem with our administration’s development agenda, which is focused on revitalising our economy and stimulating the local economy for maximum growth.” Copyright PUNCH.
