The board of directors of FCMB Group Plc has appointed Yemisi Edun as the managing director of First City Monument Bank Limited. A statement on Tuesday said the announcement was subsequent to the end of service of the bank’s former managing director, Adam Nuru. The bank said the board had earlier reviewed media allegations made in late 2020 against the former managing director and did not establish any contravention of its policies. “The board of directors of FCMB thanks Mr Nuru for his years of dedicated service and wishes him all the best in his future endeavour,” the statement said. FCMB stated that prior to her appointment, Edun was the executive director/chief financial officer of the bank and previously served as the acting managing director. The statement said, “With a work experience spanning nearly 35 years, Edun holds a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the University of Ife, Ile-Ife and a master’s degree in international accounting and finance from the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. “She is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria and a Certified Financial Analyst, CFA Charter holder.” She is also an associate member of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers; an associate member of the Institute of Taxation of Nigeria; a member of Information Systems Audit and Control, U.S.A; and a Certified Information Systems Auditor, the bank said.
