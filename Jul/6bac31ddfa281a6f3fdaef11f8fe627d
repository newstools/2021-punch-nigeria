The Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, has said advocated private sector investment in the country’s health sector, saying the government is striving to attain Sustainable Development Goals three and nine. Osinbajo said this at the unveiling of the modular healthcare facility by Alpha Mead Healthcare Management Services at the Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos. The Vice President was represented by the Senior Special Assistant to President on Sustainable Development Goals, Mrs Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire. “I want to commend Alpha Mead Healthcare Management Service Limited for this initiative.  I applaud the company for harnessing its scientific and technological expertise to make this solution available for use in the country. It will go a long way in supporting our journey towards the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development. “The firm has captured SDG Goal nine, which aims at building resilient infrastructure, promote industrialisation, and foster innovations across sectors including health, innovation, infrastructure, and new skill in technology development. “The modular healthcare facility will help drive Nigeria’s SDGs, including SDG three which is to achieve universal health coverage, a global priority important to the attainment of 2030 agenda, especially in low and medium-income countries,” Osinbajo said. He urged other private sector players to emulate the firm’s gesture, adding that the facility would complement the government’s efforts in transforming medical diagnostics and reduce the barrier to health care access in Nigeria.
