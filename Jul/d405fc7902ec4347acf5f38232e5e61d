Teen model, Kara Wrice, drowned in the Meramec River in Castlewood State Park, United States shortly after she had drinks with a friend. Describing Kara as a straight-A student, her father told St. Louise Post-Dispatch that his daughter worked as a lifeguard before the fatal incident on Friday. He further revealed that he wasn’t aware that she was at the park till he and Kara’s mother were informed of her absence. After she was reported missing, the park was closed from the public as multiple law enforcement agencies searched for Kara. According to the St. Louis County police spokeswoman, Tracy Panus said, the downpour that went on for days had caused rivers and waterways to rise, which was dangerous for swimmers. Sixteen-year-old Kara, who was a rising junior at Webster Groves High School, was described by her dad as a “great person.” “She was a straight-A student. She was also a teenager who made a very not-good decision,” he said. “She had got my personality; she was a rock star. She didn’t have an enemy — very extroverted. She left a large footprint — many people have reached out to me since,” her father revealed. Kara modeled for Famous Footwear, a division of Clayton-based Caleres, and was once signed to Mother Model Management, while she was 14.
