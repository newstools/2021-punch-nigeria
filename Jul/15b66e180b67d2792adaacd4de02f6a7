Multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Durban, South Africa, Aspen Pharmacare, has secured a loan of €600m (N292bn) from the United States, World Bank and some European countries including France and Germany to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Aspen Pharmacare, said to be the largest pharmaceutical company in Africa, has branches in other African countries including Nigeria. The decision to loan the company N292bn to produce COVID-19 vaccines was announced at the Digital Press Briefing on the United States’ Support for COVID-19 Vaccine Manufacturing and Production in Africa. The telephonic event which held on Thursday was monitored by our correspondent. Speaking at the event, the Chief Operating Officer of the US International Development Finance Corporation, Mr David Marchick, stated that COVID-19 posed an “extraordinary threat” to the lives and livelihoods in Africa, with 4.7 million confirmed cases so far and unconfirmed cases much likely higher. He noted that the challenges in Africa were limited manufacturing, poor logistical and supply chains, and limited resources to produce or obtain vaccines. He said, “That’s why today (Thursday), we’re announcing that our agency, the Development Finance Corporation, in cooperation with the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, our French colleagues, and our German colleagues – the German development bank (DEG) and the French development bank (Proparco) – will together provide long-term, stable financing to Aspen Pharmacare to better enable them to support the pandemic response in South Africa and, importantly, across the continent.
