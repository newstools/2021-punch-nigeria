The Lagos Waste Management Authority has announced that it will conduct major enforcement operations in Festac, Lagos, over the next few weeks. This was made known in a statement by the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of LAWMA, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni. Odumboni said that the exercise was necessary to stem the activities of cart-pushers that had left the environment in a deplorable condition. According to the LAWMA boss, the activities of the outlawed cart-pushers had increased the level of indiscriminate disposal of waste at unauthorised locations such as drainage channels, road medians and uncompleted buildings. He vowed that the enforcement exercise would be carried out to restore sanity to the environment and forestall the negative consequences of indiscriminate dumping of refuse, especially during the current rainy season. Odumboni called on residents to shun patronage of cart-pushers whose activities jeopardised the health and safety of residents, stressing the need to patronise assigned PSP operators and to pay for waste services promptly. While maintaining that the State government, through LAWMA, had empowered PSP operators, to render quality waste management services across the metropolis, Odumboni enjoined residents to call LAWMA toll-free numbers for all waste management related matters.
