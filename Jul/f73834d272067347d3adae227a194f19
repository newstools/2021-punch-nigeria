Gunshots have been fired by policemen present at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota, Lagos as the Yoruba nation rally begins. This was after the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, addressed journalists at the venue saying no rally is allowed in Lagos. However, some Yoruba nation agitators dared the security operatives by spreading banners and flyers to announce their arrival and presence. A few minutes later, shots were fired and hot water from an armoured tank was sprayed to disperse them. Some of the agitators were seen getting dragged into an armoured tank by policemen. The Lagos State Police Command had in separate statements on Thursday and Friday warned the agitators to shelve the rally, siting intelligence report that the protest would be infiltrated by hoodlums. But the organisers of the rally comprising Sunday Igboho-led group and the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, led by a renowned historian and former senator, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, insisted that it would hold as scheduled.
