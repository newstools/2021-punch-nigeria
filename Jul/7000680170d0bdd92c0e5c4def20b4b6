The Nigerian Exchange Limited announced on Wednesday that its parent company, the NGX Group Plc, engaged analysts ahead of its planned listing. According to a statement, NGX Group held an analyst call on Wednesday as the management of the group and its entities provided key insights into the setup of the new structure, current operations and plans. The virtual event was hosted by the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group, Mr Oscar Onyema. In attendance were the CEO of the NGX, Mr Temi Popoola; the CEO, NGX Regulation Limited, Ms Tinuade Awe; and the acting CEO, NGX Real Estate Limited, Mr Gabriel Igbeka. The statement said investor relations consultants, Vaerdi, and financial advisers from Rand Merchant Bank acted as facilitators for the event. Onyema took the audience right back to the period of demutualisation before clearly highlighting its benefits and how the group was positioned to exploit the new world of possibilities that had opened up. He said, “At the start of demutualisation, NGX Group had 432 shareholders, a number that has doubled since over-the-counter trading commenced. This shows strong prospects for the new types of investors that NGX Group can attract once it is listed on the NGX.” The analysts were said to have engaged the CEOs on issues around the activities of NGX by way of listings and the introduction of exchange-traded derivatives to the market. The statement said the NGX RegCo had put in place stringent policies to maintain independence in its regulation of NGX Group, NGX and the capital market as a whole. It said the NGX RegCo would open up new business lines for the group. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
