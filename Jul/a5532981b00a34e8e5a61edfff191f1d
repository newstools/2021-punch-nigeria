The police team investigating last Sunday alleged attack on Kamorudeen Central Mosque, Oluode Aranyin, Osogbo, Osun State, has detained two more suspects in connection with the incident. The leader of the Kamorudeen Society, Imam Quoseem Yunus, it was gathered, was invited by the Inspection-General of Police Intelligence Response Team around 10pm on Wednesday for questioning and was subsequently detained. Also, Fashola, the son of Bale Esu and the owner of the Esubiyi masquerader, Chief Kayode Esuleke, has been detained since Tuesday. PUNCH Metro learnt that the invite to the leader of the Kamorudeen Society was sequel to a fresh complaint from the masquerader, who said some of his followers were also injured during the clash, which claimed one life and left 19 others injured. The President, Traditional Religion Worshippers in Osun State, Dr Oluseyi Atanda, in an interview on Thursday, confirmed the arrest of Fashola, who he said was arrested in his house in Osogbo. Atanda, however, said the traditionalists would pursue an amicable resolution of the crises. Counsel for the Kamorudeen Society, Mr Hashim Abioye, said Yunus was invited and detained after a complaint of assault occasioning harm was lodged against the society by the masqueraders. He said, “There is murder on the side of the masqueraders and on the chief Imam’s side is assault.  Assault is a bailable offence, unlike the masqueraders.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
