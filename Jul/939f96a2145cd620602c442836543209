A socio-political organisation, Arewa Consultative Forum, has expressed concern over the increasing wave of insecurity across northern states. It also said thet youth unemployment in the region was a time bomb. Rising from a meeting of its board of trustees in Kaduna on Wednesday, the ACF noted that despite the efforts of the Federal Government, Boko Haram, bandits kidnappers, clashes between herders and farmers had been on the increase. In a communiqué signed by Shehu Malami at the end of the meeting and made available to newsmen by the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Emmanuel Yawe, said  the ACF also decried a situation where the north was left without a single financial institution to advance the economic growth and fortunes of the region. The statement added, “Similarly, the board decried the lack of media houses in the north to keep the citizens of the north well informed. “The board observed that without a sound financial foundation and backing, the north will always remain backward. “On the problems of unemployment in the north, the board said it is regrettable that the north has not realised it is sitting on a time bomb which can explode at any time. “The board resolved that there is the need to take immediate action to salvage the youth from lethargy, drugs and substance abuse, despondency and banditry.” On the trial of the self-declared leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, the forum hailed the Federal Government, security agencies, and all those behind the arrest and repatriation. The ACF said the development showed that the government was capable of handling security matters. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
