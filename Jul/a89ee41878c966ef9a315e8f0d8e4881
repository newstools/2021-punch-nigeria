David Owaboye, President, Initiative for Global Change, Aguda, Surulere, Lagos State, 08033252129: The federal character principle, enshrined into the Nigerian constitution since 1979, is to ensure that appointments into public offices fairly reflect the linguistic, ethnic, religious and geographical diversities of the country. Application of the principle in the federal civil service and the military has been something that has caused rifts and arguments in so many a quarter but not as much as it has done in recent years under the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Presently in the country, the federal character which gives quotas “equally” to different tribes and ethnic groups supposedly, has lost its fragrance and glamour and looks dead and buried. Unlike before when every parastatal has representatives from all the tribes and geopolitical zones, it’s very difficult to look at the system today and see a true reflection of that word “federal character”; the military, the police, the judiciary just to name a few, all have one way or the other betrayed that quota system which the country vowed to stand on in order to ensure equity and fairness in all spheres and strata. The divisiveness which the neglect of the so-called federal character has brought in the country recently is better imagined and the worst is that it is still on the rise which is a big stain on the present dispensation. The federal character principle should as a matter of urgency be renamed or scrapped completely and a law be passed that will give absolute power/right to any ruling government to remove and install whomsoever it deems “fit” enough to be in any position irrespective of the person’s zone. This would have removed people from the mindset that they have the right to any position in the country and would in turn also give them hope that when “their brother” assumes office anytime, their turn would come instead of this deceit we are seeing now. It all appears that the government of the day does not in any way trust any other tribe, ethnic group or religion to give them top jobs and sensitive offices bar their “trusted” allies which is a shame. If we say we are bound by law to adopt a particular system of which “federal character” is one of them, then, it’s high time we did the needful which is implementing it not only by rhetoric but by action.
